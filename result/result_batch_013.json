    "content": "1 C. Proposed Commitments  \n139. Petitioners have provided a schedule memorializing various commitments \npertaining to how ALLETE would be governed following an acquisition.1 The schedule, \nattached to the rebuttal testimony of Jennifer Cady, lists 48 commitments, including some \ncommitments that were originally made in the merger agreement, the Petition, or \nPetitioners’ direct testimony as well as other commitments that are new  as of rebuttal.2  \n139A. On July 11, 2025, the Department , the Company  and the Partners filed a \nsettlement stipulation (the “ Stipulation ”). The Stipulation  modified approximately 11 \nexisting commitments , added approximately 30 new commitments , and  adopted but did \nnot modify approximately 26 original commitment s. The comprehensive nature and \nenforceability of these commitments justify approval of the Acquisition, as they not only \nrespond to identified risks but also proactively create meaningful and measurable benefits \nfor Minnesota Power, its customers, and the broader community.  \n \n139B. While the ALJ addressed the Stipulation  at a high level in her Report, the \nCommission notes that the ALJ had only a few days to assess the Stipulation  and did not \naddress the additional Stipulation  commitments or modifications to prior commitments in \nany detail. Rather, the ALJ discussion of each commitment was limited to those identified \nin the schedule attached to the Rebuttal Testimony of Jennifer Cady .  Additionally, while \nthe ALJ Report provides citations to the commitments themselves, the majority of the \nALJ’s statements lack citations or other support for the perceived impact or lack of impact \nassociated with the commitment.   \n140. Commitment 1 addresses the voluntary capital commitment made by Alloy \nParent to the Commission:  \nAlloy Parent commits to provide to Minnesota Power equity \nfinancing, including but not limited to equity infusion, deferral \nor reinvestment of dividends, or a combination of both, in an \namount at least equal to the equity financing required to fund \nMinneso ta Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan reflected in \nits February 2025 10 -K filing, subject to prospective \nreasonable and prudent plan adjustments.3  \n141. Commitment 1 provides that Minnesota Power will have access to equity in \na manner that is not guaranteed through public markets. The commitment is structured \non behalf of Alloy Parent, which is meaningful because that will be the parent of ALLETE \nupon close of the Acquisition and is the entity through which any dividends would be \ndistributed.4 Absent this Acquisition, Minnesota Power, through ALLETE, may need to \n \n1 See Ex.

Investors  in the public market s cannot make this kind of commitment , and \ncould purchase and dispose of ALLETE’s stock in great quantities without making any \ncommitments to the Company or its customers .9 For example, current shareholders \ncannot provide  a commitment to provide any level of funding, nor could the Commission \nor the Company reasonably expect  them to do so.  And existing shareholders could \nchoose to exit their investment at any time by selling their shares without Commission \napproval.  By contrast, the Partners want to commit to ALLETE and to support its capital \nneeds. While ALLETE has stated  in its 10 -K that  it can meet its capital needs, this \nstatement was premised on interim and long -term equity funding provided by the \nPartners .10 Importantly, the Stipulation  includes guarantees that the Partners cannot \nreceive dividends if it fails to provide equity to Minnesota Power, because dividends from \nthe Company will be blocked unless Minnesota Power is adequately financed in \naccordance with this commitment and unless the Company maintains at least one \ninvestment grade credit rating.11  \n 141B. While the ALJ found  that ALLETE could simply defer dividends or issue more \ndebt, public market investors typically do not invest in a company without anticipated \ndividends – especially for utility companies, where stable returns , including through \ndividends,  are a hallmark of the attractiveness of the investment category.12  Issuing more \ndebt to compensate for lack of equity from public markets also does not resolve the need \nfor capital , because it could create other harms that were specifically identified by the \n \n5 Ex.

Two-step acquisitions, involving a tender or exchange offer \nfollowed by a merger allow a public investor  to quickly gain control of a target corporation and then efficiently \nacquire remaining shares through a squeeze -out merger.

First, \nALLETE recently advised investors that it could adequately meet its capital needs for this \nsame five -year period in the public mar kets.16 Second, the Commitment is on behalf of \nAlloy Parent, not the Partners.17 The Partners would have an indirect ownership interest \nin Alloy Parent, but they have not committed to hold that interest for any period,18 nor has \nAlloy Parent committed to hold ALLETE for any period. Third, a five -year capital \ncommitment cannot alone fund Minnesota Power’s efforts to achieve the energy transition \nbecause that transition will extend beyond five years.19 Fourth, the Commitment can be \nmet by deferral or reinvestment of dividends, which is something ALLETE can do without \ngoing private.20 Fifth, nothing in the Commitment prevents ALLETE from borrowing the \nfunds for any equity infusions, and any additional debt in ALLETE and Alloy Parent’s \ncapital structure would increase upward pressure on ALLETE’s cost of debt.21 Finally, the \nCommitment does not guarantee that new equity infusions will be provided at a \nreasonable cost. Instead, the Commitment states that it “will not be used to establish a \nhigher or lower [return on equity].”22 This leaves substantial uncertainty about the future \ncost of equity that Minnesota Power’s ratepayers will pay for the Partners’ capital.  \n142. Commitment 2 states, “Minnesota Power will provide compliance filings on \nequity infusions from and dividends to Alloy Parent in the same manner that the Company \ncurrently provides compliance filings in its capital structure docket.”23 While Minnesota \nPower already is required to provide certain capital structure information, Commitment 2 \nconfirms  that the Commission’s authority over the Company remains unchanged by the \nAcquisition , and further provides information not just with respect to the utility, but also \nwith respect to ALLETE and Alloy Parent, ALLETE’s post -acquisition parent.  \nContinuation of  these compliance filings , including up to the entity that will be the parent \ncompany to the ALLETE holding company,  and detail regarding equity infusions from and \ndividends to Alloy Parent, are consistent with the public interest.24does not provide any \n \n13 Ex.

Commitment 3 states, “ALLETE will not make any dividend or distribution \nthat would cause the actual equity ratio of Minnesota Power to be outside the range \napproved by the Commission.”26 Commitment 3  underscores and confirms  that the \nCommission’s authority over the Company remains unchanged by the Acquisition .27 \nAdditionally, Paragraphs 1.4 and 1.5 of the Stipulation  add further transparency and \nenforceability to the capital requirements, as discussed later in these Findings. does not \nprovide any benefit because ALLETE and Minnesota Power are required to maintain the \nequity ratio range approved by the Commission regardless of whether the acquisition is \napproved.28  \n144. Commitment 4 states, “The Company commits to not make any dividend or \ndistributions unless at least one senior unsecured credit rating is investment grade or \nabove.”29 Commitment 4 protects the Company’s  credit rating, and therefore the cost of \ndebt, and limits the Partners’ ability to take distributions  – which is the source of income \nfrom ALLETE during the Partners’ ownership .30 Currently, there is no regulatory limitation \non when ALLETE may make a dividend or distribution , and no requirement that ALLETE \nmust maintain any senior unsecured credit rating .31 would provide the Partners with an \nincentive to maintain at least one investment -grade senior unsecured credit rating for \nALLETE but would not require it. Moreover, Commitment 4 would still allow ALLETE to \nissue dividends if its other senior unsecured cred it ratings were below investment grade. \nAt best, Commitment 4 is a weak protection against cost -of-debt increases.  \n145. Commitment 5, as modified by the Stipulation , states, “If Minnesota Power’s \ncost of debt increases above current levels within three  five years following the close of \nthe Acquisition, Minnesota ratepayers will be held harmless from any rate impact unless \nMinnesota Power can demonstrate that its increased cost of debt was not caused by the \nAcquisition.  Beginning five years through ten years following the close of the Acquisition, \nMinnesota Power shall bear the burden to explain any cost of debt increase. For  years \nfive through ten, nothing about this shall change the company’s obligation with respect to \nits overall burden of proof under Minnesota law.”32   \n 145A. Commitment 5 protects  customers if the cost of debt were to change as a \nresult of the Acquisition , and creates a standard of proof for Minnesota Power for any \nincreased cost of debt that is higher than the current standard for just and reasonable \n \n25 Evid.

In addition, t he modified terms of Commitment 5 extend the time period  beyond \nwhat was offered in Rebuttal, going beyond what the Company currently is obligated to \ndo. Issuing debt at a parent company level is not unique to private investors, to privately \nowned energy companies, or to the Acquisition , but rather is commonly how debt is raised  \nby utilities, including other utilities in Minnesota .33 This practice, and other  concerns \nrelated to debt as part of the Acquisition,  can be addressed by t he Commission as it will \nretain its full authority to regulate Minnesota Power’s capital structure, including the cost \nof debt and ROE.34    is something of a concession; however, its time -limited nature \nseverely diminishes its value. Any impact to Minnesota Power’s cost of debt from the \nacquisition is unlikely to materialize in a significant way within three years of the \nacquisition closing.  \n146. Commitment 6 states, “ALLETE will use commercially reasonable efforts to \nmaintain its current corporate and facility ratings.”35 Commitment 7 , as modified by the \nStipulation  similarly states, “ALLETE will use commercially reasonable efforts to remain \nrated by at least two credit rating agencies . Neither ALLETE nor Minnesota Power to the \nextent applicable will opt to cease being rated by a credit rating agency.”36 Commitments \n6 and 7  help ensure reasonable costs of capital for customers, as well as stakeholder \ninsight into the Company’s financial health . Currently, Minnesota Power has no regulatory \nobligation to remain rated by any credit rating agency .37 Further, the Petitioners do not \ncontrol credit rating agencies so cannot do more than make efforts to remain rated, and \n“commercially reasonable” is a well -accepted term in commercial markets, underscoring \nthe obligation to act with good faith and in alignment with standard industry practice.38 \nTherefore, these commitments will ensure reasonable costs of capital for customers, as \nwell as stakeholder insight into the Company’s financial health.  provide little benefit \nbecause ALLETE has not established what “commercially reasonable” efforts are in either \ncontext or that it would be reasonable not to use “commercially reasonable” efforts.39 \n147.

Ultimately, the  Commission will have \nthe authority and opportunity to confirm these ring -fencing arrangements as Minnesota \nPower continues to file its annual corporate structure petition and other compliance \nfilings.43 This ring fencing is a necessary measure given the new risks the Acquisition’s \ncorporate structure creates for ALLETE. Bankruptcy of ALLETE would be catastrophic, \nand the Partners proposed measures would decrease, but not eliminated, that risk. But \nCommitment 8 provides little protection against many of the other risks raised by \nIntervenors. The proposed ring -fencing measures are not adequate to fully insulate \nMinnesota Pow er’s ratepayers from higher debt costs resulting from exposure to the risks \nof debt held at Alloy Parent.44 \n148.

Commitments 11 through 14 , as modified by the Stipulation , help ensure  \nthe Acquisition provides continuity in the function of the ALLETE Board. Increasing the \ntotal number of board members from the initial proposal expands the representation of \nindependent directors and those directors not directly appointed by the Partners. Adding \nan additional Minnesota -based director and explicitly stating that  ALLETE’s CEO cannot \nfulfill the Minnesota or Wisconsin resident director requirement s ensures increased ties, \npresence, and knowledge of Minnesota interests within the Board, a requi rement not \ncurrently in place for either Minnesota or Wisconsin. Further , the structure and inclusion \nof independent members ensure that no one Partner may appoint a majority of the \nboard.60 In addition, because CPP Investments and GIP are wholly different entities, they \nwill act as a check on each other . Requiring the members of the Board be selected based \non their  experience in relevant industries ensures a knowledgeable and strategically \ncapable board, a standard that is not currently mandated  for ALLETE’s Board of Directors .    \n150A. In addition to these governance changes, Members of the Board of ALLETE \nwill have defined fiduciary responsibilities consistent with Minnesota law (i.e., the fiduciary \nobligations set forth in Minn. Stat. § 302A.251, and the statutory Standards of Conduct \napplicable pursuant to Minn. Stat. §  302A.361 ). Not all states have Board Standards of \nConduct in addition to fiduciary obligations, such that Minnesota provides particularly \nstringent requirements regardless of whether the company is publicly or privately owned.  \nSuch statutory provisions provid e additional protections .do little to address risks related \nto the Partners’ control of ALLETE’s board.61 Although three directors (including the CEO) \nwould be independent, all directors would be appointed by the Partners.62 The Partners, \nthrough their consent rights over material actions and their right to appoint board \nmembers, would fully control the board and therefore Minnesota Power.63 If conflicts were \nto arise between the interests of Minnesota Power and its ratepayers and the interests of \nthe Partners, the utility perspective might not be sufficiently considered .64 \n151. Commitments 15 and 16 pertain to affiliated interests:  \na. Commitment 15 states, “Minnesota Power will require all suppliers, \nand any industrial customers with contracted rates, to identify \nannually whether they are more than 5 percent owned by CPPIB, \nGIP, or BlackRock. Minnesota Power will list those entities in the \nannual affiliated interest report.”65  \nb.

For many years Minnesota Power has filed with the Commission (a) \naffiliated interest agreements and tax sharing agreements between it and subsidiaries of \nALLETE and (b) its Annual Affiliate Report , which lists all shareholders that own greater \nthan five percent of the outstanding shares of ALLETE’s stock.67 Modified commitments \n15 and 16  will allow stakeholders to analyze affiliated interest issues and protect against \nself-dealing. As Commission Staff noted, “It is unlikely that there are a significant number \nof large or medium -sized publicly -traded companies in the United States that Vanguard \nand/or BlackRock don’t own 5% or more of . . . . Given the nature of Vanguard and \nBlackRock, it is likely that virtually every contract that many, if not all our investor -owned \nutilities undertake with a public traded corporation – and some privately  held businesses \n– would become ‘affiliated interest’ contracts . . . .”68 \n152C. In this proceeding, ALLETE and the Partners have not requested  any \nchange in the status quo relating to affiliated interests , and these proposed commitments \nwill require additional affiliate reporting that is not currently required of ALLETE or any \nother utility . As such, t hese commitments are consistent with  or exceed  the Commission’s \nlongstanding and pragmatic approach to affiliated interests, and provide strong protection \nagainst the risk of self -dealing or preferential treatment. Nor do these commitments \nencompass entities managed or controlled by CPPIB, GIP, Blac kRock or the limited \npartners of GIP Fund V or other GIP funds.69 They therefore do not ensure that the \nCommission would be notified of potentially harmful transactions that do not come within \nthe statute’s definition.  \n153. Commitments 17 and 18 , as modified by the Stipulation , state that the \nCompany will not attempt to recover  Acquisition costs ,  transaction  costs,  transition costs , \nor the acquisition premium  from utility customers . ALLETE and Minnesota Power shall \nnot defer any transaction or transition costs.70 In future rate cases, Minnesota Power shall \nhave the burden to establish through testimony and schedules that no such costs are \nincluded in historical expenses of the operating utility or in the determination of revenue \n \n66 Ex.

Commitments 17 and 18, as modified, are designed to safeguard customer \naffordability and to ensure Acquisition costs are not passed to customers . Such provisions \nare common and appropriate in acquisitions, and have been approved in other utility \nacquisition proceedings.72 Witness Anderson detailed the methods employed to track \nthese expenses  to ensure they are not improperly allocated to customers.73 Witness Cady \nreinforced this, emphasizing the careful tracking mechanisms in place to confirm \ncompliance.74 \n154. Commitments 19 through 21 pertain to pertain to certain protections for, or \nassistance to, low -income customers and reflect an agreement that ALLETE and the \nPartners reached with Energy CENTS Coalition:75  \na. Commitment 19 states that there will be no reduction in Minnesota \nPower’s affordability program (CARE program) budget or the current \nCARE program eligibility process for the duration of the Partners’ \nownership of ALLETE.76 \nb. Commitment 20 states that the Partners will provide a financial \ncontribution of up to $3.5 million to reduce residential arrears to pre -\nCOVID -19 balances or lower.77 \nc. Commitment 21 states that “Minnesota Power and the Partners \naffirm their understanding that the budget billing provisions in \nMinnesota Statutes § 216B.098, subdivisions 2 and 3, refer to all \nresidential customers and is not limited to those who are form ally \nincome -qualified.”78 \n155. Commitments 19 and 21  are significant, tangible, and immediate \ncommitments that are rarely made by a utility’s investors , as nonpayment of arrearages \nare usually borne by other utility customers (including industrial, other  residential , and \nsmall commercial customers) and can raise costs (e.g., bad debt expense) for the utility.  \n \n \n72 In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Merger Agreement between Integrys Energy Group, Inc. \nand Wisconsin Energy Corporation , Docket No. G -011/PA -14-664, Order Approving Merger Subject to \nConditions at 10 (June 24, 2015) (eDocket No. 20156 -111752 -01).  \n73 Ex.

Commitment 19 further ensures that low -income \ncustomers will continue to have access to affordability assistance consistent with current \nlevels, directly addressing concerns about affordability for residential customers.79 \nCommitment 20 is a historic, investor -paid benefit to the Company’s most vulnerable \ncustomers that is not presently available , and it is not clear Minnesota Power could or \nwould make such a commitment  absent the Acquisition and the Partners’ associated \ncommitment of funds.80 The Commission further notes that these funds are committed in \naddition to the commitment of funds to Minnesota Power’s capital plans, and therefore \nprovide an additional benefit to all customers. do not reflect a change from the status quo \nand thus are not benefits of the acquisition.81 The CARE program is a ratepayer -funded \nprogram subject to ongoing Commission review.82 The Commission has consistently \nallowed Minnesota Power to recover through rates the administrative costs of the CARE \nprogram.83 Also, the affordability discount component of the CARE program is currently \nclosed to new applicants, meaning it is no longer available to eligible, but not previously \nenrolled, customers who pay more than 3 percent of their annual income on Minnesota \nPower electric bill.84 With regard to Commitment 20, a commitment to pay down low -\nincome residential arrears is in the public interest.85  \n156. Commitment 22 states that ALLETE’s contributions to the Minnesota Power \nFoundation will not be reduced while Minnesota Power is owned by the Partners.86 \nCommitment 22  provides a commitment to maintain the status quo that does not currently \nexist, and it is not clear that ALLETE could  maintain such contributions absent the \nAcquisition and this commitment.

Commitment 24 states that Minnesota Power will not seek rate recovery of \ninvestor relations costs beginning with its next rate case and continuing as long as the \nPartners own Alloy.94 There is no evidence that Minnesota Power would incur investor \nrelations costs post -acquisition ,95 and would incur current investor relations cost absent \nthe Acquisition.96 Additionally, the Company testified its investor relations costs would \nlikely increase absent the Acquisition due to the Company’s increasing equity needs  and \nserial issuances  and the potential negative market repercussions if the Acquisition is \nrejected.97 Minnesota Power currently recovers 50 percent of its investor relations costs, \nor $174,000 per year, from ratepayers.98 A savings of $174,000 per year is in the public \ninterest and is not a meaningfu  ratepayer benefit , along with other benefit s described \nherein . compared to the risks of the acquisition.  \n \n89 Ex.

Currently, ratepayers cover about half of Minnesota Power’s board \ncompensation and expenses , but the amount is not in the record .102 As discussed with \nCommitment 23, flotation costs, investor relations expenses, and board compensation or \nexpenses for any board member not independent from the Partners totaled roughly $2.5 \nmillion annually for customers in the Company’s 2023 rate case revenue requirement,103  \nand their elimination would be a direct result of the Acquisition and reflect additional \nbenefits of ownership by the Partners.  The dollar savings associated with Commitment \n26 is also not in the record.

If the \nDepartment  or other party  ever perceives that it needs additional information, they will \nhave ample authority and capability to seek that information, and any such requests can \nbe addressed when made.

Furthermore, these \ncommitments are largely unenforceable by the Commission.  \nThe most significant ratepayer benefit that Petitioners offer is up to $3.5 million in low -\nincome residential arrearage forgiveness to reduce arrearages for residential customers \nto pre -COVID balances.155 The proposed forgiveness will run through the ratepayer -\nfunded CARE program.156 The arrearage forgiveness would certainly benefit the \nhouseholds that receive it. However, in 2019 – pre-COVID - customer past due amounts \ntotaled approximately $3.4 million.157 In February 2025, the company reported $4.3 million \nin customer arrearages.158 The Partners could therefore meet this commitment by funding \nless than $1 million in forgiveness.159 Even the full $3.5 million benefit is modest when \ncompared with the rate -related risks of the acquisition. It is also modest when compared \nwith  \nCC. Additional Commitments Contained in the Settlement Stipulation160 \n284. The ALJ Report, due on July 15, 2025, did not have adequate time to fully \nincorporate the Settlement Stipulation  reached between Petitioners and the Department \nand filed on Friday, July 11, 2025.  While the ALJ Report states that the ALJ reviewed the \nSettlement Stipulation  and it did not change her conclusions, this statement does not \nexplain the ALJ’s reasoning nor provide an analysis of the many and significant additional \nterms and commitments in the Settlement Stipulation .  Accordingly, we adopt the \nadditional findings below, reflecting a discussion of each of the additional commitments \nset forth in the Settlement  Stipulation  and not otherwise discussed in the foregoing \nsections of this redline.  \n1. Capital Commitments  \n285. Paragraph  1.4 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new commitment stating \nthat: To ensure enforceability of the capital commitment, ALLETE shall not make any \ndividend payments to Alloy Parent (the entity through which the Partners would receive \nany dividends from the company) unless, at the time the dividend payment would be \nmade, Min nesota Power has been provided sufficient equity capital needed up to that \npoint in time to fund the 5 -year capital investment plan in the February 2025 10 -K, subject \nto prospe ctive reasonable and prudent plan adjustments by the company.161  \n \n155 Evid. Hrg. Tr. Vol. 1 at 29 (Cady).  \n156 Evid. Hrg. Tr. Vol. 1 at 190 (Cady).  \n157 Evid. Hrg. Tr. Vol. 1 at 193 (Cady).  \n158 Evid. Hrg. Tr. Vol. 1 at 195 (Cady).  \n159 At various times throughout this proceeding, Minnesota Power has insisted that the Petitioner’s “intent” \nor “understanding” is different than what is reflect in the written documents. This is one such example. \nMinnesota Power’s apparent reliance on unenfo rceable “understandings” which conflict with the written \nrecord is, at best, naïve. Sophisticated parties, like the Partners, engaging in complex transactions, like the \nAcquisition, rely on written agreements. The Commission should do the same.  \n160 These are new proposed findings to address the Settlement Stipulation , and therefore numbering of \nthese findings picks up with the next finding number after conclusion of the ALJ Report.  \n161 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.4 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 21 of 34\n22 286. Additionally, Paragraph  1.5 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new \ncommitment stating that:  To ensure compliance with this commitment to fund Minnesota \nPower’s 5 -year capital plan, before ALLETE pays any dividend to Alloy Parent during the \nfirst five years after closing, Minnesota Power shall make a filing in its most recent annual \ncapital struct ure docket demonstrating compliance with this commitment. Minnesota \nPower and the Department shall coordinate to determine what information should be \nincluded in the compliance filings under this provision. Unless, within 30 days after \nsubmission of the co mpliance filing, the Commission issues an Order to Show Cause \nfinding a basis to investigate an objection filed by the Commission or the Department \nproviding evidence of noncompliance with this commitment, the company may pay the \ndividend to Alloy Parent.162 \n287. These new commitments  in Stipulation Paragraphs 1.14 and 1.15  prevent \nthe Partners from receiving  dividends  from the Company unless the capital plan is \nadequately financed in accordance with this commitment.163  These commitments (both \nto provide capital and that the Partners would have to forgo dividends if the commitment \nwere not met) further support the financial health of Minnesota Power and its ability to \nmake the generation, transmission, and distribution investments necessary to meet the \nCarbon Free Standard, subject to the Commission’s role in approving (or rejecting) \nproposed investments and associated cost recovery. As noted earlier, i nvestors in the \npublic markets would not make this kind of commitment, and could purchase ALLETE’s \nstock in great quantities without making any commitments to the Company or its \ncustomers.164  \n2. Post -Acquisition Capital Structure  \n288. Assuming a holding company restructuring as described in paragraph 298 \nbelow, Minnesota Power shall maintain its capital structure within the range approved by \nthe Commission in the annual capital structure filing, and Minnesota Power will continue \nits efforts to manage its capital structure to the level approved in its most  recent Minnesota \nrate case.165  While the Commission authorizes a utility’s capital structure in annual filings \nand rate cases, this new commitment in Paragraph  1.13 of the Stipulation  requires \nMinnesota Power to maintain its actual capital structure within that authorized range and \nto manage its actual capital structure to align with the approved capital structure in a rate \ncase.  This commitment further supports the financial health of the utility and alignment \nwith Commission direction.  \n289. As a negotiated resolution, and without agreeing to any party’s underlying \nposition on this issue, Minnesota Power’s currently approved Return on Equity (“ROE”) \n \n162 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.5 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n163 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.9 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n164 Ex. MP -13 at 22 (Alley Direct) (eDocket No. 202412 -212968 -10); Evid. Hrg. Tr. at 568:2 -568:16 (April 2, \n2025) (Addonizio).  \n165 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.13 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 22 of 34\n23 will be changed from 9.78 percent to 9.65 percent.166 The change in ROE will take effect \nthe first full month after both of the following have occurred: (i) the close of the Acquisition \nand (ii) when the order of the Commission becomes final. The 9.65 percent ROE will \nremain in effect until Minnesota Power fi les its next rate case and will be used to set \ninterim rates in Minnesota Power’s next Minnesota rate case. Nothing in this settlement \nstipulation shall be considered a commitment (i) to any specific ROE in the company’s \nnext rate case or (ii) to use a spe cific methodology to determine the ROE in the company’s \nnext rate case.167 Reducing Minnesota Power’s authorized  ROE from 9.78% to 9.65% will \ndeliver tangible financial benefits to customers  and increases the Partners’ financial \ncontributions.  The Company’s ROE would likely otherwise remain 9.78% not only until it \nfiled its next rate case, but until the final rates take effect in the next rate case given that \nMinnesota Statutes generally req uire, absent exigent circumstances, a utility to use the \napproved ROE from its most recent rate case to set interim rates in a subsequent case.168  \nAs such, this new commitment in Paragraph 1.14 provide s real cost benefits to customers \nuntil the next rate case , which is consistent with the public interest . \n3. Corporate Separateness/Ring -Fencing  \n290. Paragraph 1.17 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new commitment \nstating that: t he Partners will not pledge the assets of ALLETE or Minnesota Power to \nsecure debt of the Partners.169 \n291. Paragraph 1.18 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new commitment \nstating that: ALLETE and the Alloy Parent entities shall (to the extent applicable): (a) \nmaintain separate books and records, (b) agree to prohibitions against loans or pledges \nof assets of ALLETE without regulatory approval by the Minnesota Public Utilities \nCommission as stated elsewhere herein, and (c) hold ALLETE harmless from any \nbusiness and financial risk exposures associated with the Alloy Parent entities or its \nsubsidiaries or affili ates (other than any subsidiary or division of ALLETE).170 \n292. Paragraph 1.19 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new commitment \nstating that: (a) Neither ALLETE nor the Alloy Parent entities shall provide direct credit \nsupport to a credit facility of the other through a guarantee, and (b) none of ALLETE’s \ncredit facilities shall include any cross -default provision whereby a default under any of \nthe Alloy Parent entities’ credit facilities would cause a default under any of ALLETE’s \ncredit facilities.171 \n293. Paragraph 1.20 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new commitment \nstating that: ALLETE shall obtain and file a non -consolidation opinion with the \n \n166 This includes Minnesota Power’s commitment not to seek recovery of flotation costs but extends that \ncommitment to the closing of the Acquisition rather than waiting until implementation with the next rate \ncase.  \n167 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.14 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n168 Minn.

Paragraph 1.22 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new commitment \nstating that: Minnesota Power shall be prohibited from guaranteeing any obligations of its \nnonutility affiliates.173 \n295. These commitments further the ring -fencing commitments made by the \nPartners  and the Company, described earlier in these Findings . The enhanced ring -\nfencing measures aim to protect Minnesota Power’s financial standing by restricting the \npledging of utility assets, introducing cross -default protections, and mandating a non -\nconsolidation opinion  that  the Department recommended .174 Together, these measures \nattempt to limit Minnesota Power’s exposure to financial distress within upstream entities , \nare consistent with protections afforded in utility and energy company acquisitions,  and \nare consistent with the public interest.  \n4. Governance  \n296. Several new commitments in the Settlement Stipulation  further address the \nobligations of the Board of Directors of ALLETE after the acquisition : \n(a) The Audit Committee of the Board will consist of Board directors not \nemployed by  any of ALLETE, GIP, or CPP Investments.175 \n(b) Members of the Board of ALLETE will have defined fiduciary \nresponsibilities consistent with Minnesota law. No member of the \nBoard of ALLETE shall be permitted to waive any fiduciary duties that \nthey would otherwise owe to ALLETE under Minnesota state law.176 \n(c) Unless necessary to comply with an order from an applicable \nregulatory authority, the definitive governance documentation \nregarding ALLETE shall be consistent with this Settlement \nStipulation between the Department and Petitioners, as approved by \nthe Commi ssion.177 \n297. The commitments in Paragraphs 1.24 to 1.26 of the Settlement Stipulation  \nprovide additional assurance s regarding  the post -Acquisition governance of ALLETE and \nrequir e the governance documentation to align with the Stipulation . Additionally, \nestablishing that the Audit Committee of the Board will consist of directors not employed \nby either the Partners nor Minnesota Power provides another independent layer of \n \n172 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.20 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n173 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.22 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n174 Ex.

Commitments 1.27, 1.28, and 1.42  of the Settlement Stipulation  require \nALLETE to form a new holding company structure, separating the regulated utilities from \nother corporate entities, as follows:  \n(a) Within six months after the close of the Acquisition, Minnesota Power \nwill file a petition with the Commission in a new docket that proposes \nto separate non -regulated utility entities from the current ALLETE \nd/b/a Minnesota Power entity. As part of the sep aration, Superior \nWater Light & Power is expected to remain a subsidiary of Minnesota \nPower. For the avoidance of doubt, the costs associated with the \npetition or separation efforts will not be considered transaction or \ntransition costs of the Acquisition but recoverability will be \ndetermined in the course of the separation proceeding.178 \n(b) Following Commission approval of a holding company for Minnesota \nPower, a majority of the Board and a majority of the Independent \nDirectors must approve any decision to place ALLETE, Inc., \nMinnesota Power, or any subsidiary of Minnesota Power after the \nholding company separation, into voluntary bankruptcy. Petitioners \nwarrant th ey have no plans to place ALLETE, Inc., including the \nMinnesota Power operating division, into voluntary bankruptcy \nduring the pendency of the separation proceeding.179  \n(c) Costs associated with any holding company petition or separation \nefforts will not be considered transaction or transition costs of the \nAcquisition and recovery of same shall be considered in any holding \ncompany docket.180 \n299. Overall, these additional governance commitments  provide additional \nassurance regarding post-Acquisition decision  making  that would affect Minnesota Power \ncustomers , providing multiple layers of governance provisions and additional ring -fencing \nof the regulated utility from non -regulated affiliates . These additional  commitments are \nconsistent with the  public interest.  \n5. Affiliated Interests  \n300. Paragraph 1.30 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new commitment \nstating that: Minnesota Power’s annual affiliate interest report to the Commission will be \n \n178 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.27 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n179 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.28 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). The formation of a \nholding company has been a 5 topic of discussion between Minnesota Power and the Commission for at \nleast fifteen years.  See MP-35 at 3 (Anderson Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -06); DOC -302 at 13 \n(Vavro Surrebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253 -216835 -01). \n180 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.42 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 25 of 34\n26 subject to an annual Agreed Upon Procedures audit by the company’s independent third -\nparty auditors; the costs of such additional audit procedures are not recoverable from \nratepayers. Transactions with affiliated interests must be done at arm’s length. ALLETE \nshall update its purchasing policies, procedures, manuals, codes of conduct, etc. , to \nensure compliance with conditions related to affiliated interests. ALLETE’s compliance \nwith affiliated interest standards and transactions will be subject to regular audits by \nindependent third -party auditors; costs of such audits will not be recovera ble from \nratepayers. Consistent with the foregoing, annual lists of affiliated interests and \ndocumentation on affiliated transactions will be retained as set forth in a retention \nschedule.181  \n301. Independent audits of affiliated transactions helps ensure transparency and \nfairness, protecting customers from any specter of inappropriate cost allocations .  The \nCompany is not currently required to obtain an Agreed Upon Procedures audit, and such \na requirement adds a further layer of affiliated interest protection at no cost to customers.  \n6. Books and Records  \n302. The new commitments in Paragraphs  1.34 to 1.36 of the Settlement \nStipulation  provide:   \n(a) ALLETE and Minnesota Power shall provide access to all documents \nand electronically stored information provided to or by credit rating \nagencies pertaining to ALLETE up to Alloy Parent.182 \n(b) ALLETE and the Alloy Parent entities shall maintain the books and \nrecords necessary to allow for an audit of all corporate, affiliate, or \nsubsidiary transactions with Minnesota Power or that result in costs \nthat may be allocable to Minnesota Power.183 \n(c) ALLETE shall maintain separate books and records between \nALLETE and Alloy Parent and make those available to the \nCommission by request. ALLETE shall also file its own separate \nfinancial statements with the Commission in the form attached to the \nRebuttal Te stimony of Witness Anderson.184 \n303. The Department and other parties will continue receive and have access to \nfull information about Minnesota Power’s utility operations, with many avenues in the \nmultiple Minnesota Power proceedings before the Commission at any given time to \nrequest addition al information. These new commitments pertaining to access to books \nand records do not present potential harm and is consistent with the public interest.    \n \n181 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.30 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n182 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.34 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n183 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.35 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n184 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.36 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 26 of 34\n27 304. The new commitments in Paragraphs 1.32 and 1.39 of the Settlement \nStipulation  address requirements for recording transaction costs, to ensure they are not \nborne by customers:  \n(a) ALLETE shall continue to conform its records to the appropriate \nFERC Uniform System of Accounts pursuant to Minn. R. 7825.0300. \nWithin 90 days of closing, ALLETE shall file the accounting entries \nthat record the Acquisition. This filing shall include the d escription, \namount, and FERC account name and number for each item, \nincluding the actual account entries for the merger -related costs. The \nAlloy Parent entities will account for transaction using the acquisition, \nor purchase, method of accounting for busin ess combinations (as \nopposed to pooling of interests).185 \n(b) ALLETE and the Partners shall not deploy “push down accounting” \n(i.e., adjustment of ALLETE’s regulated asset or liability values or \nbooks and records to reflect the purchase price) with respect to the \nAcquisition.186 \n305. In addition to providing additional means of ensuring Minnesota Power \ncustomers do not bear any costs of the Acquisition, these commitments provide additional \ntransparency for the Commission to confirm that Minnesota Power customers are held \nharmless. Thes e provisions thereby further reduce any risk that costs of the Acquisition \nwill negatively impact customers.  \n7. Rates and Affordability  \n306. Paragraph 1.43 of the Settlement Stipulation  states that: Minnesota Power \nwaives its right to file a rate case before November 1, 2026.187 It has been publicly \ndisclosed that , US Steel, Minnesota Power’s largest single customer, provided a four -\nyear notice that it would terminate its electric service agreement with Minnesota Power.188 \nOn March 20, 2025, Cleveland -Cliffs, Minnesota Power’s second -largest customer, \nannounced that it would idle two mines in Minnesota Power’s service territory, and lay off \nmore than 600 workers.189  The Commission is aware that such changes have historically \ncaused Minnesota Power to file a rate case shortly thereafter.  The Company’s other \nrecent rate case outcomes  suggest the amount could be significant .  While it is not \npossible to specifically pinpoint the dollar value of a rate case that is not filed and litigated, \nwe note that Minnesota Power’s recent approved rate increases in litigated cases \n \n185 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.32 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n186 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.39 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n187 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.43 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n188 Ex.

As such, it is reasonable to conclude that a one -year rate case presents \nconsiderable costs savings for customers.  \n307. Minnesota Power will include a comparison of its requested rate increase \nand the annual rate of inflation in any general rate case, rider filing, or any other \nproceeding that would request an increase to residential customer rates.192  This \ncommitment is beneficial, in that it will provide the Commission, parties to the proceeding, \nand members of the public insight into how the utility is managing expenses compared to \ninflationary pressures.  \n308. Paragraphs 1.45 and 1.46 of the Settlement Stipulation  address ratepayer \ncredits for sales of utility property initially addressed in Docket No. E015/PA -20-675: \n(a) Within 60 days of approval of the Acquisition, Minnesota Power will \nsubmit a plan to the Commission to credit any existing proceeds from \nthe sale of land to ratepayers in the form of a bill credit, as identified \nin Docket No. E015/PA -20-675. The plan will include a proposal to \ncredit proceeds from all remaining hydro land sales as identified in \nDocket No. E015/PA -20-675. As part of its filing, Minnesota Power \nshall propose a reasonable revenue apportionment for consideration \nduring that proceeding.193 \n(b) Within 60 days of closing of any sale of land or other real property \nthat was included in rate base, excluding existing proceeds from land \nsales identified in Docket No. E015/PA -20-675, Minnesota Power \nshall submit a plan to the Commission to credit any fu ture proceeds \nto ratepayers. As part of any such filing, Minnesota Power shall \npropose a reasonable revenue apportionment for consideration \nduring that proceeding.194 \n309. Although Minnesota Power previously agreed to credit the proceeds from \nutility land sales to customers in this Docket, the timing and form of that credit has not \npreviously been addressed or determined.

Workforce and Labor Protections  \n310. Paragraph 1.56 of the Settlement Stipulation  adds a new commitment \nstating that: Minnesota Power will comply with all applicable Minnesota laws under the \njurisdiction of Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (includes prevailing wage, not \nusing debarred contractors, etc.).196 The Commission understands this  commitment to be \na further affirmation of the Company’s obligations to Minnesota workers , which are \nunchanged from pre -Acquisition obligations.   \n9. Environmental & Reliability Commitments  \n311. Paragraph 1.63 of the Settlement Stipulation  requires that Minnesota Power \nshall create a Clean Firm Technology Fund (“Fund”) as follows, using $50 million in funds \nprovided by Alloy Parent that will be accounted for as a regulatory liability.  \na. Alloy Parent shall make $16.67 million installments every two years as part of \nMinnesota Power’s biennial IRP filings, beginning with the pending IRP, Docket \nE015/RP 25 -127, until the $50 million commitment is fulfilled.  \nb. Notwithstanding a Commission order or change in law that pauses, waives, or \nabrogates Minnesota Power’s obligation to make an IRP or successor filing, Alloy \nParent and Minnesota Power shall continue to make biennial contributions to the \nFund. Alloy Pare nt and Minnesota Power shall complete all biennial to the Fund \ntotaling $50 million no later than March 3, 2030.  \nc. The Fund will only be used to finance Minnesota Power investments in clean \nfirm technology approved by the Public Utilities Commission. “Clean firm \ntechnology” means “a carbon -free resource, as defined by Minn. Stat. § \n216B.1691, subd. 1(b), that can be  dispatched and provide energy continuously \nfor a duration of 50 hours or more.” The Settling Parties recognize that new or \nadditional technologies and options may emerge at any time. If Minnesota Power \nidentifies an opportunity that may meet the intent of  the Fund but does not fully \nsatisfy the aforementioned definition, it may propose the opportunity to the \nCommission after conferring with the Department to confirm that the Department \ndoes not object in principle.  \n \n195 See In the Matter of the Petition by Minnesota Power for Approval of Land Sales, Docket No. E015/PA -\n20-675, Compliance Filing at 2 (Oct. 15, 2024) (eDocket No. 202410 -211008 -01).  \n196 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.56 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 29 of 34\n30 d. Neither contributions to the Fund nor the portion of an investment or project \nfinanced with the Fund would be subject to cost recovery (e.g., no return on capital \nor depreciation).197  \n312. This commitment provides multiple benefits:  First, it provides new funding \nspecifically targeted to enabling Minnesota Power to explore newer forms of clean, firm \ntechnology , an evolving area critical to meeting Minnesota’s 2040 Carbon Free Standard.  \nSecond, it provides this funding to Minnesota Power from the Partners, as a result of the \nAcquisition, and therefore does not require contributions from Company ratepayers. \nThird, the results of t his level of investment may displace the need for other investm ents \nthat would be paid by customers, thereby reducing the costs of the clean energy transition \nfor Minnesota Power customers.  Fourth, providing cost -effective, carbon -free, highly \nreliable forms of carbon free energy to customers is beneficial to the env ironment and to \ncustomers, and thereby serves the public interest.  For each of these reasons, we \nconclude the creation of a Partner -funded Clean Firm Technology Fund is a substantial \nbenefit to the public and the public interest.  \n313. Paragraph 1.64 of the Stipulation  sets forth new Safety, Reliability and \nService Quality metrics and commitments, with penalties for noncompliance, and states \nthat: The following metrics are tied to present requirements in Minnesota Power’s annual \nSafety, Reliability, and Service Quality (“SRSQ”) docket. Going forward, changes to \nCommission rules governing service quality or changes to the metrics in the SRSQ docket \nmay also change these metrics, subject to the underperformance payments noted below. \nEach of the following are subject to repo rting starting one year after the close of the \nAcquisition and enforcement beginning two years after the close of the Acquisition:  \na. If Minnesota Power’s statewide service reliability fails to meet or exceed the \nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”) second quartile \nbenchmark for medium utilities, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a \n$250,000 underperforman ce payment.  \nb. If one or more of Minnesota Power’s work centers’ reliability fails to meet or  \nexceed the IEEE second quartile benchmark for small utilities, Minnesota Power \nshall be required to make a $250,000 underperformance payment.  \nc. If the number of non -MN DIP service complaints by Minnesota Power customers \nforwarded to the utility from the Commission's Consumer Affairs Office exceeds \nfifty (50) in a given reporting year, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a \n$250,000 underpe rformance payment.  \nd. If Minnesota Power fails to grant at least 99 percent of Cold Weather Rule \nprotection requests which meet Minnesota statutory requirements, Minnesota \nPower shall be required to make a $250,000 underperformance payment.  \ne. If Minnesota Power fails to restore at least 65 percent of involuntarily \ndisconnected, as defined in the Minnesota Rule 7826.1500, residential customers \n \n197 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.63 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 30 of 34\n31 to service within 24 hours, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a $250,000 \nunderperformance payment.  \nf. If Minnesota Power fails to answer at least 80 percent of customer calls during \nbusiness hours within 20 seconds, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a \n$250,000 underperformance payment.  \ng. If Minnesota Power fails to ensure that at least 99.3 percent of customer invoices \nare accurate, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a $250,000 \nunderperformance payment.  \nh. Fifty percent of any under -performance payments assessed will be applied to \ncustomer bills during the following July billing cycle of a given performance year \non an equal rate per kWh for each customer; the remaining fifty percent will be \nreinvested int o options to address the cause of the underperformance Any bill \ncredit amounts not remitted by the end of the July billing cycle shall accrue interest \nbeginning after the September billing cycle of the applicable year at a rate equal \nto that applied to Min nesota Power’s customer deposits.  \ni. Underperformance payments shall not be recoverable from Minnesota Power  \nratepayers.198 \n314. These r eliability standards both present opportunities to enhance \nMinnesota Power’s service to customers, and to guard against risks of reductions in \nservice quality that intervenors identified in the contested case process. This Stipulation \nprovision also establishes substantial penalties for noncompliance, paid by the Company \nand not customers,  that do not presently exist. Absent this Stipulation and the Acquisition, \nMinnesota Power has not previously agreed to penalties should its service quality decline, \nand historically the Commission has not imposed a penalty structure on a utility absent \nutility agreement.  Accordingly, these provisions provid e  significant customer service and  \noperational benefits  to Minnesota Power’s customers, and align the Acquisition with the \npublic interest by supporting sustainable energy solutions and improved service reliability.   \n \n10. Enforceability   \n315. Paragraphs 1.73 and 1.74  of the Settlement Stipulation  provide several \nadditional enforcement provisions, namely:  \n(a) ALLETE and Partners agree that any failure to achieve any \ncommitment in the Stipulation , or to comply with any other condition \nthe Commission places on approval of the Acquisition, is a violation \nof the Commission’s order under Minn. Stat. § 216B.54 and is \n \n198 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.64 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 31 of 34\n32 enforceable against the entity from whom the action (or non -action) \nis required.199 \n(b) ALLETE and Partners submit to the jurisdiction of the Commission, \nand then of the courts of the State of Minnesota with respect to any \naction brought to enforce or resolve a dispute arising from an \napplicable commitment set forth in this Stipulation  or a Commission \nOrder adopting this Stipulation .200  \n316. The Partners and the Company have previously agreed that their \ncommitments in this proceeding may be memorialized in a Commission order, and the \nadditional enforcement provisions in the Settlement Stipulation  memorialize that such an \nOrder is binding on the parties making the commitments, and that failure to fulfill these \ncommitments is actionable at law – both before the Commission and in the Courts of the \nState of Minnesota.201  Further, it is helpful that the Petitioners expressly acknowledge \nthe authority of the Commission  and of the regulatory construct in Minnesota, as \npreviously discussed in these findings and conclusions.  \n \nDD. Overall Conclusions  \n317. The ALJ raised several concerns in Section III.C of the ALJ Report \nregarding the sufficiency and enforceability of the proposed commitments associated with \nthe Acquisition. However, the  ALJ did not deeply discuss the  Petitioners’ proposed \ncommitments based on the complete evidence in the record, as most of the discussion of \nindividual commitments stated the ALJ’s conclusions as written by opposing parties, \nwithout citations to the record or a balancing of consideratio ns. Additionally, the ALJ did \nnot have the opportunity to thoroughly evaluate modified and new commitments agreed \nto in the Stipulation .  \n318. Collectively , the commitments and protections  present significant benefits \nto Minnesota Power and its customers , substantially mitigate identified risks as discussed \nherein,  and align with the public interest.   \n319. Specifically, the structured equity financing commitments guarantee \nMinnesota Power’s access to necessary capital, mitigating financial risks and providing \nfinancial certainty beyond what is available through the public markets. Enhanced \ntransparency measu res, financial protections, ring -fencing commitments, and \n \n199 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.73 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n200 Settlement Stipulation  at 1.74 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n201 See Minn. Stat. §216B.54. (“Whenever the commission or department shall be of the opinion that any \nperson or public utility is failing or omitting or is about to fail or omit to do anything required of it … by any \norder of the commission, or is doing anything  or about to do anything, or permitting anything or about to \npermit anything to be done, contrary to or in violation of … any order of the commission, it shall refer the \nmatter to the attorney general who shall take appropriate legal action.) (emphasis add ed). “Person” is \ndefined in Minn. Stat. § 216B.02, subd. 3 and includes partnerships and corporations, including the Partners \nand Alloy Parent. Minn. Stat. § 216B.57 also provides that any person, as defined, who knowingly and \nintentionally violates or fai ls to obey a Commission order is subject to financial penalties.  \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 32 of 34\n33 governance structures help ensure  continued financial integrity, robust corporate \nseparateness, and independent oversight.  \n320. While opposing parties have identified potential increases in rates for \ncustomers, including increased cost of capital, as a cost risk of the Acquisition, the \nCommission ultimately determines what investments, rates, and rates of return are just \nand reason able for Minnesota customers. The Stipulation also provides multiple \ncommitments and accounting requirements, described  herein, to ensure the costs of the \nAcquisition itself are not borne by customers.   \n321. There are, however, multiple conditions in the Stipulation  that provide new, \nsignificant, and quantifiable financial benefits to customers, including the Clean Firm \nTechnology Fund, ROE reduction, residential customer arrearage forgiveness, savings \nwith respect to investor relations, flotation, and board of direct ors expenses.  \n322. In Finding #  180 of the ALJ Report, the ALJ concluded that ratepayer \nfinancial benefits in this transaction do not reasonably equate to  “ratepayer concessions \noffered in other recently approved deals. These benefits have included:  \n• $88–100 million in rate credits over ten years, In re Joint Appl. of \nPuget Holdings LLC & Puget Sound Energy, Inc., No. 08, 2008 WL \n5432243 (Dec. 30, 2008);  \n• $75 million in customer benefits, including $60 million as direct rate \ncredits, In re Merger of S. Jersey Indus., Inc. & Boardwalk Merger \nSub, Inc., No. GM22040270, 2023 WL 1965663, at *19 (Jan. 25, \n2023); and  \n• $21 million in rate credits, In re Joint Report & Appl. of El Paso Elec. \nCo., Sun Jupiter Holdings LLC, & IIF U.S. Holding 2 L.P., No. 49849, \n2020 WL 707291, at *8 (Jan. 28, 2020). ” \n323. However, taking together the $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund; the \nlikely values of  a rate case stay out  and ROE reduction ;202 the $ 2.5 million  value of \nreduced customer costs associated with flotation costs, investor relations costs, and \nboard of directors costs; and between $1 .5 million and $3.5 million in arrearage \nforgiveness; along with the extension of collective bargaining agreements with wage \nincreases  for union employees , the expedited return of land sales funds to customers, \nand the potential for penalties paid by the Company if service quality metrics are not met, \nconservatively the financial commitments in the Stipulation  are on par with – if not \nsubstantially exceeding – the financial benefits of the Puget Sound, S. Jersey Industries, \nand El Paso Electric mergers and acquisitions identified in the ALJ Report.  \n \n202  In the Matter of Application by Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in \nMinnesota Docket No. E015/GR -23-155, Compliance Filing at Section 1 page 1 (Dec. 20, 2024 ); In the \nMatter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Utility Service in \nMinnesota, Docket No. E015/GR -21-355, Compliance Filing at Attachment 1 page 1 (Oct. 5, 2023).  \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 33 of 34\n34 324. Additionally, provisions addressing affiliated interest transparency, \nprotections against transaction -related cost recovery, dedicated support for low -income \ncustomers, and substantial environmental and reliability commitments further illustrate \nnet public benefits.  \n325. Therefore, based on the extensive and detailed commitments as modified \nby the  Settlement Stipulation , the Commission finds that  the proposed Acquisition is \nconsistent with  the public interest. The comprehensive nature and enforceability of these \ncommitments justify approval of the Acquisi tion, as they mitigate identified risks while  \ncreat ing meaningful and measurable benefits for Minnesota Power, its customers, and \nthe broader community.  \n \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment B\nPage 34 of 34"

Has the proposed Settlement addressed the questions addressed to the \nAdministrative Law Judge in the Commission’s Order of October 7, 2024?  \n3.

Are there other issues or concerns related to this matter?  \nPer its responses to these questions, and f or the reasons described herein, LPI respectfully urges \nthe Commission to deny the proposed settlement in its entirety. \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \n On Friday afternoon, July 11, 2025, two business days prior to the  anticipated  issuance of \nthe Administrative Law Judge’s (“ALJ”) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and \nRecommendations (“ALJ Findings”)  in this proceeding , the Department of Commerce \n(“Department”), Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investments, and Global Infrastructure Partners (together, “the Partners”), jointly filed (as the “Settling Parties”) a proposed settlement \nstipulation (“Settlement”), in the above -captioned docket.  The Settlement purports to offer “a \nseries of additional commitments resp onsive to issues and concerns raised by the Department that \nensure that the Acquisition is consistent with the public interest.”\n2  LPI is troubled by this \ncharacterization, and the corresponding social media efforts by the Partners to advance the \n \n2  Settlement Stipulation Between the Minnesota Department of Commerce, ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a \nMinnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Global Infrastructure Partners at 2  (Jul. 11, \n2025) (eDocket No. 20257- 220879-01) (“Settlement Stipulation”) .  \n \n3 \n Settlement , which are simply  more statements that are entirely inconsistent with the record , that \nthe Commission should disregard.3   \nTo be sure , the record developed over the course of a year demonstrates that  the proposed \nSettlement includes little, if any, incremental benefit to the list of commitments the Partners agreed \nto over the course of the proceeding and included in the Partners’ proposed findings submitted to \nthe ALJ .  These commitments were not persuasive to six of the Parties then, and five of the \nIntervenors now .  Nor were they persuasive to the ALJ, which the ALJ addressed  in detail in the \nALJ Findings.  T he Settlement is , in fact, s ubstantively and legally flawed by largely restating \nCommitments rejected in the 283 Findings of Fact that the ALJ made after a year of record \ndevelopment and evidentiary proceedings that concluded the proposed Acquisition is not in the public interest.  Furthermore, the Settlement is procedurally flawed, especially considering that the Settling Parties refused to respond to LPI’s requests for information regarding its benefits.  Even \nif the Commission sees some benefit to the Settlement the likes of which LPI does not, no record \nexists upon which the Settlement could be approved.  The Commission should therefore deny it \nand the proposed Acquisition, and require Minnesota Power to provide an accounting of the cost \nincurred pursuing the transaction.   \n \n3  See, e.g., ALJ Findings  (Public)  at 38, P 180, n.339 (“At various times throughout this proceeding, \nMinnesota Power has insisted that the Petitioner’s “intent” or “understanding” is different than what is \nreflect in the written documents.  This is one such example.  Minnesota Power’s apparent reliance on \nunenforceable “understandings” which conflict with the written record is, at best, naïve.  Sophisticated \nparties, like the Partners, engaging in complex transactions, like the Acquisition, rely on written \nagreements.  The Commission should do the same. ”) (emphasis added)  \n \n4 \n II.  ANALYSIS  \nA. The Settlement as Proposed is Not Consistent with the Public Interest . \nMinnesota Statute § 216B.50 requires Commission authorization for any public utility to \n“sell, acquire, lease, or rent any plant as an operating unit or system in this state for a total \nconsideration in excess of $1,000,000, or merge or consolidate with another public utility or \ntransmission company operating in this state.”  As noted by the ALJ, the longstanding requirement \nto obtain this approval is for the petitioners  to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \nthe proposed transaction “is consistent with the Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 public interest standard.”4  \nFurther, if the Commission finds the proposed action consistent with the public interest, § 216B.50 \nrequires “it shall give its consent and approval ….”   In applying that standard, the Commission has \nsought evidence of tangible benefits to ratepayers.5  While the Partners advocate for a lower \nstandard, the ALJ correctly concludes , in recommending rejection of the Proposed Acquisition:  \nThe parties have argued that the public interest requires the  \nCommission find that the deal either produces net benefits or, \nalternatively, avoids net  harm. The proposed deal is inconsistent \nwith the public interest under either standard because it results in net \nharm to the public interest.6 \nTherefore, LPI review s the marginal additional commitments offered in the Settlement \nthrough the same lens – that is, regardless of the interpretation of how to satisfy the public interest \n \n4  ALJ’s  Findings  and Recommendations  (Public), at 60, P 11. (citing Minn. Stat. § 216B.50; Minn. \nR. 1400.7399 subp. 5).  \n5  E.g., In the Matter of Otter Tail Power Company’s Petition for Approval of a Transfer of Property, \nMPUC Docket No. E -017/PA -21-793, Order Approving Petition and Requiring Compliance Filing at 3- 4 \n(Oct. 24, 2022); In the Matter of Proposed Merger of Minnegasco, Inc. with and into Arkla, Inc. , MPUC \nDocket No. G-008/PA -90-604, Order Approving Merger and Adopting Amended Stipulation with \nModifications at 4 (Nov. 27, 1990); In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Company \nfor Approval to Merge with New Century Energies, Inc. , MPUC Docket No. E, G-002/PA -99-1031, Order \nApproving Merger, As Conditioned at 11 -12 (Jun. 12, 2000).  \n6  ALJ’s  Findings  and Recommendations  (Public)  at 61, P 15 (citing Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 subd. 1).  \n \n5 \n standard under Minnesota law, whether the Settlement meets even the low bar of eliminating harm \nto the public interest.  For reasons further explained below, the Settlement does not offset the harms of the Proposed Acquisition or  offer anything not already required by Minnesota law.   \nAdditionally, the Settlement fails to explicitly address the questions addressed to the Administrative Law Judge in the Commission’s Order of October 7, 2024, in this docket. \nB. The Conditions Proposed in the Settlement are Repetitive of Those Rejected in the \nALJ Findings, Inadequate to Offset Harms Associated with the Proposed Acquisition, and Fail to Offer Material Benefits to Ratepayers . \nThe Settlement offers only incremental changes from the Partners’ initial offer and overall \nlittle value to ratepayers.  The Department claims the  Settlement includes “more than 70 discrete \nterms” and is “broadly responsive to concerns identified by the Department during the contested -\ncase proceeding .”\n7  Footnote 3 of the Settlement includes a list of terms that “were negotiated by \nthe Settling Parties for purposes of this comprehensive Settlement Stipulation.”8  The footnote \nconcedes that  the remaining terms constitute those already offered in the course of testimony.   In \nother words, despite claiming “more than 70 discrete terms” benefiting ratepayers were included \nin the S ettlement, more than 30 of those terms were agreed to by the Partners and offered for the \nALJ’s consideration.  Additionally, the Settlement does not account for the fact that the terms not \ndescribed in footnote 3 (i.e., the more than 30 terms agreed to by the Partners), have all be \nsystematically critique d or rejected in the ALJ Findings as insufficient, already required by law, \n \n7  Letter at 1 (Jul. 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257-220879-02).  \n8  Settlement Stipulation at 2, n.3.  \n \n6 \n or offering no benefits to ratepayers.9  Overall, the terms in footnote 3 fail to  provide sufficient \nbenefits to outweigh the ALJ-identified harms of the Proposed Acquisition.  \nPursuant to the Settlement Stipulation, the only incremental differences from previous \nofferings are settlement terms: 1.4- 1.6, 1.9, 1.12- 1.14, 1.17- 1.30, 1.32- 1.36, 1.38, 1.40- 1.46, 1.56, \n1.63- 1.64, and 1.73- 1.74.10  As noted in the table  below, each “new” or “modified” term remains \neither insufficient, already required by law, or provides no benefit to ratepayers.  \nSettlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.4 Alloy Parent has already committed to provide this type of equity financing \nas part of the Proposed Acquisition.  Adding that dividends will not be paid \nout until such equity financing materializes does not change the \nfundamental commitment and offers nothing new to ratepayers.11 \n1.5 The Settlement term is not materially different from what the Company \nalready committed to, stating “[t] he Company will provide compliance \nfilings on equity infusions from and dividends to Alloy Parent in the same \nmanner in which the Company currently provides compliance filings in its capital structure docket. ”\n12 \n1.6 This Settlement commitment matches identically what was offered in the \nJoint Proposed Findings, which stated “ The Company commits to not make \nany dividend or distributions unless at least  one senior unsecured credit \nrating is investment grade or above. ”13 \n \n9  See LPI Exceptions to the ALJ’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations  \n(Aug. 4, 2025).  \n10  Settlement Stipulation at 2, n.3.  \n11  Joint Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation to Approve the \nAcquisition at Attachment A, pg. 1 of 11 (Commitment 1)  (May 29, 2025) (eDocket No. 2255-219382-02)  \n(“Joint Proposed Findings”).  \n12  Joint Proposed Findings at 81 (May 29, 2025) (citing Ex. MP -35 at 13-14 (Anderson Rebuttal)).  \n13  Joint Proposed Findings at Attachment A, pg. 1 of 11 ( Commitment 4 ). \n \n7 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.9 This Settlement commitment matches identically to what was already \noffered in the Proposed Joint Findings, that “ ALLETE will not make any \ndividend or distribution that would cause the actual  equity ratio of \nMinnesota Power to be outside the range approved by the  Commission.”14 \n1.12 Minnesota Power has already committed that “ Minnesota Power and the \nPartners have committed that if, as a result of the Acquisition, Minnesota \nPower’s cost of debt increases above current levels within three years \nfollowing the close of the Acquisition, customers will be held harmless \nfrom any rate impact. ”15  Adding two years to the commitment (i.e., bring \nit to five years following the close of the Acquisition), hardly constitutes a \nmaterial or new benefit.  \n1.13 This Settlement commitment matches identically to Commitment 37 in the \nProposed Joint Findings.16 \n1.14 The commitment to lower Minnesota Power’s return on equity (“ROE”) to \n9.65 percent until it is next eligible for a rate case, effective the first full month after the close of the Acquisition and issuance a final Commission order, provides very little reli ef to ratepayers.  \nConsidering a final \nCommission order is not expected until the first quarter of 2026, and \nMinnesota Power will become eligible for a rate case in November 2026 (per term 1.43), this commitment offers at most 10 months of benefits to ratepayers.  \n1.17 Minnesota Power and the Partners have already agreed to prohibitions on \nloans or pledges of assets of ALLETE without regulatory approval.17 \n \n14  Joint Proposed Findings at Attachment A, pg. 1 of 11 ( Commitment 3 ). \n15  Joint Proposed Findings at 43 (citing Ex. MP -29 at 22 (Taran Rebuttal), Ex. MP-33 at 34-35 (Bram \nRebuttal)).  \n16  Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 6 of 11 ( Commitment 37 ). \n17  Proposed Joint Findings at 45.  \n \n8 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.18 The Petitioners have already committed to, verbatim, “ maintain separate \nbooks and records, agree to prohibitions against loans or pledges of assets \nof ALLETE without regulatory approval, and generally hold ALLETE \nharmless from any business and financial risk exposures associated with \nAlloy Parent or its subsi diaries or affiliates (other than any subsidiary of \nALLETE) .”18  \n1.19 The Petitioners have already made this commitment verbatim: “ Neither \nALLETE nor Alloy Parent shall provide direct credit support to a credit \nfacility of the other through a guarantee, and none of ALLETE’s credit \nfacilities shall include any cross -default provision whereby a default under \nany of Alloy Parent’s credit  facilities would cause a default under any of \nALLETE’s credit facilities [.]”19 \n1.20 While this term represents a new commitment, it is industry -standard to \nprovide a non- consolidation opinion in the merger or acquisition of a public \nutility.20  \n1.21 Minnesota Power and the Partners have already committed that “ Minnesota \nPower will be prohibited from loaning funds to or borrowing funds from  its \nAlloy parent or other upstream entities.”21 \n1.22 Minnesota Power and the Partners have already committed that “ Alloy \nParent will not use utility assets to guarantee Alloy Parent debt. ” The \nalteration of the commitment such that Minnesota Power is prohibited from \nguaranteeing any obligations of its nonutility affiliates represents an \nincremental benefit to ratepayers at best.  \n \n18  Proposed Joint Findings at 45.  \n19  Proposed Joint Findings at 45.  \n20  E.g., In the Matter of the Joint Application of Puget Holdings LLC and Puget Sound Energy, INC., \nFor an Order Authorizing Proposed Transaction, Docket U072375, Order 08 Approving and Adopting \nSettlement Stipulation; Authorizing Transaction Subject to Conditions at 154 (December 30, 2008).  \n21  Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 2 of 11  (Commitment 10) .  \n \n9 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.23 The governance commitment presented in the Settlement materially \nconforms to what is presented in the Proposed Joint Findings, save the \naddition of a single board member.  Furthermore, the addition of a single board member does not change the fact that the  Partners as a whole will \nselect a majority of the board seats (10 of 14).\n22  Nor does the commitment \nin 1.23 (a) eliminate the ability of this Partner- selected board from \ninfluencing, modifying, or rejecting any of the budgets, proposals, strategic plans, or regulatory filings “developed” by Minnesota Power.  \n1.24 While the commitment that “[t] he Audit Committee of the Board will \nconsist of Board directors not employed by any of ALLETE, GIP, or CPP \nInvestments ” represents a new commitment and provides some benefits to \nratepayers in terms of transparency and control, it is not substantial enough \nto uproot a finding that the Proposed Acquisition is not in the public \ninterest.  \n1.25 This commitment is already required by Minnesota Law, as the term itself \nstates.  A benefit to ratepayers cannot exist where an action would be \nrequired of Minnesota Power and the Partners with or without the \ncommitment.  \n1.26 This commitment does not offer a benefit to ratepayers.  It simply states \nwhich document  will serve as definitive governance documentation.  \n1.27 Minnesota Power and the Partners’ commitment to separate non -regulated \nutility entities from the current ALLETE d/b/a Minnesota Power entity \nupon the Acquisition’s closing may offer some benefits to ratepayers, but would also be subject to recoverability, this leaving ratepayers with rate increases that they would not have to endure but -\nfor the Proposed \nAcquisition.23 \n1.28 This commitment does not assuage concerns about control of Minnesota \nPower given a majority of the board will be comprised of directors selected by the Partners.  \n \n22  See Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 2 of 11 (Commitment Commitments 11 -14).  \n23  Settlement at 6 (“the costs associated with the petition or separation efforts will not be considered \ntransaction or transition costs of the Acquisition but recoverability will be determined in the course of the \nseparation proceeding.” ). \n \n10 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.29 Minnesota Power has already committed to these exact requirements, \nexcept now it will identify contracts over $500,000 (rather than $1 million) \nwith an entity identified pursuant to the immediately preceding \ncommitment and notify the Commission within 30 d ays of contract \nexecution.  The lowering of the amount by $500,000 provides no material \nbenefit to ratepayers, as is certainly not significant enough to offset the \nProposed Acquisition’s potential harms.  \n1.30 While the commitment to subject Minnesota Power’s annual affiliate \ninterest report to an annual Agreed Upon Procedures audit by independent third -\nparty auditors is new, it represents a simple modification to an \nunderlying commitment, and does not provide e nough of a ratepayer \nbenefit to offset potential harms.  \n1.32 ALLETE is  already  required to keep its books in accordance with the \nCommission’s Uniform System of Accounts.24  This commitment proposes \nnothing beyond what is already required by FERC.  \n1.33 This Commitment has already been offered verbatim in the Proposed Joint \nFindings.25 \n1.34 While this commitment goes a step beyond one already offered, that \n“Minnesota Power will continue to provide ALLETE credit rating reports to the Commission within 30 days of receipt of the reports from the rating agencies[,]” it does not substantially help \noutweigh the Proposed \nAcquisition’s potential harms.  \n1.35 Because ALLETE and Alloy Parent entities are already subject to audit, \nand thus must already maintain their books  and records in a form that can \ndistinguish costs allocable to Minnesota Power, this commitment does not constitute an explicit new benefit for ratepayers.  \n \n24  ALLETE, Inc., On Behalf of Itself and Its Public Utility Subsidiaries, Docket No. EC24-105, \nApplication for Authorization under Section 203 of the FPA of ALLETE, Inc. at Attachment 2 (Jul. 19, \n2024).  \n25  Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 6 of 11 (“Partners commit to providing the \nDepartment and Commission with access to all books and records of the entities up to and including Alloy Parent that are related to Minnesota Power's operations under the jurisdiction of the Commission.” \n(Commitment 42 ).  \n \n11 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.36 This commitment is at best an incremental addition to the commitment \nalready made by Minnesota Power and the Partners to provide “[a] ccess to \nthe books and records of the entities up to and including Alloy Parent that \nare related to Minnesota Power’s operations under the jurisdiction of the Commission will be provided to the Commission after the Acquisition .”\n26 \n1.38 This commitment is at best an incremental addition to the commitment \nalready made by Minnesota Power and the Partners that “[t] he Company’s \nannual capital structure petition will include full audited consolidated \nfinancial statements for ALLETE, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Principles (“GAAP”).  \nThese will include all of the \nfootnotes, as well as specific supplemental schedules that are currently \nincluded in ALLETE’s Forms 10- K and 10- Q.”27 \n1.40 This term has repeatedly been offered as a commitment throughout this \nproceeding (i.e., not to recover Acquisition, transaction, transition costs, or an acquisition premium, from customers).\n28 \n1.41 This commitment identically matches one offered prior to the Settlement.29 \n1.42 This commitment does not represent a real benefit to customers.  But-for \nthe Proposed Acquisition, ratepayers would not be subject to or responsible for costs associated with the formation of a Holding Company, and thus ratepayers should not be forced to bear those costs. \n1.43 The commitment for Minnesota Power to waive its right to file a rate case \nbefore November 1, 2026 does not offer substantive relief to ratepayers.  \nBy the time these commitments will become effective (i.e., upon \nCommission Order authorizing the proposed Acquisition), it would be early 2026, and this commitment would provide at most 10 months of relief.  \n \n26  Proposed Joint Findings at 81 (citing Ex. MP -35 at 14 (Anderson Rebuttal)).  \n27  Proposed Joint Findings at 81 (citing Ex. MP -35 at 13 -14 (Anderson Rebuttal)).  \n28  E.g., Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 3 of 11  (Commitments 17, 18) . \n29  Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 4 of 11  (Commitment 27 ). \n \n12 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.44 While this commitment may provide slight transparency, it is not \nsomething ratepayers could not already request in the course of a typical \nrate case.  As such, the commitment does not provide much benefit to \nratepayers.  \n1.45 Minnesota Power is already crediting  “the difference between the book \nvalue and the sale price to Minnesota Power customer s.”30  Committing to \nprovide a plan for continuing to do so within 60 days of the Acquisition’s approval makes no guarantees as to when ratepayers would actually see \nthose credits.  Without more certainty, this commitment does not materially \nbenefit ratepayers.  \n1.46 Issues with this commitment mirror those with 1.45.  The commitment \nmakes no guarantee as to when ratepayers would actually see these credits.  \n1.56 This commitment is required by law.  Minnesota Power does not confer on \nratepayers an explicit benefit when it complies with Minnesota law.  \n1.63 If the Partners can commit $50 million in funds to a “Clean Firm \nTechnology Fund,” they should also provide a standalone rate credit to \nratepayers.  \n1.64 The utility is already required to comply with the listed service quality \nreporting requirements.  The offering of an underperformance payment \ndoes not quell the concerns of ratepayers regarding the effects the Proposed Acquisition may have on service quality.  Once again, Minnesota Power \noffers as a commitment something it is required by the Commission to do anyway.  \n1.73 This commitment is simply a fact.  It does not constitute a benefit to \nratepayers.   \n1.74 Like term 1.73, this commitment simply describes the jurisdiction of the \nCommission and subsequent appeal process, and does not constitute a \nbenefit to ratepayers.  \n \n \n30  In the Matter of the Petition for Approval of Minnesota Power Land Sales , Docket No. E015/PA -\n20-675, Petition for Approval at 9 (Aug. 31, 2020).  \n \n13 \n Among all the new terms offered, only three provide any  material relief to ratepayers, relief \nwhich is nominal at best: the creation of the Clean Firm Technology Fund, which will provide $50 \nmillion in funds toward Minnesota Power’s integrated resource plan dockets;31 a reduction in \nMinnesota Power’s authorized ROE from 9.78% to 9.65%; and a commitment not to file a rate case before November 1, 2026.\n32  These three commitments are entirely insufficient to overcome \nthe net harm resulting from the Proposed Acquisition. \nWith respect to the Clean Firm Technology Fund, LPI emphasizes that the $50 million \npledge is neither immediate nor indicative of a ratepayer benefit.  To be sure, the pledge is over a period of at least four years because the amounts are paid in instalments.\n33  Furthermore, the \ncommitment to not seek cost recovery may not be a commitment at all and instead could simply be a commitment by the Partners to seek cost recovery from federal or state sources.\n34  Had \nMinnesota Power and the Partners been interested in putting their own money towards benefiting ratepayers, they could have done so via a rate credit proposal, which is a common commitment for \nproceedings such as the Proposed Acquisition.\n35  And t he latter commitments do not amount to a \n \n31  Settlement Stipulation at 11 (see term 1.63).  \n32  Settlement Stipulation at 9 (see term 1.43). \n33  Settlement Stipulation at 11-12 (see term 1.43).  \n34  As the Commission is well -aware, the U.S. Department of Energy is working to disperse federal \nfunding for clean energy infrastructure, which the Minnesota Department of Commerce is working to \nimplement.  See https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/clean -energy-infrastructure-funding- projects-and -\nprograms ; https://mn.gov/commerce/energy/industry- government/federal -funding-opportunities/ .  \n35  See, In the Matter of the Joint Application of Puget Holdings LLC and Puget Sound Energy, INC., \nFor an Order Authorizing Proposed Transaction, Docket U-072375, Order 08 Approving and Adopting \nSettlement Stipulation; Authorizing Transaction Subject to Conditions at P 93 (December 30, 2008) (committing to rate credit totaling $100 million). \n \n14 \n rate credit.  These commitments will not become effective until a final order has been issued by \nthe Commission, effectively capping the impacts of any perceived benefits to around 10 months.36   \nTaken together, the new commitments provided in the Settlement are insufficient to \noutweigh the tremendous potential harms that accompany the Proposed Acquisition.  Additionally, \nthe ALJ Findings noted the settlement did not assuage the ALJ’s concerns about the Proposed \nAcquisition and did not change her ultimate recommendation: that the MPUC “disapprove the \nAcquisition.”37  The Settlement Stipulation provides only slight deviations to the commitments \nproposed throughout the proceeding, which time and time again have proven unsatisfactory to \noffset the potential harms of the Proposed Acquisition.  Therefore , LPI cannot support the \nSettlement.  \nC. Other Issues or Concerns – Settling Parties’ Refusal to Engage with LPI Discovery \nOnly Exacerbates Its Transparency Concerns. \nUpon receipt of the Settlement, LPI had reasonable and material questions related to the  \nSettlement’s terms, the Department’s analysis to substantiate ALLETE’s claimed need for a “$5 \nbillion capital plan,” modeling around the estimated benefit to ratepayers from the Clean Firm \nTechnology Fund, and other questions.38  Citing a discovery deadline contained in one of the ALJ’s \nprehearing orders, t he Settling Parties refused to engage and were not  willing to respond to basic \ndiscovery to ease concerns around how the procedural posture of the Settlement, or  what it offered \n \n36  Settlement Stipulation at 4 (see terms 1.14, 1.43) (estimating that a Commission final order will \nnot be produced until early 2026).  \n37  ALJ’s  Findings  and Recommendations  at 73.  \n38  Appendix A contains the information requests issued by LPI.  \n \n15 \n distinct from existing commitments that had been previously unacceptable to the Department.39    \nThe Department’s and Partner’s position is extremely disappointing.  The discovery deadline was \nset at the beginning of the contested case process, as a common practice to limit discovery and distraction during the evidentiary hearings.  None of the part ies anticipated the production of new \ninformation, let alone a proposed settlement on the eve of ALJ Findings, well after the conclusion of the evidentiary hearings.  Parties should not be precluded from asking questions related to a new, substantive document introduced after evidentiary hearings have concluded.  The Partners \nbear the burden of proof in this proceeding.  By not responding, the Partners are underscoring their \ninability to meet this burden.  Furthermore, the Partners’ refusal to engage with L PI regarding its \nquestions only perpetuates the litigious and untransparent practices the Partners exhibited during the proceeding and exacerbates LPI’s concerns around transparency and the willingness of the \nPartners to work with Minnesota Power customers moving forward.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons provided herein above, t he Settlement is procedurally and legally flawed \nand fails to rescue the Proposed Acquisition from being entirely inconsistent with the public \ninterest.  Absent the Partners coming forward with material ratepayer protections, LPI cannot support the Settlement.  As drafted,  the Settlement does not comport with the public interest  and \nshould be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n39  Included as Appendix B is the Department’s letter declining to respond to LPI’s information \nrequests.  Included as Appendix C is Minnesota Power’s letter declining to response to LPI’s information \nrequests.   \n \n16 \n Dated:  August 4, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \n \n STOEL RIVES LLP  \n /s/ Andrew P.

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS \n50. Comments on the proposed Acquisition were gathered during in-person and \nvirtual public hearings as well as through written comments during the public comment \nperiod, which closed on April 17, 2025. Due to the volume of comments, a summary of \npublic comments is attached as Addendum A . \nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n51. The proposed Acquisition is governed by Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, which \nrequires Commission approval before a public utility may “sell, acquire, lease, or rent any \nplant as an operating unit or system in this state for a total consideration in excess of \n$1,000,000, or merge or consolidate with another public utility or transmission company \noperating in this state.” Under this statute, the Commission must assess whether the \nAcquisition is “consistent with the public interest.”58 If the Commission finds that the \nAcquisition is consistent with the public interest, “it shall give its consent and approval by \norder in writing.”59 \n52. To determine if the Acquisition is “consistent with the public interest, \nperceived detriments or concerns must be weighed against perceived benefits to the \n \n57 Exs. MP-60 (Cady Response Testimony) (eDocket No. 20254-217895-01 ); MP-61 (Cady Response \nTestimony HCTS) (eDocket No. 20254-217896-02 ); CPPIB-GIP-206 (Bram Response Testimony) \n(eDocket No. 20254-217895-02 ); CPPIB-GIP-207 (Bram Response Testimony HCTS) (eDocket \nNo. 20254-217896-03 ). \n58 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd. 1. \n59 Id. \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 13 of 97\n \n \n11 \n public. If the perceived detriments do not outweigh the perceived benefits, the merger is \ndeemed to be ‘consistent with the public interest.’”60 \n53. Although the Commission uses a balancing test to determine if the \nAcquisition is consistent with the public interest,61 a finding that the Acquisition results in \nnet benefits is not required. Rather, in prior cases, the Commission has consistently held \nthat the public interest standard requires only a finding that a transaction is compatible \nwith the public interest, not an affirmative finding of public benefit.62 The Commission has \nalso stated that Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 “does not require that proposed mergers \naffirmatively benefit ratepayers or the public or that they otherwise promote the public \ninterest.”63 To satisfy this standard, the Acquisition merely “cannot contravene the public \ninterest . . . and must be shown to be compatible with it.”64 \n54. LPI, CURE, and Sierra Club argue that the Commission should apply a net \nbenefit standard when evaluating the proposed Acquisition. LPI argues that some other \nstate commissions and this Commission have favored a demonstration of net benefits, \nand a net benefits standard should apply to the proposed Acquisition based on the \n \n60 In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Company for Approval to Merge with New \nCentury Energies, Inc. , Docket No. E,G002/PA-99-1031, O RDER APPROVING MERGER , AS CONDITIONED  at 7 \n(June 12, 2000) (“NSP/NCE Merger Order”) (eDocket No. 789046 ). \n61 In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Acquisition by MDU Resources Group, Inc., and its Division, \nGreat Plains Natural Gas Company, of Cascade Natural Gas Corporation , Docket No. G004/PA-06-1585, \nORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION , WITH CONDITIONS  at 2 (Mar. 23, 2007) (eDocket No. 3943867 ). \n62 See, e.g., id. ; In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Acquisition of the Stock of Natrogas, \nIncorporated (Natrogas), a Merger of Northern States Power Company (NSP) and Western Gas Utilities, \nInc.

Under Minnesota law, the net benefits standard is not the proper standard \nof review for the proposed Acquisition. As previously noted, the statutory standard is \n“consistent with the public interest,”68 which both this Commission and other states have \ninterpreted to be a “no net harm” standard rather than a net benefit standard.69  \n56. Additionally, this Commission has not previously applied a net benefits \nstandard to Minn.

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES \nA. Minnesota Power \n57. The Carbon Free Standard requires Minnesota utilities to meet 100 percent \nof their retail electric sales with carbon-free generation resources by 2040.70  The \nCompany estimates it will need to make approximately $5 billion in capital investments \nover the next five years to meet its carbon-free goals, including compliance with \nMinnesota’s 2040 Carbon Free Standard, while continuing to provide safe, reliable, and \naffordable service to customers.71 The Company has stated that it is unlikely that it would \nbe able to raise sufficient equity capital from the public markets to meet these capital \nneeds.72  \n58. Minnesota Power stated that the decision to enter into the Acquisition was \nthe result of a lengthy, robust, and carefully thought-out and executed process.73 As a \nresult, the Company chose Partners who have the financial capability, dedication, stable \noperations, commitment to state regulation, aligned vision, and commitment to ALLETE \nas it exists today – allowing the Company to maintain its customer focus, employee \ncommitment, location and community presence, management and leadership, operations \nand strategy, and continuing focus on the clean energy transition.74 \n59. Minnesota Power concluded that, in addition to access to equity capital and \npartner expertise, the Acquisition would provide substantial benefits to customers, which \n \n70 Minn.

For the reasons stated above, Minnesota Power concluded that the \nAcquisition is consistent with the public interest and should be approved by the \nCommission.77 \nB. The Partners \n61. The Partners stated that their interest in acquiring the Company is based \non their desire to make long-term investments in companies engaged in decarbonization \nefforts.78 The Partners stated that they understand the requirement for Minnesota Power \nto comply with the Carbon Free Standard and are committed to helping the Company \nachieve this goal.79 According to the Partners, the Acquisition will eliminate the risk that \nthe Company will be unable to access the equity capital it needs to comply with the \nCarbon Free Standard.80 The Partners stated that the Acquisition will allow the Partners \nto invest needed capital, subject to continued regulation by the Commission, to benefit \nMinnesota Power’s customers and the public interest.81 \n62. In addition, the Partners stated that the Acquisition will benefit the public \ninterest through commitments related to affordability, workforce and labor protections, \nand continuity of leadership and core values at the Company.82 The Acquisition will also \n \n75 Id. at 4-5. \n76 Id. at 5-8. \n77 Id. at 10. \n78 Ex. 13 at 12 (Alley Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-10 ); Ex. 14 at 4 (Bram Direct) (eDocket No. \n202412-212968-09 ).  \n79 Partners’ Initial Post Hearing Brief at 2 (May 1, 2025) (eDocket No. 20255-218522-01 ). \n80 Id. \n81 Id. \n82 Id. \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 17 of 97\n \n \n15 \n benefit the public interest because it will allow the Company to benefit from the Partners’ \nexpertise investing in utilities and renewables as well as their experience in financing \nadvanced energy technologies.83 \n63. The Partners concluded that the Acquisition is in the public interest, and \nshould be approved.84 \nC. The Department \n64. The Department argued that Minnesota Power and the Partners have not \nestablished that the proposed Acquisition will neither produce meaningful benefits nor \nrefuted the risks.85 According to the Department, the Commission cannot be certain the \nAcquisition will finance ALLETE’s energy transition.86 Further, the Department claimed \nthat the Acquisition poses risks to ALLETE’s financial health, ratepayers, and the energy \ntransition because Minnesota Power and the Partners have not proposed adequate \ngovernance and ring-fencing measures or commitments regarding affiliated interests.87 \n65. Accordingly, the Department recommended that the Commission reject the \nproposed Acquisition as inconsistent with the public interest.88 \nD. OAG \n66. The OAG explained that the Acquisition has the potential for benefits and \nthe potential for risks.89 The OAG raised concerns that the Partners would have control \nof the board of directors, raise rates, take on excessive debt, and resell Minnesota Power \n \n83 Id. \n84 Id. \n85 Initial Brief of the Minnesota Department of Commerce at 1 (May 1, 2025) (eDocket No. 20255-218500-\n01). \n86 Id. \n87 Id. \n88 Id. \n89 Ex.

Therefore, the OAG recommended that the Commission find that the \nproposed Acquisition is not consistent with the public interest.93 \nE. CUB \n68. CUB questioned the benefits provided by the Acquisition, including \nimproved access to capital and the Partners’ expertise in renewable energy projects.94 \nCUB also claimed that the potential risks likely outweigh the potential benefits of the \nAcquisition.95 \n69. Specifically, CUB expressed concern that the Partners will push the \nCompany to grow Minnesota Power’s rate base or increase rates more than necessary \nto generate a return on their investment.96 CUB also questioned the Company’s claim \nthat it needs improved access capital to support Minnesota Power’s compliance with the \nCarbon Free Standard in light of the Company’s integrated resource plan.97 Further, CUB \nclaimed that due to the Partners’ investments, the proposed Acquisition would introduce \nconflicts of interest.98 \n \n90 Initial Brief of the Office of the Attorney General – Residential Utilities Division at 1 (May 1, 2025) (eDocket \nNo. 20255-218508-02 ). \n91 Id. \n92 Id. \n93 Id. \n94 Initial Brief of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota at 1-2 (May 1, 2025) (eDocket No. 20255-218534-\n01). \n95 Id. at 2. \n96 Id. \n97 Id. \n98 Id. \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 19 of 97\n \n \n17 \n 70. CUB concluded that the Acquisition is not consistent with the public interest, \nand the Commission should deny its approval.99 \nF. LPI \n71. LPI argued that the testimony does not show that the Company’s capital \nplan is consistent with the public interest or that Minnesota Power could not raise equity \nin public markets.100 Instead, LPI concluded that the Partners’ testimony shows that the \nPartners see the Acquisition as an opportunity to have exclusive access to provide that \ncapital in exchange for generous returns on their investment.101 According to LPI, the \nAcquisition poses a significant cost and risk to customers.102 Further, LPI argued that \nALLETE and the Partners have a burden of proof, which they have not met, to \ndemonstrate tangible benefits of the Acquisition that outweigh the risks and costs.103 \n72. LPI concluded that the proposed Acquisition is not in the public interest and \nrecommended the ALJ and Commission reject it.104 \nG. CURE \n73. CURE argued that the Acquisition poses a risk to Minnesota and to \nMinnesota Power’s customers of cutting off other sources of funding, information from \npublic reporting, the consistent services provided by Minnesota Power’s current \nworkforce, and the access the Minnesota Power now has to additional funding through \npublic markets.105 CURE also claimed that the Acquisition risks imposing Minnesota \nPower with large amounts of debt that ultimately will be paid by Minnesota Power \n \n99 Id. \n100 LPI Initial Brief at 2 (eDocket No. 20255-218497-02 ). \n101 Id. \n102 Id. \n103 Id. at 3. \n104 Id. at 1. \n105 CURE Initial Brief at 4-5 (eDocket No. 20255-218524-01 ). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 20 of 97\n \n \n18 \n customers and increases the risk of bankruptcy.106 According to CURE, these risks, plus \nthe Partners’ profit interests, also risk the probability of Minnesota Power meeting the \nCarbon Free Standard on the expected timeline.107 \n74. Therefore, CURE recommended that the Commission reject the \nAcquisition.108 \nH. ECC \n75. ECC concludes that the Acquisition offers real potential benefits in \nincreasing the Company’s access to capital at a time of intense need for capital \nexpenditures.109 ECC also stated that it believes that the potential harms associated with \nthe Acquisition are accounted for by the mandates of the regulatory compact.110 Further, \nECC stated that the Partners’ commitment to provide capital through arrearage relief is a \nonce-in-a-generation opportunity to improve the financial security of low-income \ncustomers.111 \n76. ECC concluded that the Acquisition is compatible with the public interest.112 \nI. Sierra Club \n77. Sierra Club claimed that the Acquisition is likely to increase costs and risks \nwhile offering no benefits for Minnesota Power customers.113 According to Sierra Club, \nthe Acquisition may delay the Company’s transition to renewable energy, prolong \noperation of the Boswell Energy Center, and hinder the Company’s compliance with the \n \n106 Id. at 5. \n107 Id. \n108 Id. \n109 Ex.

Accordingly, Sierra Club recommended that the Commission not approve \nthe proposed Acquisition.117 \nJ. IBEW \n79. IBEW stated that the ratification of a two-year extension of its collective \nbargaining agreement with Minnesota Power offers additional stability and protection for \nIBEW members.118 IBEW appreciated the Company’s recognition of the concerns initially \nraised by IBEW and the Company’s willingness to work with IBEW to establish additional \nassurances for its members.119 \n80. With the ratified extension in place, IBEW stated that it supports the \nAcquisition.120 \nK. Local 49, NCSRCC, and LIUNA \n81. Local 49, NCSRCC, and LIUNA (collectively, the “Unions”) stated that \nabsent the proposed transaction, Minnesota Power will be unable to make the \ninvestments necessary to meet its obligations – a circumstance that could not only impair \njob-creation but also have serious negative repercussions for customers and the state as \n \n114 Id. at 2. \n115 Id. \n116 Id. \n117 Id. \n118 Ex.

Further, the Unions observed that (1) none of the intervenors has provided \na credible basis for concluding that private investors are more driven than public investors \nto maximize risk-adjusted returns; and (2) the interests of privately held infrastructure \nfunds actually align better with the public interest because their returns and reputations \nare more closely tied to the long-term health and value of the utility, rather than quarterly \nearnings. And the long-term health and value of the utility turns on the utility meeting \nmetrics of concern to customers, regulators, workers, and the State as a whole.123 \n83. The Unions concluded that they strongly support the Acquisition and believe \nit is consistent with the public interest as required by Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 and should \nbe approved by the Commission.124 \nV. BENEFITS, RISKS, AND PROPOSED COMMITMENTS OF THE \nACQUISITION \nA. Financial Benefits to Minnesota Power \n1.

ALLETE is one of the smallest utilities in the country by market \ncapitalization,139 but its need for equity capital is the largest of any utility in proportion to \nits market capitalization.140 As shown in Schedule 2 of Witness Quackenbush’s Rebuttal \nTestimony, ALLETE’s equity needs for 2025-2027 are estimated to be approximately \nthree times the median of United States utilities (16 percent for ALLETE and 5.3 percent \nfor all utilities).141 \n90. ALLETE’s capital investment requirements are accelerating at a rate more \nthan three times historical expenditures.142 ALLETE’s projected capital expenditures are \n3.8 times (380 percent) of its average expenditures compared to the 1.25 times average \nincrease for other utilities.143 \n \n136 Ex.

Minnesota Power’s Forecasted Investment Needs for Regulated \nOperations are Reliable. \n91. Some parties argue that Minnesota Power’s investment forecast is \noverstated.144 The evidence in the record demonstrates that Minnesota Power’s \ninvestment forecast is reasonable and not overstated. \n92. Minnesota Power’s capital expenditure forecasts for regulated operations \nhave been historically accurate. When excluding the COVID-driven year of 2020, the \naverage variance in Minnesota Power’s capital forecast related to regulated operations \nover the last five years is only five percent.145  \n93. ALLETE’s expected investment levels for Minnesota Power include costs \nfor transmission projects that are already approved and under development, and which \nwill ultimately require billions of dollars in investments.146 ALLETE’s capital expenditure \nforecast also includes costs related to wind and solar acquisitions that have already been \nselected pursuant to a competitive bidding process for which the Department has \nrecommended approval or are currently underway.147 These investments are known and \nnot speculative. \n \n145 Ex. MP-29 at 13 (Taran Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-05 ). As Witness Taran explained, it is \nreasonable to exclude the 2020 COVID-year when evaluating forecast variance, because the pandemic’s \nimpact on delaying capital projects could not have been anticipated. Even including the 2020 COVID-year, \nthe average variance over the last five years was only 9 percent. \n145 Ex. MP-29 at 13 (Taran Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-05 ).

Second, the arguments raised by some parties to question the reliability of \nALLETE’s capital expenditure forecast are not supported by the record. \n95. Some parties argue that ALLETE could delay or defer non-regulated \ninvestments.148 Delay or deferment of non-regulated investments would not materially \nreduce the capital expenditure forecast because non-regulated investments make up a \nsmall fraction of the forecast.149 \n96. Some parties argue that Minnesota Power should use more Power \nPurchase Agreements (“PPAs”) to reduce the need for capital investment.150 but admit \nthat the Company cannot prudently assume PPAs will be available or beneficial for \ncustomers when planning to meet its obligations.151 Further, the parties do not recognize \nthat utility projects are often more reliable or lower-cost than PPAs, and concede that the \nCommission will decide in separate proceedings which projects are best for customers \nand the right balance of PPAs for Minnesota Power’s system.152 The potential for \nCompany ownership, where appropriate, is important given the increasing cost and \nconsiderable volatility in renewable energy PPAs over the last several years.153 Some \nparties’ witnesses do not recognize that credit rating agencies include imputed debt for \nPPAs in their calculations of credit metrics, meaning that overreliance on PPAs would \nhave a negative impact on the Company’s credit ratings.154 \n \n148 Ex.

OAG argues that Minnesota Power should allow customers more freedom \nto produce their own electricity or participate in load-flexibility or demand response \nprograms to reduce the need for future capital expenditures.155 These arguments fail to \naccount for the fact that Minnesota Power extensively uses demand response and load \nflexibility, and the record does not include any assessment of the potential for or additional \ncost of adding more demand response or load flexibility, nor any proposals or \nrecommendations to do so or analysis of the associated incremental benefit or harm.156 \n98.  OAG argues that ALLETE should sell its non-regulated businesses to \nreduce the need for future capital expenditures.157 There is no record evidence that such \nsales would address the need for capital, and any such sales would have limited financial \nbenefit and would potentially harm ALLETE and Minnesota Power. .158 \n100. Some parties also argue that ALLETE should sell its ownership in \ntransmission projects159 but do not acknowledge Minnesota’s statutes establish a policy \npreference for incumbent utilities to own transmission lines (which provide reliability and \nrelated safety benefits).160 Minnesota Power’s ownership of transmission lines provides \nsignificant financial benefits for Minnesota Power’s customers.

Even if Minnesota Power could offset some capital investment or its needs \nturn out to be lower than the current forecast, the record demonstrates that the Company’s \ninvestment needs are increasing substantially, including as a result of some already-\napproved projects. For example, the $4.6 billion forecast for Regulated Operations could \nbe off by 20 percent (which is four times greater than the five percent historical variance) \nand Minnesota Power’s investment needs still would be triple the level of historical \ninvestments.163 \n100. OAG and LPI suggest that the Company should slow its dividend growth to \nretain capital for investment.164 Record evidence demonstrates that slowing dividend \ngrowth would have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to raise equity capital in \nthe public market and on the total economic cost of the Company’s overall capital \nexpenditures.165 The Acquisition will allow the Company to reduce dividend growth \n \n161 Ex.

Relying on Public Markets for Needed Equity Funding would be \nRisky for Customers and Minnesota Power. \n102. Regulated utilities like Minnesota Power fund capital investments using debt \nand equity.169 Minnesota Power obtains debt financing by issuing first mortgage bonds, \ngenerally to large financial institutions, and plans to continue to do so.170 Historically, \nMinnesota Power has obtained equity capital by issuing common shares to potential \ninvestors through public stock markets.171 In order to obtain equity capital, ALLETE must \nissue new shares, a process that involves significant time, cost and risk.172 \n103. As previously explained, the Company has a significant need for capital \ninvestment at unprecedented levels in the near term.173 The record supports the \nconclusion that relying on public markets for needed equity funding would be too risky. \n \n166 See Evid.

Witness Scissons testified that “it would be highly unlikely the Company \ncould achieve its carbon free goals as planned” without the Acquisition.177 \n107. Witness Quackenbush agreed that ALLETE would face severe challenges \naccessing the required equity from public markets.178 \n108. Witness Bram testified that “[t]he idea that ALLETE could access public \nequity at the scale and pace that is needed is not based on reality and would likely result \nin significant challenges for the utility.”179 \n109. Based on evidence in the record, it would be challenging and risky for \nMinnesota Power to rely on public markets for access to capital for several reasons: \n \n174 Id. at 7-8. \n175 Ex.

First, the record shows that investing in ALLETE is inherently more risky \ncompared to investing in most other utilities.180 ALLETE is small compared to other \npublicly traded utilities181 and faces unique risks given its high concentration of sales to \ncyclical industrial customers.182 According to LIUNA Witness Bryant, these factors can be \n“red flags” not only for labor union pension funds but for any investor.183 Equity investors \nin public markets decide where to place their investments based on their expectations of \nrisk versus returns.184 Given ALLETE’s higher risk relative to other utilities, it is reasonable \nto conclude that today public investors need to receive an increased level of returns from \nan investment in ALLETE or they will take their capital elsewhere. \n111. The risks associated with Minnesota Power’s high concentration of market-\nsensitive industrial sales have been borne out by recent events. In January 2025, US \nSteel, Minnesota Power’s largest single customer, provided a four-year notice that it \nwould terminate its electric service agreement with Minnesota Power.185 On March 20, \n2025, Cleveland-Cliffs, Minnesota Power’s second-largest customer, announced that it \nwould idle two mines in Minnesota Power’s service territory, and lay off more than 600 \nworkers.186 Absent the Acquisition (and associated expectation that shares will be \npurchased by the Partners at a fixed price), the announcements of these events likely \n \n180 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service \nin Minnesota , Docket No. E015/GR-16-664, Findings of Fact, Conclusions, and Order at 53 (Mar. 12, 2018) \n(eDocket No. 20183-140963-01 ); In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to \nIncrease Rates for Electric Service in Minnesota , Docket No. E015/GR-21-335, Findings of Fact, \nConclusions, and Order at 63 (Feb. 28, 2023) (eDocket No. 20232-193486-01 ). \n181 Ex.

Second, ALLETE’s inherent risks are amplified because of uncertainty in \nthe market. At the time of Rebuttal Testimony on March 4, 2025, Witness Scissons \ntestified that concerns about the “potential impact of tariffs, customer uncertainty, \ntermination notices and interest rate volatility” could impact ALLETE’s ability to access \nequity on public markets.188 Witness Quackenbush agreed that “uncertainty in tariff and \ntrade issues enhance . . . concerns” about ALLETE’s access to capital.189 \n113. Third, ALLETE would need to be a serial issuer to raise the amount of equity \ncapital it needs through public markets. A serial issuer has “perpetually repeating \nissuance needs,” and may need to issue new shares “every year or even more often.”190 \nWitness Quackenbush testified that, in order to meet its capital need through public \nmarkets, ALLETE would need to make public equity issuance at least once (or more) \nevery year.191 As noted above, in the 25 years since 2000, ALLETE has had only three \npublic issuances of equity. Witnesses Taran, Scissons, and Quackenbush testified that \nraising the necessary public capital would invariably require serial issuances, which would \nin turn drive down ALLETE’s stock price, increase the cost of capital, and increase the \ncost of service to customers.192 \n \n187 See Ex. MP-28 at 6 (Scissons Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-04 ) (“Without the transaction, the \nmarket likely would have reacted negatively to [the US Steel announcement] . . . .”). \n188 Id. at 7-8. \n189 Ex.

Obtaining this volume of new equity from public markets would also have a \nnegative impact on the Company’s cashflow. Record evidence indicates that relying on \npublic markets would require ALLETE to issue many more shares to public shareholders, \nwho expect to receive regular dividends in addition to the amount already spent on annual \ndividends.193 This will impact customers by putting pressure on the cash ALLETE has to \noperate its business and make the investments it needs. Based on the Acquisition stock \nprice and current annual dividends, the record shows that obtaining $1 billion in new \nequity from public markets could increase dividend obligations by as much as $43 million \nper year.194 \n115. Cash flow is a critical part of credit rating analysis, and negative impacts on \ncash flow could adversely affect credit ratings. Based on evidence in the record, if \nALLETE has trouble accessing capital, credit ratings agencies will notice and incorporate \nthose challenges in their ratings analysis.195 \n116. Every time ALLETE issues equity there is an associated cost, referred to as \n“flotation costs.”196 197 If the Acquisition is approved, the Petitioners have committed that \nflotation costs will not be included in future rates. If the Company is, instead, required to \nrely on public markets, it will incur flotation costs every time it issues equity. Flotation \n \n193 Id. at 20 (“In the public markets, equity investors expect to earn a return through both dividends and \nstock appreciation.”). \n194 $1 billion / $67 acquisition price = ~15 million shares.

Witness Scissons also explained that issuing additional equity would \nrequire additional resource commitments by the Investor Relations team. As the need for \npublic equity expands, ALLETE would need to increase the size and cost of its investor \nrelations team, which would also increase costs for ratepayers.198 \n118. Issuing millions of additional shares on public markets could have a \nnegative impact on shareholders. An evaluation of the public interest appropriately \nfocuses on potential impacts on customers as well as effects on existing shareholders.199 \nEach time new shares are issued, the ownership interests of existing shares are reduced \nand, if new shares are issued at lower prices, it can further drive down the value of existing \nshares.200 ALLETE has obligations to consider the interests of its shareholders.201 While \nthe Company also has obligations to provide safe, reliable, and affordable service, it \nwould not be reasonable to force the Company to take actions that harm its existing \nshareholders to fund its capital plan, when an alternative path—the Acquisition—is \navailable that is consistent with the public interest considerations affecting both customers \nand shareholders. \n4. The Acquisition will Avoid the Risks of Relying on Public Markets. \n119.

Department Witness Addonizio recognized that public stockholders have no \nconstraints whatsoever on their ability to make or withhold investments, whereas the \nPartners are much more limited and will have a greater stake in the health and success \nof the utility if the acquisition is approved.203  \n121. The Partners are able to inject equity capital or adjust dividend payments \nmore flexibly than public investors, who expect quarterly dividend payments and respond \nto missed or reduced payments by selling their shares, reducing share price, and \ndemanding higher returns as compensation for higher risk.204 \n122. As part of the Acquisition, the Partners, through Alloy Parent (the entity that \nwill hold their investment in ALLETE and through which the Partners will finance \nALLETE), have committed to provide to Minnesota Power equity financing, in an amount \nat least equal to the equity financing required to fund Minnesota Power’s five-year capital \nplan set forth in ALLETE’s February 2025 Form 10-K including but not limited to equity \ninfusions, deferral or reinvestment of dividends, or a combination of those methods.205 \n123.

Witness Taran explains that utilities typically fund their operations through \na mix of equity and debt to balance financial considerations and risk management.220 \nWhile debt financing is generally lower cost than equity financing, it adds financial risk \ndue to the obligation to make interest payments, which places pressure on credit \nratings.221 Thus, utilities seek a balanced capital structure that allows for just and \n \n217 Id. \n218 Ex.

This Acquisition is not expected to affect Minnesota Power’s approved \ncapital structure, and under the Company’s current corporate structure the Commission \nwill maintain ongoing oversight over both Minnesota Power’s regulated and ALLETE’s \nconsolidated capital structure. Witness Addonizio acknowledged that this provides more \noversight than the Commission has over utilities that are separate legal entities from their \nparent companies.223ALLETE already currently carries a lower percentage of debt in its \nconsolidated capital structure than other Minnesota energy companies. 224 The varying \nlevels of debt within the capital structure of Minnesota energy companies indicates that \nmore or less debt is not, by itself, negative.225 \n131. Some parties assume that all private equity firms are the same and that \nprivate equity investors necessarily behave in the same manner. Some parties’ witnesses \nclaim that because the Partners are private equity investors, they are likely to seek higher \nreturns on their investment in ALLETE than public equity investors and to employ financial \nengineering strategies to increase their returns, ultimately harming the financial health of \nMinnesota Power.226 These assumptions do not acknowledge the role the Commission \nplays in ensuring utility investors are able to earn only reasonable returns. \n132.

Some witnesses also claim that the Partners could use over-leveraging \nwhich could increase Minnesota Power’s cost of capital, harm ALLETE’s credit ratings, \nand increase customer rates.229 \n134. Similarly, Witness Baker claims that private equity investors in general over-\nleverage through dividend recapitalization, which increases bankruptcy risk.230 \n135. Concerns regarding the excessive use of debt by the Partners are \nunsupported by the record. These concerns are rooted in academic publications that \nmake general statements not applicable to the Partners or the investment in a regulated \nutility like ALLETE.231 Witness Addonizio acknowledged that the theory behind the \npotential use of an excessive amount of debt applies equally to public stockholders (i.e., \nALLETE’s current structure) as to private infrastructure funding.232 \n136. The approaches toward debt described by some parties’ witnesses also run \ncounter to the Partners’ stated investment strategies.

Likewise, Witness Bram explains that GIP is not investing in ALLETE to use \nstrategies for the purpose of extracting value in the short-term,234 and GIP’s investment \ndocumentation expressly disavows such a strategy.235 Witness Bram explains that GIP’s \ninvestment in ALLETE is intended to be long-term, with a focus on investing further in and \nsupporting ALLETE to ensure that it can achieve its clean energy objectives and continue \nto successfully serve customers.236 Each of the Partner witnesses testified that the \nsuccess of the Partners’ investment strategies is predicated on the long-term success of \nthe Company, rather than undercutting its long-term value with short-term extractions.237 \n138. Some parties’ witnesses refer to data provided by the Partners to suggest \nthat the Partners will employ “financial engineering” strategies to increase their returns by \nincreasing debt at the Alloy Parent level.238 \n139. For example, some parties’ witnesses claim that the Partners will over-\nleverage debt at ALLETE and Alloy Parent to increase their returns.239 The parties’ \nconcern regarding over-leveraging of debt to increase returns is contradicted by the fact \nthat the Partners are using a limited amount of debt ($300 million out of a $  3.9 billion \npurchase price, or approximately 8 percent of the Acquisition price) to fund the \nAcquisition, which materially limits the amount of leverage and is significantly less \n \n233 Ex.

The levels of any future, post-Acquisition debt that will be incurred by \nALLETE will be subject to ongoing Commission supervision. Partner witnesses explain \nthat post-Acquisition debt at Alloy Parent will be incurred at levels designed to achieve \ncredit metrics for an investment grade rating.242 Rather than over-leverage, this is a \nreasonable approach to the use of debt for ALLETE. \n141.

The total returns to the Partners reflected in their internal documents do not \npose a risk to Minnesota Power customers for several reasons. The documents expressly \nstate that these returns are calculations of what might occur, and do not reflect a plan or \nrequirement to be imposed by the Partners.246 The Partners’ internal documents also do \nnot reflect a plan to change ongoing operations of the Company or to increase either the \nauthorized ROE or actual earned ROE. The Partners’ internal documents show the \nprimary component of the Partners’ return will result from increasing ALLETE’s value and \ndecreasing ALLETE’s risk by accomplishing the transition from coal dependency to \nenvironmental compliance under the Carbon Free Standard.247 The Partners’ expectation \nthat the value of the Company will increase as it complies with the Carbon Free Standard \nis consistent with the public interest. \n143. The various ring-fencing commitments made by the Company and the \nPartners will protect Minnesota Power and its customers from concerns regarding the \noperations of Alloy Parent and other affiliates. Witness Addonizio admitted that248 all debt \nheld at Alloy Parent will be non-recourse to Minnesota Power, meaning that it will not be \nsecured by utility assets and ALLETE would have no obligation to repay the debt under \nany circumstances, offering further protection to Minnesota Power and its customers.249 \n144. Some parties’ witnesses claim that data provided by the Partners show that \nthe Partners expect to earn higher-than-reasonable returns.250 The returns discussed in \nthe Partners’ documents relate to a return on their overall investment in ALLETE, which \n \n246 See, e.g.,  Ex.

Witness Bram explains that the Partners evaluate \npotential investments, such as this Acquisition, by making assumptions about certain \nfacts and trends, and modeling various scenarios.252 “Those scenarios are not necessarily \nsituations or things we think will happen or want to happen, but they are scenarios we \nneed to consider to fully evaluate the investment.”253 Thus, the concerns raised by the \nparties’ witnesses regarding higher-than-reasonable returns are not borne out by the \nrecord. \n145. The Commission will also retain its full authority to regulate ALLETE and \nMinnesota Power’s capital structure, including the cost of debt and ROE.254 More \nspecifically, the Commission closely evaluates and establishes the amount of debt and \nequity that can be included in the regulated utility’s capital structure for setting rates. This \nregulation directly affects customer rates.255 Additionally, utilities also must seek approval \nfor their actual capital structure and must propose to the Commission a ratio of equity to \ndebt, as well as a contingency range for that ratio, and limits on both short-term and long-\nterm debt.256 This regulation does not directly affect customer rates but places limits on \n \n251 Ex.

The Commission engages in both of these functions as it relates \nto Minnesota Power (through rate cases) and ALLETE (through capital structure filings). \n146. The Commission’s continued regulatory role will assure protection of \nMinnesota Power customers and the public interest.257 There is no evidence in the record, \nand no basis for parties’ concerns that the Commission will not be able to, or be unwilling \nto, exercise the same level of authority and impose the same standards of protection after \nthe Acquisition as it has exercised in the past, which include supervision of all material \ninvestments and all costs to be recovered in Minnesota Power customer rates.  \n147. The Partners have also confirmed their understanding that the Commission \nhas authority over these structures and that will not change with the Acquisition.258 \nWitness Addonizio also acknowledges that the Commission’s authority will remain the \nsame if the Acquisition is approved.259 \n148. As stated by Witness Addonizio, the Commission has more direct control \nover the capital structure, as well as the ratios of debt and equity, of ALLETE today than \nother utility parent holding companies due to ALLETE not being separated from the \nMinnesota Power operating utility.260 Specifically, due to this legal structure, ALLETE \nmust obtain Commission approval for its capital structure, including its debt and equity, \nwhich is not the case for utility parent holding companies that are separate from their \nMinnesota operating utilities.261 This increased oversight and control will protect \nMinnesota Power and its customers from any potential risks of the Acquisition. \n \n257 See, generally,  Minn.

Additionally, Minnesota Power and the Partners have made commitments \nto protect Minnesota Power and its customers against the risks perceived by the \nparties.262 \n150. For instance, Minnesota Power and the Partners have committed that \nALLETE will not make any dividend or distribution that would cause the actual equity ratio \nof Minnesota Power to be outside the range approved by the Commission.263 This \ncommitment ensures that no dividends or distributions are issued that could impair \nALLETE’s financial viability.264 \n151. The Company also will not make any dividend or distribution to Alloy Parent \nunless at least one senior unsecured credit rating is investment grade or above.265 This \ncommitment protects the Company’s credit rating, and therefore the cost of debt, and \nagain limits the Partners’ ability to take distributions.266 Currently, there is no regulatory \nlimitation on when ALLETE may make a dividend or distribution.267 \n152. Each of these protections helps ensure the financial health of ALLETE and \nthe Minnesota Power utility, regardless of any concerns about the Partners’ intent. \n153.

The Ring-Fencing Commitments \n158. Ring-fencing is a term used to describe arrangements that keep a regulated \nutility business separate from the non-utility affiliates or holding company parent of the \nutility.277 As Witness Lapson explained, “ring-fencing mechanisms have been \nsuccessfully used to protect utilities from risky parents or affiliated companies and have \nproven effective in allowing the Protected Companies to carry out their mandate to serve \npresent and future customers.”278 \n159. Many of ALLETE’s ring-fencing commitments were established at pages \n20-21 of the Petition.279 The key commitments include: \n ALLETE and Alloy Parent will maintain separate books and records, agree to \nprohibitions against loans or pledges of assets of ALLETE without regulatory \napproval, and generally hold ALLETE harmless from any business and financial \nrisk exposures associated with Alloy Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates (other \nthan any subsidiary of ALLETE); \n ALLETE and Alloy Parent will maintain separate stock and debt; \n Neither ALLETE nor Alloy Parent shall provide direct credit support to a credit \nfacility of the other through a guarantee, and none of ALLETE’s credit facilities \nshall include any cross-default provision whereby a default under any of Alloy \nParent’s credit facilities would cause a default under any of ALLETE’s credit \nfacilities; \n ALLETE will maintain its own corporate and debt rating, and its own ratings for \nlong-term debt;  \n ALLETE will not make or declare a distribution, unless on the date of such \ndistribution ALLETE’s credit rating is investment grade, except with prior approval \nof the Commission; and \n \n277 Ex.

Witness Anderson provided additional context for the commitments that \nwere presented in the Petition. Witness Anderson confirmed that Alloy Parent will have \nseparate financial accounts from ALLETE – the accounts of the two will not be \ncommingled.281 In addition, ALLETE will not be an obligor on the debt that Alloy Parent is \nincurring in connection with the Acquisition.282 Witness Anderson noted that the \nCommission will have the authority and opportunity to confirm these ring-fencing \narrangements as Minnesota Power continues to file its annual corporate structure petition \nand other compliance filings.283 In Rebuttal Testimony, the Company and the Partners \nmade two additional ring-fencing commitments: \n Alloy Parent will not use utility assets to guarantee Alloy Parent debt; and \n Minnesota Power will be prohibited from loaning funds to or borrowing funds from \nAlloy Parent or other upstream entities.284 \n161. Witness Lapson prepared a list of the Company’s ring-fencing \ncommitments.285 The commitments were also summarized and reaffirmed by ALLETE \nWitness Cady.286 ALLETE acknowledged that the ring-fencing commitments could be \n \n280 Ex.

Witness Lapson’s Analysis of the Ring-Fencing Commitments \n162. Witness Lapson has extensive experience, including many years of \nexperience at rating agencies and then many years of experience as a consultant, \nanalyzing the adequacy and appropriateness of ring-fencing measures in the context of \na utility transaction.288 Witness Lapson has developed a set of systematic and \ncomprehensive standards regarding the protection of a company from adversity as a \nresult of its affiliation with a parent or affiliated entities that has been used in multiple \nregulatory proceedings where acquisitions have been approved by state regulatory \ncommissions.289 \n163. Witness Lapson analyzed the ring-fencing commitments made by ALLETE \nand the Partners. In doing so, Witness Lapson also considered the protections that exist \nbecause of the Commission’s regulatory authority over Minnesota Power, which will \nremain unchanged if the Acquisition is approved by the Commission.290  \n164. Witness Lapson concluded that the ring-fencing commitments are \n“strong”291 and that they conformed to her framework such that they “will provide an \nadequate separation of ALLETE from risks associated with affiliation with the Partners \nand any other companies under their ownership or control.”292 \n \n287 Minnesota Power Initial Brief at 29 (eDocket No. 20255-218485-01 ). \n288 Ex.

The Ring-Fencing Commitments Made by ALLETE and the \nPartners Provide Adequate Protections  \n165. Witness Vavro acknowledged that the ring-fencing commitments made by \nALLETE and the Partners are “generally consistent with those that have been proposed \nin other take-private transactions.”293 Witnesses for the parties generally argued that the \nring-fencing commitments were nevertheless insufficient.294 \n166. As a preliminary matter, the other parties did not put forth an expert witness \nwith experience relating to ring-fencing and related issues.295 \n167. The only specific ring-fencing measure proposal suggested by parties other \nthan Petitioners was a legal non-consolidation opinion, which was offered “as an \nexample.”296 A legal non-consolidation opinion is a “second opinion,” prepared by a \nlawyer, opining that if the acquiring company declares bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court \nwould not order the substantive consolidation of the acquired company.297  \n168. Witness Lapson testified that such opinions are not part of typical standards \nand are not necessary because “I don’t think that [such an opinion] creates any added \nprotection or any protection at all.”298 On cross-examination, Witness Vavro admitted that \na legal non-consolidation opinion is “not a guarantee that substantive consolidation will \nnot occur” and that non-consolidation opinions are “not a financial shield against \n \n293 Ex.

Considered as a whole, the record evidence is inconclusive, at best, as to \nwhether a non-consolidation opinion would provide meaningful additional protection for \nthe Company and its customers in the event of the bankruptcy of Alloy Parent or any other \nAlloy Parent entities or affiliates.  \n170. There is no record evidence supporting the need for any other ring-fencing \nmeasures beyond those offered by the Petitioners. The record evidence demonstrates \nthat ring-fencing commitments made by ALLETE and the Partners on this Acquisition \nrecord are appropriate and sufficient to protect Minnesota Power from perceived risks \nassociated with Alloy Parent and the Partners. Witness Lapson, the only witness with \nexperience using a set of systematic and comprehensive standards to analyze the \nadequacy of ring-fencing commitments, concluded that the commitments made by \nALLETE and the Partners provide “adequate protection in all circumstances.”300 ALLETE \nand the Partners have since offered further ring-fencing commitments to provide \nadditional protection to Minnesota Power and its customers. Accordingly, the ring-fencing \ncommitments made by ALLETE and the Partners are reasonable and provide adequate \nprotection for Minnesota Power and its customers. The ring-fencing commitments are \nexpressly included in the ordering paragraphs below. \n \n299 Id. at 478:2-11. \n300 Ex. MP-16 at 5 (Lapson Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212973-01 ). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 55 of 97\n \n \n53 \n 4. Conversion to a Holding Company is Outside the Scope of This \nProceeding \n171. In connection with the ring-fencing commitments, some Parties argued that \nALLETE’s current corporate structure fails to adequately protect Minnesota Power from \nrisk associated with ALLETE’s non-regulated subsidiaries, and that ALLETE should be \nreorganized into a holding company structure whereby the Minnesota Power operating \nutility is no longer the same legal entity as ALLETE, Inc.301  \n172. ALLETE’s Petition did not make any request or proposal relating to \nreorganization into a holding company structure, and such reorganization is not within the \nscope of the issues referred to OAH by the Commission.302 The transaction at issue in \nthis docket neither precludes nor requires any change in ALLETE’s corporate structure.  \n173. For these reasons, the issue of reorganizing ALLETE into a holding \ncompany structure is not within the scope of this proceeding. Nevertheless, because of \nthe attention brought to this issue, the following findings address the arguments relating \nto it.  \n174. To begin with, it is undisputed that the Acquisition will not result “in any \nchange to the companies within the ALLETE family or in any changes to the \narrangements, contracts, and agreements within that family (except that an updated tax \nsharing agreement will be completed).”303 There are already safeguards in place (such \nas the use of separate corporate entities for non-regulated businesses, separation \n \n301 Ex.

MP-15 at 7 (Anderson Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-06 ). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 56 of 97\n \n \n54 \n between Minnesota Power’s assets and the ALLETE debt used by non-regulated \nbusinesses, and Commission-approved affiliated interest and cost allocation agreements \nand requirements) that appropriately and sufficiently protect Minnesota Power from risks \nassociated with ALLETE’s non-regulated businesses.304  \n175. The Commission has considered the Company’s cost allocations process, \ncorporate structure, and other attributes to generally be satisfactory.305 Although the \nCompany has explored and presented information regarding the pros and cons of a \nholding company structure, the Commission has not concluded that anything should be \ndone to change the Company’s existing corporate structure.306  \n176. Testimony suggesting ALLETE’s current corporate structure is unduly risky \nis not credible, because it implies that the Commission has failed in its ongoing regulatory \noversight of ALLETE for decades. Testimony from the Department suggesting that \nALLETE’s structure is inappropriate is especially unpersuasive, because the Department \nis well aware of the safeguards that are in place at ALLETE, and in a recent proceeding, \nthe Department considered them sufficient.307 \n177. Witness Vavro emphasized that formation of a holding company has been \na topic of discussion between ALLETE and the Commission, and that in 2023 ALLETE \nwas considering the submission of a holding company reorganization petition.308 But that \ndoes not mean adoption of a holding company structure is required, would be feasible, or \nwould be wise while the Acquisition is taking place. Reorganization of ALLETE into a \n \n304 Ex. MP-35 at 3 (Anderson Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-06 ). \n305 Id.  \n306 Id.  \n307 Ex. MP-50; Evid. Hrg.

Moreover, if ALLETE were to organize into a holding company structure, it \nis possible that the Commission and other stakeholders would have less transparency \ninto finances at the ALLETE and Alloy Parent levels, at least in some ways, than what \nALLETE and the Partners are proposing in the Acquisition. For example, ALLETE is \nproposing to continue with its annual capital structure filing, and to include with that filing \nfull audited consolidated financial statements for both ALLETE and Alloy Parent.310  \n179. In contrast, the Commission does not receive information about the capital \nstructure or corporate structure of Xcel Energy’s or Otter Tail Power’s holding companies, \ndoes not regulate the consolidated capital structure of either company, and does not have \ninsight into how debt is raised at the holding company level.311  \n180. In sum, intervenors’ arguments seeking the reorganization of ALLETE to a \nholding company structure as a condition of approval of the Acquisition are unpersuasive. \nThat issue should be addressed in a separate proceeding. \nD.

According to Company Witness Scissons, there will be no changes as to \nhow Minnesota Power develops its strategy and presents that information to the ALLETE \nBoard as a result of the Acquisition.315 Witness Scissons stated the following:  \nCurrently, talented professionals at Minnesota Power develop strategic \nplans and submit them to the Board for approval. Following the [Acquisition], \nstrategic plans will still be developed by professionals at Minnesota Power \nand submitted to the [ALLETE] Board for approval, and the strategic \nplanning is expected to be developed by the same teams and individuals \nbecause of commitments by the Partners to the continuity of Minnesota \nPower’s workforce. Additionally, as further detailed in the Direct Testimony \nof Company Witness Cady, the Partners are supportive of Minnesota \nPower’s collaborative approach to stakeholder engagement going \nforward.316 \n183. The ALLETE Board will be established based on decisions by the ALLETE \nshareholders – the Partners.317 The Department, OAG and Sierra Club raised concerns \nrelated to the control of the ALLETE Board.318  \n \n312 Ex.

The boards of directors of companies (including ALLETE’s current board) \nare elected by the shareholders – whether public or private – and are expected to \nrepresent their interests. It is commonly expected that members of a board of directors \nwill own shares of the company they are overseeing (currently the case for ALLETE and \nXcel Energy), as that aligns board members with the investors they represent and gives \nboard members a vested interest in the success of the company they serve.328 A board \nof directors that is fully or even mostly independent from its investors does not align with \nthese principles. \n188. Minnesota law requires that any director fulfill the duties of their position “in \ngood faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the \ncorporation.”329 Minnesota law further clarifies that “[i]n discharging the duties of the \nposition of director, a director may . . . consider the interests of the corporation’s \nemployees, customers, suppliers, and creditors, the economy of the state and nation, \ncommunity and societal considerations, and the long-term as well as short-term interests \nof the corporation and its shareholders . . . .”330  \n189.

The Partners indicated that they are seeking to acquire the shares of \nALLETE because  of its strategic direction.332 They also indicated that they are committed \nto the autonomy of Minnesota Power’s management in its day-to-day operations, to \nensure that Minnesota Power is able to meet it regulatory requirements and continue to \nprovide safe, reliable, and affordable electric service to its customers.333  \n191. According to evidence presented, the current ALLETE Board selected the \nPartners because ALLETE and the Partners are aligned, and therefore is comfortable \nwith the proposed post-Acquisition ALLETE Board structure. Even if certain decisions are \nmade by the ALLETE Board, Minnesota Power, its capital structure, its rates, its resource \nplanning, its transmission and distribution planning, and its affiliated interests will all \nremain subject to the review, oversight, and approval of the Commission after the \nAcquisition.334  \nE. Affiliated Interests \n192. Many of the Parties raised concerns about the application of Minnesota’s \nAffiliated Interest Statute335 to Minnesota Power after the transaction. They argued that \nALLETE’s and the Partners’ proposed approach to affiliated interests does not comply \nwith the Affiliated Interest Statute and opens the door to potential self-dealing. \n \n332 Ex.

The Affiliated Interest Statute As Currently Applied \n193. The Commission and Minnesota public utilities have long interpreted the \nAffiliated Interest Statute and its associated rules336 to apply when a company owned in \nwhole or in part by the public utility or the public utility holding company contracts with the \npublic utility governed by the Commission. The purpose of the Affiliated Interest Statute \nis to allow the Commission to ensure that agreements between affiliated companies are \nreasonable and to identify potential self-dealing that could harm customers.337 \n194. Pursuant to the Affiliated Interest Statute, Minnesota electric utilities file an \nannual Affiliated Interest Annual Report (“Annual Affiliate Report”) with the Commission. \nThe Annual Affiliate Report lists all shareholders that own greater than five percent of the \noutstanding shares of each utility’s stock. The longstanding practice has been that these \nAnnual Affiliate Reports do not list the subsidiaries or affiliates of any such shareholder. \nLikewise, reporting has not been required or anticipated when two separately-owned \npublic utilities, each of whose ultimate shares may be held in an amount greater than five \npercent by the same shareholder, contract for business together.338 \n195. This is illustrated by utilities’ April 2025 Annual Affiliate Reports. As of 2025, \nXcel Energy, Otter Tail Power Company, CenterPoint Energy, Minnesota Energy \nResources Corp., and Great Plains Natural Gas are all owned more than 5 percent by \n \n336 Minn. R. 7825.1900 et seq. \n337 Ex. MP-15 at 8 (Anderson Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-06 ); Ex, DOC-301 at 11-12 (Vavro \nDirect) (eDocket No. 20252-214941-03 ). \n338 Ex. MP-6 at 12-13 (Supplemental Filing) (eDocket No. 202410-210823-01 ); For example, while \nVanguard owns more than five percent of the shares of both ALLETE and Otter Tail Power Company, these \nutilities do not make an affiliated interest filing when the utilities jointly develop a transmission line project \nnor do they include such information in their Annual Affiliate Reports.

(“Vanguard”).339 \nNone of these utilities identify the other companies in which BlackRock and Vanguard \nhold investments as affiliated interests. Neither the Commission, the Department, or any \nother stakeholder has raised concerns about these filings or this approach to affiliated \ninterest requirements. \n196. Consistent with this approach, for many years Minnesota Power has filed \nwith the Commission (a) affiliated interest agreements and tax sharing agreements \nbetween it and subsidiaries of ALLETE and (b) its Annual Affiliate Report. Minnesota \nPower’s Annual Affiliate Report lists all shareholders that own greater than five percent \nof the outstanding shares of ALLETE’s stock; but it does not list the subsidiaries or \naffiliates of any such shareholder. Specifically, for a number of years BlackRock and \nVanguard have owned more than five percent of ALLETE’s outstanding shares.340  \n197. The Commission has not treated other companies owned by BlackRock or \nVanguard as being affiliated interests with Minnesota Power that required filings with the \n \n339 In the Matter of Northern States Power Company’s Annual Affiliated Interest Report in Compliance with \nMinn.

Again, the Commission has taken this approach not only as to ALLETE, but \nit has consistently applied this treatment in similar instances to other Minnesota utilities.341  \n198. The Commission’s approach recognizes that institutional investors are \ninvestors, not operators of public utilities. This approach is reasonable—it ensures that \nenough information is provided to allow stakeholders to analyze affiliated interest issues \nand protect against self-dealing, while avoiding the unworkable task of tracking the \nhundreds or thousands of companies in which institutional investors such as BlackRock \nor Vanguard own a stake. As Commission Staff noted, “It is unlikely that there are a \nsignificant number of large or medium-sized publicly-traded companies in the United \nStates that Vanguard and/or BlackRock don’t own 5% or more of . . . . Given the nature \nof Vanguard and BlackRock, it is likely that virtually every contract that many, if not all our \ninvestor-owned utilities undertake with a public traded corporation – and some privately \nheld businesses – would become ‘affiliated interest’ contracts under the approach taken \nby the Department.”342 \n199. According to evidence presented in this proceeding, ALLETE and the \nPartners are not seeking any change in the status quo relating to affiliated interests. Their \nposition is simply that the Commission’s current approach should remain unchanged as \nit applies to Minnesota Power after the transaction closes.  \n \n341 Ex.

The Company and the Partners Propose to Take Additional Steps \nto Minimize Risk Associated with Affiliated Interests \n200.

MP-31 at 40-41 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-09 ); Ex. MP-14 at 28 (Bram Direct) \n(eDocket No. 202412-212968-09 ); Ex. MP-15 at 10-11 (Anderson Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-\n06). The Partners emphasized that any self-dealing would actually be counterproductive to their business \ninterests. As Witness Alley stated, “[A]llegations of self-dealing would do far more harm to the business \nreputation of CPP Investments, both in Minnesota and elsewhere it does business, than any benefit that \ncould be obtained.” Ex. MP-31 at 41 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-09 ). \n344 Ex. MP-15 at 10 (Anderson Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-06 ). ALLETE and the Partners \nundertook reasonable diligence and ascertained that there are not any material contracts between ALLETE \nand its affiliates and CPP Investments or GIP and therefore no additional affiliated interest agreements are \nexpected upon the closing of the transaction. \n345 Ex. MP-15 at 11 (Anderson Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-06 ). Consistent with the Commission \napproach described above, the Annual Affiliate Report will not identify the Partners’ other investments. \n346 Id. The specific GIP and CPP Investments entities are listed on page 14 of Exhibit MP-15. \n347 Ex. MP-35 at 18 (Anderson Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-06 ). \n348 Id.  \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 67 of 97\n \n \n65 \n disclose such contracts within 30 days of execution along with a certification that \nthe contract was entered into at arms-length.349 \n ALLETE will also continue to adhere to its Purchasing Manual, competitive bidding \npolicies, Request for Proposal (“RFP”) processes, Supplier Code of Conduct, and \nCode of Business Conduct, all of which contain provisions that minimize the risk \nof potential self-dealing.350 \n201. These steps are consistent with (in fact, they go considerably above and \nbeyond) the Commission’s longstanding and pragmatic approach to affiliated interests, \nand provide protection against the risk of self-dealing or preferential treatment.  \n3. Certain Parties’ Raised Affiliated Interest Concerns  \n202. Department Witness Vavro expressed concern that the Acquisition will \ncause Minnesota Power to have “hundreds, if not thousands, of new affiliates,” and \naccused the Partners and Minnesota Power of “unwillingness to support the \nCommission’s due diligence efforts to protect ratepayer [sic] from associate [sic] harm, as \nset forth in Minn. Stat. § 216B.48 . . . .”351 Various Parties made similar arguments.  \n203. The approach for which Witness Vavro and various Parties advocate would \nbe a significant change from the way the affiliated interest statute is currently \nimplemented. For years, companies like BlackRock and Vanguard have owned more than \nfive percent of the shares of various Minnesota utilities, but there has been no sign that \nthose relationships have created any concerns about self-dealing or related issues. No \nParty presented explained why it is necessary to change the Commission’s approach to \nthe Affiliated Interest Statute.  \n \n349 Id. The $1 million threshold captures approximately 75 percent of Minnesota Power’s purchase order \nspending, and approximately 94 percent of ALLETE’s non-purchase order spending, during 2024. Id. at \nn. 36. \n350 Ex. MP-15 at 12-13, 15-17 (Anderson Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-06 ).  \n351 Ex. DOC-301 at 3, 31 (Vavro Direct) (eDocket No. 20252-214941-03 ). \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 68 of 97\n \n \n66 \n 204. Witness Vavro stated that she was “unaware of any Commission decision” \nthat adopts the approach for which Minnesota Power and the Commission advocate in \nthis proceeding.352 On cross-examination she acknowledged that she had not actually \nread any utility’s annual affiliated interest reports and was unfamiliar with the \nCommission’s practices.353  \n205. In addition, the approach for which Witness Vavro and various Parties \nadvocate—based on an expansive reading of the Affiliated Interest Statute—is impractical \nand impossible to execute. The legislature does not intent to create results that are \n“absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable.”354 Laws can be interpreted “in a \nsensible manner” to avoid such results.355  \n206. As noted in the Commission Staff’s briefing papers, the Department’s \ninterpretation of the requirements would “result in an increase in the number of contracts \nrequiring Commission approval beyond Staff’s – and the Department’s – current capacity \nto process in a timely manner.”356  \n207. In short, the Department’s approach would be impossible to apply because \nit would cause nearly every business to be considered an affiliated interest. For example, \nXcel Energy, Otter Tail Power, CenterPoint, MERC, and Greater Minnesota Gas would \nall be considered affiliates of ALLETE, each other, and nearly every publicly traded \ncompany on the stock market (because they are all owned more than five percent by \n \n352 Ex.

Other than Witness Vavro (who noted only that the new commitments “may \nhelp with transparency and are a step in the right direction” but were still not enough357), \nno Party presented testimony responsive to the new commitments or provided any \nanalysis about them.358  \n209. The OAG argued that GIP and CPP Investments’ extensive network of \nbusiness relationships (which is actually a benefit of the Transaction) could result in \nMinnesota Power “doing business with affiliates in a way that benefits the Partners’ \nbroader portfolios.”359 This concern is speculative. The process that the Company \nproposed (using questionnaires to identify counterparties more than five percent owned \nby GIP, CPP Investments, or BlackRock, plus separate disclosures of each contract \nabove $1 million with those counterparties) should capture the agreements and \nrelationships that could be of concern. \n210. The corporate structure that will result from the Acquisition – with both GIP \nand CPP Investments having large ownership stakes – provides the Partners with a \nunique set of incentives to minimize the risks of self-dealing or preferential contracts.360 \nGIP is incentivized to make sure that its large investment in ALLETE is not impaired due \nto some improper contract or relationship between an ALLETE entity and a CPP \nInvestments entity, and CPP Investments is incentivized to make sure that its investment \n \n357 Ex.

Several Parties’ concerns about compliance with the Affiliated Interests \nStatute focused especially on BlackRock, arguing that BlackRock’s acquisition of GIP will \ncreate or has created a conflict of interest given BlackRock’s ownership stakes in various \nALLETE customers, suppliers, and competitors.361 The Parties’ arguments about \nBlackRock ignore that if BlackRock’s influence were pernicious, it would already be a \nproblem. As mentioned above, BlackRock owned (as of April 2024) about 13.36 percent \nof ALLETE’s shares. It also owns material percentages of other companies that ALLETE \ndoes business with, such as Cleveland Cliffs (10.99 percent as of June 20, 2024) and \nUnited States Steel (10.41 percent).362  \n212. Parties raised concerns about the potential for increased electric load from \ndata centers to shift infrastructure costs to other ratepayers.363 In particular, CURE \nsuggested that utility rate structures and confidentiality practices may obscure the extent \nto which costs associated with large commercial customers, including hyperscale data \ncenters, are socialized across the broader customer base.364 Data center investments, \non their own, however, do not establish any specific affiliated interest or improper \ncoordination related to ALLETE or its operations.  \n \n \n361 Ex.

Ratemaking and Affordability \n213. The record contains extensive testimony and evidence addressing potential \nimpacts of the Acquisition on Minnesota Power’s ratemaking practices and customer \naffordability. Minnesota Power has emphasized that the Acquisition enhances its \ncommitment to fair and equitable ratemaking practices, addressing customer affordability \ncomprehensively through numerous explicit commitments and safeguards. The Company \nand the Partners have made explicit commitments designed to safeguard customers \nagainst potential negative rate impacts directly associated with the Acquisition.365 \n214. Various parties, however, expressed concerns regarding potential negative \nimpacts on customer rates and economic well-being, primarily based on generalized \napprehensions about private equity involvement. Witness Walters, for example, \nspecifically argued that private equity ownership might lead to increased customer rates \ndue to higher equity return expectations and planned capital expenditures, potentially \nimpacting affordability for both industrial and residential customers.366 Similarly, Witness \nLebens raised comparable concerns, emphasizing potential cost impacts resulting from \nthe Acquisition.367 \n215. In response to these concerns, Minnesota Power and the Partners made \ncommitments that they assert are designed to safeguard customer affordability and \naddress potential negative rate implications. They committed unequivocally not to seek \nrate recovery from Minnesota Power customers for any Acquisition-related costs.368 \n \n365 Ex.

Additionally, the Partners stipulated that any transitional costs incurred from \nthe Acquisition would only be eligible for recovery from customers if explicitly offset by \nmeasurable customer savings.371 \n217. Further testimony indicated that not all investments undertaken by \nMinnesota Power directly impact customer rates. Witness Cady elaborated on the shared \ncost-allocation mechanism involving multiple entities, particularly within the Midcontinent \nIndependent System Operator (“MISO”).372 Examples provided include the Northland \nReliability Project, Bison–Alexandria 345 kV project, Maple River–Cuyuna 345 kV Project, \nand the Iron Range–St. Louis County–Arrowhead 345 kV Project, all structured with \nshared cost allocations minimizing direct financial impacts to Minnesota Power’s \ncustomers.373 \n218. The record indicates that while most of ALLETE’s future capital needs \npertain to its regulated utility operations, the Commission’s ratemaking oversight, \ncombined with the limited rate impact of investments in nonregulated affiliates, allows the \nCompany to secure additional capital without necessarily increasing customer costs.374  \n \n369 Ex.

Witness Walters raised specific apprehensions about increased capital \nexpenditures driven by private equity, expressing concerns that higher financing costs \nmight lead to elevated rates.375 Minnesota Power clarified that none of the Company’s \nplanned capital expenditures are driven explicitly by the Acquisition itself.376 Instead, \nthese investments reflect necessary system upgrades driven by clean energy transition \ngoals, compliance with Minnesota’s Clean Energy Standard, infrastructure resilience, and \nincreased electrification needs.377 Further, all cost recovery associated with planned \ncapital expenditures are subject to additional Commission, Department, OAG, and other \ninterested party scrutiny at the time Minnesota Power seeks such cost recovery.378 \n220. Minnesota Power also addressed concerns related to dated rate projections \npresented by the OAG, noting these were prepared prior to recent rate case outcomes \nand did not accurately reflect current or future capital plans influenced by the \nAcquisition.379 According to the testimony, no witnesses identified specific new costs or \ninvestments directly attributable to the Acquisition or the Partners. \n221. Minnesota Power also provided historical data from utilities that transitioned \nfrom public to private ownership, including El Paso Electric (Texas and New Mexico), \nCLECO Power, Duquesne Light Company, and Puget Sound Energy.380 Analysis of these \nutilities demonstrated modest average rate increases post-acquisition, significantly below \nnational averages and inflation rates, thereby addressing concerns about potential rate \nhikes resulting from private ownership.381 When looking at the five investor owned electric \n \n375 Ex.

The Partners also explicitly committed to provide a significant financial \ncontribution of potentially millions of dollars aimed at substantially reducing residential \ncustomer arrears to pre-COVID-19 levels or lower.387 This commitment both enhances \nMinnesota Power’s existing CARE program and augments the flat monthly discount and \narrearage forgiveness components.388 It is an historic, investor-paid benefit to the \nCompany’s most vulnerable customers that is not available absent the Partners’ \ninvolvement.389 \n \n383 LIHEAP is the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program administered and funded by the \nfederal government. \n384 NATIONAL LOW INCOME HOUSING COALITION , Entire LIHEAP Staff at HHS Fired, Jeopardizing Distribution \nfor Home Energy Bill Assistance for Low-Income Households (April 7, 2025) , available online at \nhttps://nlihc.org/resource/entire-liheap-staff-hhs-fired-jeopardizing-distribution-home-energy-bill-\nassistance-low .

The Partners also explicitly pledged not to charge Minnesota Power fees \nfor any business management or consulting services provided,392 which ensures that \ncustomers are not burdened by potential additional administrative or overhead costs \nresulting from the Acquisition. \n226. The record also includes testimony addressing whether the Acquisition \ncould affect Minnesota Power’s authorized ROE. Parties raised concerns that private \nownership might result in higher ROE requests.393 However, Minnesota Power’s \nauthorized ROE will continue to be set by the Commission using its established \nmethodologies, which are based on the utility’s risk profile and not the identity or return \n \n390 Ex.

The record also indicates that the Company and the Partners commit that \nthe equity capital provided in support of Minnesota Power’s capital needs will not be used \nto justify any increase in the Company’s authorized ROE.395  \n228. As with any regulated utility, Minnesota Power will still be bound by the rates \nset by the Commission. That means that, just as before the Acquisition, after the \nAcquisition, the Commission will determine the appropriate rates and ROE for Minnesota \nPower and its customers based on the reasonable and prudent investments made by \nMinnesota Power and risk the Company faces on a stand-alone basis, not based on the \nowner of the Company or the source of funds it uses to operate.396 \nG. Workforce and Labor Protections \n229. To continue to provide safe, reliable, and affordable service, and satisfy the \nCarbon Free Standard, the Company needs to ensure that it has a skilled workforce. To \nprotect the Company’s workforce during the Acquisition process, the Partners and the \nCompany have provided a post-Acquisition commitment to retain the Company’s current \nworkforce for two years following the close of the Acquisition. \n230. The two-year post-Acquisition commitment from the Partners and the \nCompany applies to the entirety of the Company’s workforce and commits to retaining \nsuch workforce in either the same or better employment position in the same location with \n \n394 Ex.

This commitment is inclusive of the Company’s bargaining and non-\nbargaining employees, the Company’s senior management, and to the Company’s long-\nstanding relationship with contractors and bargaining employees.399  \n232. Department Witness Vavro expressed concern regarding the Company’s \ntwo-year post-Acquisition commitment stating that it is not a benefit, but rather a short-\nterm protection against future harm.400 The record demonstrates this commitment \nreassures every employee at every level that their employment is protected for two-years \nfollowing the close of the Acquisition.  \n233. Department Witness Vavro also expressed concern that significant changes \nmay occur to Minnesota Power’s workforce at the end of the two-year commitment.401 \nThe record does not contain any evidence to support either claim that significant changes \nwill occur to the Company’s workforce following the two-year post-Acquisition \ncommitment. The commitment to protect the Company’s workforce paired with increased \naccess to capital that will result from the Acquisition allows the Company to provide stable \nand continued employment for its workforce.  \n \n397 Ex.

Sierra Club Witness Lane similarly noted that the Partners’ workforce \ncommitments do not include an express commitment to not pressure senior management \nto voluntarily depart during the two-year post-Acquisition commitment.402 The record does \ndemonstrate that Minnesota Power’s day-to-day operations will continue to be handled \nby the Company’s senior manager team, with significant decisions continuing to be \nsubject to the approval by the ALLETE Board.403 \n235. The record also states that the Company has committed to extending its \ncontract with the IBEW Local 31 through April 30, 2028, beyond the two-year post-\nAcquisition commitment. This contract extension provides additional benefits, salary \nincreases, and job security to existing bargaining group employees and includes the \nCompany’s first-ever neutrality agreement.404  \n236. As a result of the commitments from the Company and the Partners in this \nAcquisition, local bargaining groups have voiced their support for the Acquisition. The \nparties participating in this proceeding who represent the Company’s bargaining \nworkforce, such as LIUNA, IUOE, and IBEW Local 31, have each offered their support \nfor the Acquisition because it poses minimal risks to its members and offers continued \nemployment commitments.405  \n237. LIUNA has also expressed that it expects the Acquisition to deliver net \nbenefits to its members because of the Minnesota’s strong system and culture of utility \n \n402 Ex.

The Minnesota State Building & Construction Trades Council (“Building \nTrades”) stated in their public comments that the Acquisition will “have no impact on the \nway Minnesota Power operates on a day-to-day basis, while greatly strengthening the \nutility’s capacity to attract capital and support badly needed economic growth  in its service \nterritory.”407 And as the Building Trades further elaborated, “[t]he potential consequences \nof a capital shortage are potentially severe” in that they “could create deployment delays \nthat could threaten the utility’s ability to meet requirements, maintain reliability and/or take \nadvantage of favorable market conditions and avoid unfavorable conditions.”408 The \nBuilding Trades further noted that “capital shortfalls will almost certainly result in higher \ncosts for customers by reducing competition and giving third parties more leverage to \nextract premiums in cases where the utility could have provided a more cost-effective \noption.”409  \n239. Lastly, the Partners and the Company have committed to keeping \nMinnesota Power’s headquarters in Duluth, Minnesota for as long as the Partners own \nMinnesota Power.410 Although Minnesota Power did not have plans to move its \nheadquarters prior to the merger agreement,411 this commitment ensures that the \nCompany will continue to recruit and maintain a talented workforce in Minnesota.  \n \n \n406 Ex.

Various Parties argued that a potential harm resulting from the Acquisition \nis that stakeholders will have less information about ALLETE than they currently do. The \nmain arguments made on this topic were: (a) the discontinuation of ALLETE’s Securities \nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reporting will deprive stakeholders of information \nabout ALLETE; (b) ALLETE’s and the Partners’ discovery responses were not \ntransparent, which casts doubt on their willingness to be appropriately transparent on \nfinancial issues in the future; and (c) the Commission and stakeholders will not have \nsufficient visibility into financial matters at Alloy Parent and the Partners.  \n1. Discontinuation of SEC Reporting \n241. Minnesota law provides that the Commission has access to, and can \nexamine, all of Minnesota Power’s books and finances.412 In addition, Minnesota Power \nprovides extremely detailed and wide-ranging financial information to the Commission in \nits rate cases, rider proceedings, jurisdictional annual reports and annual affiliated interest \nfilings, integrated resource planning (“IRP”) and integrated distribution planning (“IDP”) \nproceedings, annual capital structure filings, and numerous other compliance filings.413 \nAll of this information is made available to the OAG and the Department as well as the \nCommission, and nearly all of it is available to the general public. \n242. In the Petition, the Company and the Partners committed that Minnesota \nPower will continue to provide the Commission with access to its books, records, and \ninformation.414 Recognizing the Acquisition would mean that ALLETE would no longer be \nsubject to SEC reporting requirements, ALLETE and the Partners included in the Petition \n \n412 Minn.

LPI Witness Walters and Sierra Club Witness Lane argued that the \ndiscontinuation of ALLETE’s SEC reporting would mean that Minnesota Power’s \ncustomers and the Commission would have less insight into ALLETE’s finances.417 \nHowever, the scope and detail of the information already provided in, and accessible to, \nthe Commission and the public through the Company’s filings with the Commission \nexceeds the scope of financial information presented in SEC reporting.418 According to \nWitness Anderson, SEC reports such as 10-Ks are primarily intended to provide \ninformation to investors and they only address a limited number of topics, whereas the \ninformation the Company provides to the Commission is broader and addresses the \nissues that are pertinent to the Commission’s regulatory role.419 \n244. For example, Witness Walters argued that SEC filings provide information \nthat is “crucial” for regulators and ratepayers to use to assess risks that could affect the \nutility’s operations.420 However, that information will continue to be filed by Minnesota \n \n415 Ex.

The Moody’s and S&P credit rating reports for the Company, \nthe compliance filings that are required any time Minnesota Power undertakes a \nsignificant disposition or acquisition of regulated assets, and the annual capital structure \npetition each, in different ways, provide information that might be useful in assessing risk \nor pertinent to other issues that the Commission is focused on.421 \n245. Witness Lane also argued that the discontinuation of SEC reporting means \nthat critical information about the Company’s performance, strategic decisions, and \npotential risks could be obscured from public view.422 But the Company’s IRP submission \ncontains more detailed and comprehensive information about the Company’s outlook, \nmodeling, plans, and work toward the clean energy transition than would be found in an \nSEC report or on a quarterly earnings conference call.423 \n246. In Rebuttal Testimony, the Company and the Partners proposed several \nadditional measures relating to transparency of the Company’s finances: \n The Company’s annual capital structure petition will include full audited \nconsolidated financial statements for ALLETE, prepared in accordance with \nGenerally Accepted Auditing Principles (“GAAP”). These will include all of \nthe footnotes, as well as specific supplemental schedules that are currently \nincluded in ALLETE’s Forms 10-K and 10-Q.424 \n The Company’s annual capital structure petition will also include full audited \nconsolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, for \nAlloy Parent.425 \n \n421 Ex.

Discovery Disagreements \n247. Various Parties raised concerns about ALLETE’s and the Partners’ \ndiscovery responses, arguing that some were not adequately responsive, and that too \nmuch information was designated as Highly Confidential Trade Secret (“HCTS”).429 \n248. It is unsurprising that in a heatedly contested matter such as this, in which \nALLETE and the Partners responded to hundreds of discovery responses, that there will \nbe disagreements about some discovery responses. After review, it was determined that \nsome HCTS designations were appropriate and others too broad on a few documents.430  \n249. None of the Parties’ complaints about the style or nuances of ALLETE’s and \nthe Partners’ discovery responses are material to the substantive issues being addressed \n \n426 Ex.

Rather, they are the typical disputes encountered in a \nhighly contentious proceeding such as this.  \n3. Visibility into the Finances of Alloy Parent and the Partners \n250. In Surrebuttal Testimony, various Parties suggested that to ensure proper \noversight of Minnesota Power, the Commission and other stakeholders need visibility into \nthe finances of the Partners.431 \n251. However, those Parties did not cite any precedent or basis in law for the \nunregulated corporate parent of a utility to provide state regulators with unfettered access \nto its financial information. These witnesses did not identify any specific information that \nthey wanted to review that will not be available in the information the Company is \ncontinuing to provide or has agreed to provide.  \n252. The Department and other parties will receive and have access to full \ninformation about Minnesota Power’s utility operations, with many avenues in the multiple \nMinnesota Power proceedings before the Commission at any given time to request \nadditional information.  \nI. Core Values and Environmental Commitments \n253. The record includes discussion of whether the Acquisition aligns with \nMinnesota Power’s longstanding corporate values and environmental commitments. \nMinnesota Power explained that the Partners selected for the Acquisition demonstrate \nsignificant compatibility with the Company’s established operational philosophy, including \n \n431 Ex.

Concerns were raised by Witness Baker, who expressed apprehension that \nprivate equity ownership could potentially prioritize short-term financial gains at the \nexpense of local economic initiatives, established corporate values, and employee \nrelations.433 Similarly, Witness Lane raised concerns regarding the potential impacts on \nMinnesota Power’s environmental objectives, particularly questioning the Company’s \nongoing capability to meet Minnesota’s Clean Energy Standard and effectively manage \nits planned retirement of the Boswell Energy Center under new ownership.434 \n255. The Partners explained that they are committed to supporting Minnesota \nPower’s investment in the clean energy transition.435 Based on their previous experiences \nsupporting the deployment of renewable resources, the Partners indicated that they \nunderstand the magnitude of Minnesota Power’s transition and the resources required to \naccomplish this task.436 \n256. According to the Partners, their business models are oriented toward long-\nterm infrastructure investments, distinguishing them from other types of private equity \ncharacterized by short-term asset management strategies.437 Testimony from Witness \n \n432 Ex.

Furthermore, the Partners committed to maintaining Minnesota Power’s \nhistorical economic development initiatives within Minnesota for the duration of their \nownership.439 Witness Cady explained that this commitment is intended to ensure \ncontinuity in supporting local communities, maintaining employment opportunities, and \nsustaining economic growth activities historically conducted by Minnesota Power.440 \n258. Additionally, the Partners provided assurances regarding the preservation \nof Minnesota Power’s local corporate identity. Commitments included retaining the \nCompany’s headquarters in Duluth, Minnesota, and preserving existing local \nmanagement structures and operational leadership.441 Specifically, Witness Cady \nexplained that the Partners have committed to defer to Minnesota Power to maintain \nculture, relationships, and overall approach to operations.442  \n259. Witness Cady further emphasized the Partners’ transparency commitments \nthrough their agreement to continue the voluntary publication of Minnesota Power’s \nCorporate Sustainability Report, which documents the Company’s ongoing activities \nrelated to environmental stewardship, diversity, equity, and inclusion.443 While Minnesota \nPower did not have any plans to discontinue publishing this report, by continuing this \n \n438 Ex.

Regarding environmental commitments, the Partners affirmed their \ndedication to supporting Minnesota Power’s compliance with Minnesota’s Carbon Free \nStandard.445 This commitment includes adherence to regulatory oversight through the \nCommission’s Integrated Resource Planning process, reinforcing the structured \napproach to meeting environmental standards and renewable energy goals.446 \n261. The Partners articulated commitments for substantial investments in \nrenewable energy infrastructure, directly aligning with Minnesota Power’s strategic \nobjectives to accelerate renewable energy integration and comply with state-mandated \nenvironmental goals.447  \n262. Witness Cady provided testimony affirming the Partners’ demonstrated \nalignment with Minnesota Power’s core values and operational culture since the inception \nof their partnership.448 Witness Cady highlighted that the Partners have actively engaged \nwith Company employees, customers, and community leaders across Minnesota Power’s \nservice area, exemplifying their collaborative approach and commitment to addressing \nstakeholder concerns comprehensively.449 \n263.

APPROVAL BY OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES \n264. The Acquisition has undergone review in several forums, including the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and the Public Service Commission of \nWisconsin (“PSCW”).451 The Company also submitted the Hart-Scott-Rodino (“HSR”) \npremerger notification to the Federal Trade Commission and Antitrust Division of the \nJustice Department. Further, on August 21, 2024, ALLETE’s shareholders voted to \napprove the proposed Acquisition with approximately 97 percent of shareholders voting \nin favor of approving the transaction.452  \n265. The FERC reviewed this transaction under §§ 203(a)(1) and 203(a)(2) of \nthe Federal Power Act (“FPA”) to determine whether it is consistent with the public \ninterest.453 On December 19, 2024, the FERC issued an Order in Docket No. EC24-105-\n000 approving the Acquisition. The Order states, “As discussed below, we authorize the \nProposed Transaction as consistent with the public interest.”454 While the FERC defers \nto the state commissions with respect to additional regulation, no further approvals are \nrequired by the FERC. \n \n450 Id. at 20-21. \n451 The Company also anticipates filing with the Federal Communications Commission, which is expected \nto be a short process. \n452 Ex.

The PSCW proceeding in Docket No. 5820-DR-100, examined whether the \nWisconsin Utility Holding Company Act (“WUHCA”) applied and, if so, how it should guide \nthe Acquisition’s approval.455 On January 23, 2025, all parties to the PSCW’s proceeding \non this matter agreed to waive their respective rights to a contested case hearing and \nexecuted a Stipulation of Facts and Waiver of Hearing (“Stipulation”). The Stipulation was \nagreed to by all parties, including the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, IBEW Local 31, \nMadison Gas and Electric Company, Wisconsin Electric Power Company, and the \nWisconsin Public Service Corporation.456 On March 13, 2025, the PSCW orally approved \nthe transaction, subject to certain conditions, thereby removing any Wisconsin-specific \nbarriers.457 All necessary state-level approvals in Wisconsin are thus complete. No party \nto this proceeding has raised issues with respect to the Wisconsin approval. \n267. The Company was required to file notifications with the federal antitrust \nagencies under the HSR Act.458 This submission was made on January 31, 2025, \nprompting a standard waiting period that ended on March 5, 2025, without challenge or \nextension.459 With that waiting period expired, the Acquisition is free of any potential \nantitrust hurdles under the HSR requirements.   \n268. The Commission is the last approval necessary before the Acquisition can \nproceed. \n \n455 Ex. MP-9 at 10 (Cady Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-03 ). \n456 Ex.

MINNESOTA POWER’S UNION AND NON-UNION WORKFORCE \n269. The record demonstrates that Minnesota Power’s workforces will benefit \nfrom the Acquisition. The record unequivocally demonstrates that there are real and \nmeasurable benefits to the Minnesota Power workforce that will occur if the Acquisition is \napproved.  \n270. These benefits to employees are not ensured if the Acquisition is denied. \nAny potential harms are purely speculative.  \n271. The benefits of the Acquisition for Minnesota Power’s workforce are \ndiscussed in detail in Section V.H, above.  \nVIII. MINNESOTA POWER’S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE CARBON FREE \nSTANDARD \n272. The primary  goal of the Acquisition is to equip the Company with a reliable \nstream of significant additional equity capital that will allow the Company to expand its \ninvestments in clean energy technologies to comply with the Carbon Free Standard.460 \nThe Acquisition best positions the Company to satisfy the Carbon Free Standard while \nmaintaining safe, reliable, and affordable service to Minnesota Power customers.  \n273. The Company and the Partners have stated that without the Acquisition, the \nCompany’s compliance with the Carbon Free Standard may not be possible. The record \nshows that ALLETE would need to raise more than $1 billion in new equity to fund its \nexpected investment requirements over the next five years.461 In comparison, in the \nCompany’s 75-year history in publicly traded markets, the Company has raised $1.3 \nbillion in equity.462 The Company has stated that continued reliance on public markets \n \n460 Ex. MP-9 at 7 (Cady Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-03 ).  \n461 Ex. MP-28 at 7 (Scissons Rebuttal) ) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-04 ). \n462 Ex. MP-29 at 3 (Taran Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-05 ).  \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 92 of 97\n \n \n90 \n risks the Company’s ability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard because of the \ncyclicality of the public markets, public stockholders’ demands for regular quarterly \ndividends, and the price the Company can obtain on public stock issuances if it needs to \nissue large quantities on a regular basis.463  \n274. The record also demonstrates that ALLETE’s investments to comply with \nthe Carbon Free Standard will require an increase in ALLETE’s capital expenditures that \nis much larger than ALLETE’s prior capital expenditure levels. Specifically, the five-year \ninvestment plan is approximately 3.8 times larger than ALLETE’s historical average.464 \nThe majority of these anticipated investments are dedicated to solar, wind, storage \nresources, and transmission lines so as to comply with the Carbon Free Standard.465 The \nrecord shows that while ALLETE is one of the smallest utilities in the country by market \ncapitalization,466 the Company’s need for equity capital is large in proportion to its market \ncapitalization.467  \n275. Sierra Club Witness Lane expressed concern that the Acquisition could \nnegatively impact the pace and effectiveness of the Company’s compliance with the \nCarbon Free Standard.468 Department Witness Addonizio similarly stated that the \nCompany’s ability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard will depend on the Partners’ \ndesire and ability to invest in the Company.469 The record states that the Partners and the \nCompany have committed to efforts to achieve the Carbon Free Standard with the least \ncost pathways that are ultimately decided by the Commission in its orders, approved \n \n463 Ex. MP-10 at 8 (Scissons Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-04 ).  \n464 Ex. MP-11 at 5 (Taran Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-05 ).  \n465 Ex.

Sierra Club Witness Lane argued that the Partner’s commitment to supply \nadequate funding is insufficient because it does not fully guarantee the Partners will \ncomply with the Carbon Free Standard.472 The record shows the Partners and the \nCompany have committed to efforts to achieve the Carbon Free Standard and have \naffirmed to be part of the regulatory process in Minnesota and the jurisdiction of the \nCommission.473 Further, regardless of any commitments, the Carbon Free Standard is \nstate law and the Partners and the Company have provided explicit affirmation to the \nCommission’s determinations regarding resource planning, distribution planning, \nresource acquisition decisions, and efforts to achieve the Carbon Free Standard.474 \n277. Department Witness Addonizio expressed the possibility that if the Partners \nsell Alloy Parent and ALLETE prior to 2040, it would result in the new owners or ownership \nplaying an important role in compliance with the Carbon Free Standard.475 Sierra Club \nWitness Lane shared this concern and further stated that the Partners did not make any \ncommitment to maintain its ownership of Minnesota Power for any specific period of \ntime.476 The record demonstrates that the Partners’ business model is not oriented toward \nshort-term asset flipping, but rather towards long-term, infrastructure based investments \n \n470 Ex.

The record also demonstrates that the Company will continue use power \npurchase agreements as a tool to meet future resource needs and comply with the \nCarbon Free Standard.478 The Company currently uses power purchases agreements, \nbut the ultimate approval to either enter into a power purchase agreement or construct \nutility owned resources will be set up through Commission-approved competitive bid \nprocesses and resource-planning determinations.479  \n279. No intervening party raised issues in this proceeding regarding the \nAcquisition’s potential impacts on the Nemadji Trail Energy Center. Company Witness \nCady stated that the Acquisition does not change the Commission’s oversight of the \nCompany and the Company will remain fully regulated by the Commission.480 The \nCommission will continue to have oversight over the Company’s resource decisions \nthrough the Integrated Resource Plan, resource acquisition dockets, and cost recovery \nproceedings.  \n280. The record supports the Company’s position that the Acquisition will aid the \nCompany’s ability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard.  \nIX. CONSISTENCY WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST \n281. The record establishes that the Acquisition is consistent with the public \ninterest and should be approved, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 216B.50.  \n \n477 Ex.

Minnesota Power and the Partners have presented numerous benefits of \nthe Acquisition, reinforced by specific, concrete commitments. The other parties to this \nproceeding have not identified any additional conditions that are necessary for the \nAcquisition to be consistent with the public interest. When pressed for actual conditions \nthat the agencies or intervenors wanted to address their “potential” concerns with the \nAcquisition,481 witnesses affirmatively stated they had not proposed any or could not \narticulate any for the record.482  \n283. The evidence submitted by Minnesota Power and the Partners in this case \nshows that the Acquisition will not result in adverse impacts on customers, service cost \nor quality, employees, or communities.483 The Partners are also not seeking to change \nMinnesota Power’s operations.484 Further, the Acquisition will not reduce the level of \ninvestments or service or fundamentally change cost structures or long-term plans for \nMinnesota Power.485 \n284. Despite a lack of record evidence of such adverse impacts, to demonstrate \ntheir commitment to each other, to the Company’s stakeholders and regulatory \nprocesses, and to State policy, the Company and the Partners developed a significant \nnumber of commitments in the form of affirmative benefits to customers, protections \nagainst perceived concerns, and affirmations of ongoing practices.486 These \n \n481 The exception is found in Witness Vavro’s proposals for an impractical non-consolidation opinion and \nunnecessary restructuring of ALLETE itself, which have undesirable implications. \n482 Evid.

The Acquisition offers an opportunity for Minnesota Power to partner with \nglobal leaders in infrastructure deployment who share Minnesota Power’s vision and \nvalues and who can provide reliable, patient, and flexible capital without the risks \nassociated with the public markets. This Acquisition will also allow Minnesota Power’s \ninvestors to be more closely aligned with employee, customer, and stakeholder needs as \ncompared to the current large number of public investors. \n2. The additional commitments proposed by Minnesota Power and the \nPartners in the Merger Agreement, in the Petition, and during the pendency of this \nproceeding are reasonable for the Acquisition and no additional conditions are necessary \nbased on the record.  \n3. Under the standard of review required by Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, the record \ndemonstrates that the Acquisition is consistent with the public interest. \n \nPetitioners’ Exceptions\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198\nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nAttachment D\nPage 97 of 97"

In rate case proceedings, regulatory agencies generally attempt to set\nrates for utility service that reflect a reasonable estimate of the utility’s cost of service,\nreferred to as a “revenue requirement.” A revenue requirement is the approximate\namount of money that a utility needs to collect from customers to pay all costs of\nservice including a reasonable return for its investors. It can be expressed using the\nformula shown below.6\n6. Companies, including utilities, fund their operations with a mix of\nshort-term debt, long-term debt, and equity. Each type of financing has a different levelI. BACKGROUND\nA. Utility Financing\n1. Electric utilities are capital-intensive businesses. The provision of safe\nand reliable utility service requires significant amounts of long-lived physical\ninfrastructure. Transmission lines, for example, may remain in service for 60 years or\nlonger, and wind turbines have 25- to -3535-year operating lives.1\n2. Utilities recover the costs of these assets from ratepayers over the assets’\noperating life, rather than upfront. Because utilities cannot fund new capital projects\nwith money provided by ratepayers, they must obtain the needed capital from investors.\nFunds sourced from capital markets bridge the gap between when utilities need capital\nto pay for a new project, and when ratepayers pay for the project.2\n3. Investors typically will onlynot provide capital when unless  the utility offers\na sufficient return on that capital. The return compensates the investor for the\nopportunity cost of forgoing alternative spending and for assuming the risk associated\nwith the investment.3\n4. Rates of return are to bedetermined by the forces of supply and demand\nin competitive environments.4 Because utilities are not subject to market competition,\nregulatory agencies must set prices and rates of return that ensure utilities provide an\nappropriate supply of satisfactory services at reasonable rates.5\n1 Ex.

The overall required rate of return for a company is the average of the\nrequired rate of return for each of these financing sources, weighted by the amount of\neach financing type the utility uses, and is otherwise known as the weighted average\ncost of capital (WACC), or just the “cost of capital.” The table below presents the\ncomponents of the overall rate of return approved in Minnesota Power’s most recent\nrate case as an example.8\n8. The right  balance  between Balancing  short-term debt, long-term debt, and\nequity requires a company to consider competing factors. Interest and principal\npayments on debt are fixed obligations and are prioritized over payments to equity\ninvestors. Due to this extra certainty for debt investors, the cost of debt capital is lower\nthan the cost of equity capital. Further, interest payments on debt are tax deductible,of associated risk, and therefore, investors require  ademand  a different rate of return\nfor each. Short-term debt is the least risky for investors, and as a result has the lowest\nrequired rate of return. Equity is the riskiest of the three and has the highest required\nrate of return. Long-term debt falls between the other two.7\n7 Ex. DOC-303 at 14 (Addonizio Direct)  (eDocket  No. 20252-214941-01);  see also Ex.\nMP-11 at 10 (Taran Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-05) .\n8 Ex.

For these reasons, debt\nmight seem like a more attractive option to a company raising capital.9\n9. As a company’s debt load grows, however, so do its fixed payment\nobligations. As the company’s fixed obligations grow, so does the risk that adverse\ncircumstances will prevent the company from meeting those obligations. Debt  adds\nfinancial risk due to the obligation to make interest payments, which places pressure on \ncredit  ratings. A failure to make a required interest or principal payment could trigger a\ncostly bankruptcy, which could result in a complete loss of value for equity investors,\nand significant losses for debt investors. Investors will be aware of these risks and will\nrequire higher returns on both debt and equity as the proportion of debt financing\nincreases. As a result, there is a limit on the amount of debt a company can have\nbefore the costs associated with an incremental increase in debt risk start to outweigh\nthe benefits of its lower cost and tax advantages.10\n10. While every company has a theoretical, cost-minimizing capital structure,\nit is impossible to determine that structure with precision. As a result, these concepts\nare generally applied at a high level in utility regulation to ensure that utilities do not use\nexcessive levels of debt or equity.11\nB. Public Versus Privately Held Companies\n11. A publicly traded company is an entity whose equity securities are owned\nby many investors and listed on a national securities exchange under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.12\n12. Publicly traded companies are required to regularly file reports with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission ( “SEC”),13 including Form 10-Qs (quarterly\nreports) and Form 10-Ks (annual reports), which collectively provide a comprehensive,\nregularly updated view of the company’s overall financial performance and strategic\ndirection.14 These filings include consolidated financial statements, management’s\ndiscussion and analysis, risk factors, and forward-looking statements that help\nstakeholders—including regulators—understand the company’s financial health,\nbusiness strategy, and potential risks.15\n9 Ex.

Privately held companies do not file the same reports with the SEC that\nare required of publicly traded companies.16\nC. ALLETE\n14. ALLETE is a publicly traded company focused on energy and utility\nservice. It was founded as the Duluth-Edison Electric Company in 1906. ALLETE\nchanged its name several times before adopting its current name in 2001.17 In its\ncurrent form, an independent board of directors, meeting the New York Stock\nExchange’s independence standards, governs the company.18 ALLETE’s stock was first\nlisted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1950.19\n15. As shown below, ALLETE does business through its operating divisions\nand subsidiaries. Under the trade name “Minnesota Power,” ALLETE provides\nregulated electric service in northeast Minnesota. A subsidiary, Superior Water, Light &\nPower Company, provides electric, gas, and water service in Wisconsin.20 Through\nother subsidiaries, ALLETE Clean Energy and New Energy Equity, ALLETE develops\nindependent power projects.21 Through BNI Energy, ALLETE mines coal.22 ALLETE\nalso holds a stake in American Transmission Company.23\n15 Ex.

ALLETE’s primary business is providing rate-regulated electric service in\nnortheast Minnesota. ALLETE has about 150,000 electric ratepayers in Minnesota.25\nMost of its revenue, however, comes from a handful of large industrial customers.Figure 124\n24 Ex. MP-1, Attach.

ALLETE’s overall financial health is strong. In 2024, net income\nattributable to ALLETE’s core regulated operations increased from $147.2 million in\n2023 to $160.9 million in 2024.27 Higher electricity rates in Minnesota drove the revenue\nincrease.28 In February 2025, ALLETE reported that it hoped to make  about achieve\napproximately  $5 billion in capital expenditures between 2025 and 2029. ALLETE\ncommented that it was “well positioned to meet [its] financing needs due to adequate\noperating cash flows, available additional working capital and access to capital\nmarkets.”29 ALLETE explained that it planned to “finance capital expenditures from a\ncombination of internally generated funds, debt and equity issuance proceeds.”30\n18. As it plans its future operations, ALLETE must consider the Carbon Free\nStandard. ByAbsent  Commission  modification,  by 2030 ALLETE must generate or\nprocure an equivalent of 80 %percent  of its electricity sales to retail customers from a\ncarbon-free source. That percentage increases to 90 %percent  in 2035 and 100 %\npercent  in 2040.31 ALLETE appears to be on track to meet these requirements.\nALLETE was the first Minnesota utility to surpass the milestone of providing 50 %\npercent  renewable energy to customers.32\nD. Private Equity  Managers\n19. Private equity firms often raise capital from investors in commingled\nclosed-ended funds with fixed lengths.33 Once a private equity firm has raised a\nclosed-ended fund, it will then seek to invest substantially all the fund’s capital in\ncompanies within four to five years, which become part of the fund’s portfolio.34 Once\nthe fund’s investment period ends, the firm will generally have little ability to make new\nor follow-on investments in the fund’s portfolio companies.35\n20. Private equity firms typically seek to grow the portfolio company’s value\nduring a four-to-six-year hold period before selling it or taking it public through an initial\npublic offering.36 Private equity firms typically seek returns that exceed the stock\nmarket. Private equity firms focus on growing cash flows by increasing portfolio\n26 Evid. Hr. Tr. Vol. 1 at 173:7-18 (Cady).\n27 Ex. MP-45 at 44 (ALLETE 2024 Form 10-K).\n28 Ex.

To achieve above-market investor returns, private equity firms often rely\non “financial engineering.”39 Financial engineering involves manipulating the portfolio\ncompany’s capital structure.40 For example, private equity firms may engage in\n“dividend recapitalization” by adding debt to their portfolio companies’ balance sheets\nand then using the proceeds to collect dividends for themselves.41 Additionally, private\nequity firms may “double leverage” the portfolio company by having a holding company\nissue debt and then reinvest that debt in the portfolio company as equity. This\narrangement imposes the debt financing costs on the portfolio company while depriving\nit of the tax advantages.42 The portfolio company is typically responsible for paying back\nthe debt, not the private equity firm.43\n22. In addition to financial engineering, private equity firms may engage in\n“governance engineering” or “operational engineering” to maximize returns.\nGovernance engineering involves replacing management and restructuring\ncompensation to align the manager incentives with investor interests.44 Operational\nengineering refers to altering the portfolio company’s business practices to increase\nrevenue.45\nE. The Partners\n23. Global  Infrastructure  Partners  (“GIP”)  and  Canadian  Pension  Plan\nInvestment  Board  (“CPPIB”) GIP and  CPP  are large private equity investors.

Before the proposed acquisition can close, approvals are needed from the\nMinnesota Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the\nPublic Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW).147145\n67. FERC issued an order approving the proposed acquisition in December\n2024.148146 In approving the acquisition, FERC clarified that “whether the Proposed\nAcquisition fulfills the respective state requirements for Minnesota Commission and\nWisconsin Commission approval is a separate question from whether the Proposed\nAcquisition is consistent with the public interest under [the Federal Power Act (FPA)]\nsection 203, and our findings under FPA section 203 do not affect those agencies’\nevaluation of the Proposed Acquisition pursuant to their respective statutory\nauthorities.”149147\n68. Prior to approving the ALLETE-GIP-CCPIB ALLETE-GIP-CCP  deal, FERC\napproved BlackRock’s $12.5 billion acquisition of GIP.150148 In a concurring opinion\naccompanying that approval, FERC Chairman Christie expressed concerns about the\npower that “huge asset managers, like BlackRock” will wield when seeking to acquire\ninterests in public utilities.151149 He then specifically called on “ all utility regulators[]” to\nheed their responsibility “to make sure that [investor return] is not being needlessly\nextracted from consumers’ pockets through exercises of market power or other forms of\nrent-seeking.”152150\n69. Chairman Christie issued a similar warning in a concurring opinion\naccompanying a FERC order approving the extension of BlackRock’s “blanket\nauthorization” to acquire voting securities of any public utility:\nI have expressed my concern in the past about the specter of a huge\nasset manager, such as BlackRock, using its substantial holdings to exert\ncontrol over the operational decisions of a public utility. Owning 20 %\npercent , or even less than that, of a utility’s stock could well result in the\nexercise of substantial influence over a utility. So it is imperative that we\ncarefully review requests under section 203 of the Federal Power Act to\nextend asset managers’ blanket authorizations.\n147145 Ex.

Finally, Intervenors say that \nALLETE could pursue slower dividend growth\nand reinvestment in retained earnings to reduce its capital needs.166 Xcel Energy, Inc. is\nan example of one utility that has begun slowing its rate of dividend growth to reinvest.\nPaying out less in dividends would leave more cash available to fund any needed\nclean-energy investments.167\n77\n79\n. Given these opportunities to reduce capital spending, Intervenors\n argue\nthat\nALLETE’s capital need projections are likely overstated.168 ALLETE has\nconsistently overestimated its capital needs each year since 2019.169 Since 2019,\nALLETE has annually overestimated its capital expenditures by [NOT PUBLIC DATA\nBEGINS . . . 170 \n. . .

Intervenors dispute\nevidence\n disputing\n ALLETE’s claims  is\n more\n credible\n.\nFirst, Intervenors\n point\n out\n that\nALLETE itself acknowledges there are no previous\ninstances where it was unable to access capital from the public market when it needed\nto, given its size and customer base.177 This past success is consistent with a major\nreason that companies seek to become publicly traded: “to raise capital and potentially\nbroaden opportunities for future access to capital.”178 ALLETE provided no quantitative\nanalysis of the difficulty or risk of financing its capital needs in the public market.179\nIntervenors\n also\n assert\n that\n the\nThe\n idea that the public market cannot meet Minnesota\nPower’s capital needs (versus ALLETE’s needs more broadly) is contradicted by [NOT\nPUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . . \n. . . NOT PUBLIC\nHCTS DATA ENDS].180\n81\n83\n. Second, Intervenors\n assert\n that\nALLETE’s professed\ndoubts about public\nmarket adequacy conflict with statements made to investors in its \nannual SEC filings. In\nits 2023 annual report, ALLETE told investors that it had adequate access to capital\nmarkets.181 Most recently, in its 2024 annual report filed in February 2025, ALLETE\nagain confirmed that it is “well positioned to meet our financing needs due to . . . access\nto capital markets.”182 Both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings were signed by ALLETE’s\nChief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and every member of ALLETE’s Board\nof Directors.183\n82\n84\n.

Fourth, Intervenors  contend  that ALLETE’s claims  ofconcerns about\nmispricing events lack support. They Intervenors explain that mispricing events fall into\nthree categories: (a) single-company events, (b) broad stock market moves affecting\nmost publicly traded stocks, and (c) significant emergency events.185\na. Single-company events are unlikely to prevent ALLETE from\naccessing capital. Sound financial theory establishes that a stock’s\nprice usually reflects equity valuation fundamentals over the long\nrun.186 In short, investors place far more importance on a\ncompany’s economic fundamentals than on reported earnings.187\nMarket evidence further establishes that no significant gap exists\nbetween a company’s value and its stock-market value, and that\nany gap can be explained by a company’s historical performance\nrelative to its peers or by the way the market is valuing an entire\nindustry.188 If the public market were highly inefficient, investors\nwould buy the affected stocks when their prices dipped, earning\nexcess returns as the stock prices rebounded. But public market\ninvestors rarely earn returns exceeding passive market\nbenchmarks. Most active investors underperform the market. An\nS&P Global study, for example, found that more than 90 %percent\nof actively managed U.S. equity funds have underperformed a\npassively managed benchmark during both the past ten years and\nthe past three years.189\nb. Becoming a private company will not help ALLETE access capital\nduring a broad market downturn. Privately held companies may\neven have less access to capital during broad market downturns\nthan publicly traded ones.190 Capital typically flows into investments\nthat provide the highest expected risk-adjusted returns.191 If a\n184 Ex.

Finally, emergency events like the COVID-19 pandemic’s onset\ncould make it difficult for both public and privately owned\ncompanies to access equity.194 Companies guard against these\ntypes of events with credit facilities.195 Companies pay significant\nfees and premiums to banks for the right to require banks to\nprovide cash on demand.196 If a company were planning a stock\nsale when such an event occurred, its credit facility should provide\nenough temporary liquidity to delay the sale until the capital\nmarkets recover.197 If a significant emergency event persisted, then\ncapital-expenditure plans would need to be reevaluated anyway.198\n84. The Administrative  Law  Judge  finds  that 86. ALLETE has not\nestablished that there is a significant risk that the public markets will be unable to meet\nits probable capital needs. The repeated overestimates and discretionary nature of\nsome of ALLETE’s plans suggest that the equity ALLETE needs to meet Minnesota’s\n2040 carbon  free law is less than the utility claims. And ALLETE has historically been\nable to meet its capital needs through the public markets. Even assuming that ALLETE\nhas accurately forecasted its equity needs, its needs would be broadly consistent with\nother publicly traded utilities that plan to meet their needs through the public equity\nmarkets. Intervenors also presented persuasive market research and accepted financial\ntheory establishing that public markets will more likely than not provide ALLETE with\nadequate access to equity capital.\nB. Access to Expertise\n8587. The Petitioners also argue that the Partners’ “deep industry expertise with\nrespect to utility and energy infrastructure and renewables” is a benefit of the proposed\nacquisition.199 Intervenors found the Partners’ expertise to have negligible benefits\nbecause it was unsupported by any concrete examples, ALLETE already has quality,\n192 Ex.

Intervenors also raised  concerns  that  the presented  evidence  that\nPartners’ expertise could be a risk rather than a benefit because the Partners will\ncontrol all of ALLETE’s strategic decisions, identified in a confidential term sheet\nbetween the Partners.201 Intervenors expressed concern that the Partners would use\ntheir expertise and extensive authority to benefit affiliates enact governance, financial,\nor operational changes intended to maximize their near-term return at the expense of\nALLETE’s long-term health.202\n8789. The Administrative Law Judge finds that the Partners’ expertise is unlikely\nto provide a material benefit to Minnesota Power or its ratepayers. ALLETE already has\nquality management and “near perfect” reliability for its electric service.203 Further, while \nthe Partners’  expertise  could  benefit  ratepayers  to the extent  that it helps  mitigate  rate\nincreases, the acquisition is more likely to lead to higher rates rather than lower rates\nfor reasons discussed below.\nC. Proposed Commitments\n8890. Petitioners have provided a schedule memorializing various commitments\npertaining to how ALLETE would be governed following an acquisition.204 The schedule,\nattached to the rebuttal testimony of Jennifer Cady, lists 48 commitments, including\nsome commitments that were originally made in the merger agreement, the\npetition Petition , or Petitioners’ direct testimony and others as well as other commitments\nthat are new as of rebuttal.205\n8991.

Commitment 1 does not fully address the concerns in the record already\nnoted  that Minnesota Power may fail to improve ALLETE’s access to capital. First,\nALLETE recently advised investors that it could adequately meet its capital needs for\nthis same five-year period in the public markets.207 Second, the Commitment is on\nbehalf of Alloy Parent, not the Partners.208 The Partners would have an indirect\nownership interest in Alloy Parent, but they have not committed to hold that interest for\nany period,209 nor has Alloy Parent committed to hold ALLETE for any period. Third, a\nfive-year capital commitment cannot alone fund Minnesota Power’s efforts to achieve\nthe energy transition because that transition will extend beyond five years.210 Fourth,\nthe commitment Commitment  can be met by deferral or reinvestment of dividends,\nwhich is something ALLETE can do without going private.211 Fifth, nothing in the\ncommitment Commitment  prevents ALLETE from borrowing the funds for any equity\ninfusions, and any additional debt in ALLETE and Alloy Parent’s capital structure would\nincrease upward pressure on ALLETE’s cost of debt.212 Finally, the\ncommitment Commitment  does not guarantee that new equity infusions will be provided\nat a reasonable cost. Instead, the commitment Commitment  states that it “will not be\nused to establish a higher or lower [return on equity].”213 This leaves substantial\nuncertainty about the future cost of equity that Minnesota Power’s ratepayers will pay\nfor the Partners’ capital.\n9193. Commitment 2 states, “Minnesota Power will provide compliance filings on\nequity infusions from and dividends to Alloy Parent in the same manner that the\nCompany currently provides compliance filings in its capital structure docket.”214\nCommitment 2 does not provide any benefit because Minnesota Power is required by\nlaw to provide this information in capital-structure filings.215\n9294. Commitment 3 states, “ALLETE will not make any dividend or distribution\nthat would cause the actual equity ratio of Minnesota Power to be outside the range\napproved by the Commission.”216 Commitment 3 does not provide any benefit because\nALLETE and Minnesota Power are required to maintain the equity ratio range approved\nby the Commission regardless of whether the acquisition is approved.217\n207 Ex.

Commitment 4 states, “The Company commits to not make any dividend\nor distributions unless at least one senior unsecured credit rating is investment grade or\nabove.”218 Commitment 4 would provide the Partners with an incentive to maintain at\nleast one investment-grade senior unsecured credit rating for ALLETE but would not\nrequire it. Moreover, Commitment 4 would still allow ALLETE to issue dividends if its\nother senior unsecured credit ratings were below investment grade. At best,\nCommitment 4 is therefore a weak protection against cost-of-debt increases.\n9496. Commitment 5 states, “If Minnesota Power’s cost of debt increases above\ncurrent levels within three years following the close of the Acquisition, Minnesota\nratepayers will be held harmless from any rate impact unless Minnesota Power can\ndemonstrate that its increased cost of debt was not caused by the Acquisition.”219\nCommitment 5 is a weak something  of a concession  because  any ; however,  its\ntime-limited nature severely diminishes its value. Any  impact to Minnesota Power’s cost\nof debt from the acquisition is unlikely to materialize in a significant way within three\nyears of the acquisition closing.220\n9597. Commitment 6 states, “ALLETE will use commercially reasonable efforts\nto maintain its current corporate and facility ratings.”221 Commitment 7 similarly states,\n“ALLETE will use commercially reasonable efforts to remain rated by at least two credit\nrating agencies.”222 Commitments 6 and 7 provide little benefit because ALLETE has\nnot established what “commercially reasonable” efforts are in either context or that it\nwould be reasonable not to use “commercially reasonable” efforts.223\n9698. Commitment 8 states, “With respect to ALLETE and the parent entities up\nthrough the Partners, ALLETE will maintain certain corporate separateness (i.e. “ring\nfencing”) commitments with respect to the parent and other upstream entities, as set\nforth in Schedule 3 to the Direct Testimony of Ellen Lapson.”224Commitment 8 provides \nlittle protection  against  the risks  raised  by Intervenors. ALLETE uses “ring fencing” to\nrefer to accounting measures and other corporate policies designed to prevent ALLETE\nfrom being drawn into bankruptcy if upstream entities experience financial distress.225\nThis ring  fencing  is a necessary  measure  given  the new  risks  the Acquisition’s\ncorporate  structure  creates  for ALLETE.  Bankruptcy  of ALLETE  would  be catastrophic,\nand the Partners  proposed  measures  would  decrease,  but not eliminated,  that risk.  But\nCommitment  8 provides  little  protection  against  many  of the other  risks  raised  by\nIntervenors. The proposed ring-fencing measures , however,  are not adequate to fully\n218 Ex.

Commitment 9 states that Alloy Parent will not use utility assets to\nguarantee Alloy Parent debt.227 Commitment 10 similarly states that Minnesota Power\nwill be prohibited from loaning funds to or borrowing funds from its Alloy parent or other\nupstream entities.228 Commitments 9 and 10 attempt to protect against the risks of the\nacquisition by maintaining the status quo.229 But these commitments would not prevent\nthe Partners from using ALLETE’s shares to guarantee Alloy Parent’s debt.230 They\nalso do not insulate Minnesota Power’s ratepayers from higher debt costs resulting\nfrom exposure to the risks of debt held at Alloy Parent.231\n98100. Commitments 11–14 relate to ALLETE’s post-acquisition board of\ndirectors:\na. Commitment 11 states, “In addition to the ALLETE CEO, the\nALLETE board will include two independent members, with one\nmember from Minnesota and one member from Wisconsin, each of\nwhom will be a voting member.”232\nb. Commitment 12 states that the ALLETE CEO’s board seat will not\ncount as the director from the State of Minnesota or State of\nWisconsin on the post-acquisition Board of Directors.233\nc. Commitment 13 states that the CEO of ALLETE will be a voting\nmember of the post-acquisition ALLETE board of directors.234\nd.

Commitments 11–14 11 through  14 do little to address risks related\nto the Partners’ control of ALLETE’s board.236 Although three directors (including the\nCEO) would be independent, all directors would be appointed by the Partners.237 The\nPartners, through their consent rights over material actions and their right to appoint\nboard members, would fully control the board and therefore Minnesota Power.238 If\nconflicts were to arise between the interests of Minnesota Power and its ratepayers and\nthe interests of the Partners, the utility perspective might not be sufficiently\nconsidered.239\n100102. Commitments 15 and 16 pertain to affiliated interests:\na. Commitment 15 states, “Minnesota Power will require all suppliers,\nand any industrial customers with contracted rates, to identify\nannually whether they are more than 5 %percent  owned by CPPIB,\nGIP, or Blackrock BlackRock . Minnesota Power will list those\nentities in the annual affiliated interest report.”240\nb.

Commitments 17 and 18 state that the Company will not attempt to\nrecover transaction or transition costs from utility customers.244 Commitments 17 and\n18 would not provide affirmative benefits; they merely  purport  toprevent ratepayers\nfrom paying costs that would not have been incurred absent ALLETE’s decision to\npursue a sale.\n103105. Commitments 19–21 19 through  21 pertain to pertain to certain\nprotections for, or assistance to, low-income customers and reflect an agreement that\nALLETE and the Partners reached with Energy CENTS Coalition:245\na. Commitment 19 states that there will be no reduction in Minnesota\nPower’s affordability program (CARE program) budget or the\ncurrent CARE program eligibility process for the duration of the\nPartners’ ownership of ALLETE.246\nb. Commitment 20 states that the Partners will provide a financial\ncontribution of up to $3.5 million to reduce residential arrears to\npre-COVID-19 balances or lower.247\nc. Commitment 21 states that “Minnesota Power and the Partners\naffirm their understanding that the budget billing provisions in\nMinnesota Statutes § 216B.098, subdivisions 2 and 3, refer to all\nresidential customers and is not limited to those who are formally\nincome-qualified.”248\n104106. Commitments 19 and 21 do not reflect a change from the status\nquo and thus are not benefits of the acquisition.249 The CARE program is a\nratepayer-funded program subject to ongoing Commission review.250 The Commission\nhas consistently allowed Minnesota Power to recover through rates the administrative\ncosts of the CARE program.251 Also, the affordability discount component of the CARE\nprogram is currently closed to new applicants, meaning it is no longer available to\neligible, but not previously enrolled , customers who pay more than 3 %percent  of their\nannual income on Minnesota Power electric bill.252 With regard to Commitment 20, a\n243 Evid.

Commitment 22 states that ALLETE’s contributions to the\nMinnesota Power Foundation will not be reduced while Minnesota Power is owned by\nthe Partners.254 Commitment 22 would not be a change from the status quo, and\nALLETE did not have plans to reduce its contributions to the Minnesota Power\nfoundation Foundation  before entering into the merger agreement.255 Moreover,\nratepayers currently bear 50 % percent  of these costs,256 and the\ncommitment Commitment  does not offer to reduce that burden.\n106108. Commitment 23 states that Minnesota Power will not seek rate\nrecovery of flotation costs beginning with its next rate case and continuing as long as\nthe Partners own Alloy.257 Flotation costs are the costs of issuing shares, and there is\nno evidence that ALLETE would incur flotation costs after a take-private acquisition.258\nMinnesota Power currently recovers flotation costs as part of its regulated return on\nequity (ROE).259 Post-acquisition, Minnesota Power’s ROE would still be calculated just\nas it is now.260 Commitment 23 does not offer a specific reduction in regulated ROE or\nrates to reflect the removal of the flotation costs currently included in the ROE.\nTheWhile  Commitment  23 is in the public  interest,  the ultimate  benefit of Commitment\n23 is therefore uncertain.\n107109. Commitment 24 states that Minnesota Power will not seek rate\nrecovery of investor relations costs beginning with its next rate case and continuing as\nlong as the Partners own Alloy.261 There is no evidence that Minnesota Power would\nincur investor relations costs post-acquisition.262 Minnesota Power currently recovers\n50%percent  of its investor relations costs, or $174,000 per year, from ratepayers.263 A\nsavings of $174,000 per year is in the public  interest,  but isnot a meaningful ratepayer\nbenefit compared to the risks of the acquisition.\n108110.

Commitment  25would maintain the status quo and thus is not a benefit of\nthe proposed acquisition.265 There is no evidence that any business management or\nconsulting services that the Partners might provide to ALLETE or Minnesota Power\nwould benefit ratepayers.\n109111. Commitment 26 states that Minnesota Power will not request rate\nrecovery of board compensation or expenses for any board member not independent of\nthe Partners.266 Commitment 26 would provide a rate-related benefit by preventing\nratepayers from paying board compensation and expenses for the non-independent\nboard members. Currently, ratepayers cover about half of Minnesota Power’s board\ncompensation and expenses, but the amount is not in the record.267 The dollar savings\nassociated with Commitment 26 is also not in the record , nor is there  evidence  that.\nEliminating  board  compensation  and  expenses  is in the public  interest;  however,  the\nrecord does not reflect whether  it would be a meaningful benefit  to ratepayers .\n110112. Commitment 27 states, “The Company will have the burden to\nprove in its next rate case that no transaction costs, nor the costs identified in the\nRatemaking section of this proposal for exclusion from future rate cases, are included\nin the cost of service to be recovered from customers.”268Commitment  27 is not a\nbenefit  but attempts  to prevent  ratepayers  from  bearing  costs  associated  with  the\nacquisition,  consistent  with the status  quo. Minnesota Power already has the burden of\nproof in rate cases, including the burden to prove that unreasonable costs are not being\nrecovered in rates.269\n111113. Commitment 28 states that ALLETE will maintain its current senior\nmanagement team subject to changes to account for voluntary departures or\nterminations in the ordinary course.270 Commitment 28 would maintain the status quo\nand thus is not a benefit of the proposed acquisition. There is no evidence that ALLETE\nhad plans to remove any members of its senior management team before entering into\nthe merger agreement.271Additionally,  this commitment  does  not include  an express\ncommitment  not to pressure  or encourage  senior  management  to voluntarily  depart\nduring the two-year post-Acquisition period.272\n112114.

Minnesota Power did not have plans to remove any\nnonunion employees or reduce their compensation or benefits before entering into the\nmerger agreement. Minnesota Power also had no plans not to honor existing collective\nbargaining agreements before entering into the merger agreement.273274 The\ntime-limited nature of this Commitment diminishes its illusory value even further.\n113115. Commitment 30 states that neither the Company nor the Partners\nintend to change Minnesota Power’s longstanding practices with regard to\ncontractors.274275 Commitment 30 would maintain the status quo and thus is not a\nbenefit of the proposed acquisition. Minnesota Power had no plans to change its\nlongstanding practices with regard to contractors before it entered into the merger\nagreement.275276\n114116. Commitments 31–33 reflect an agreement that Minnesota Power\nreached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 31.276277\nThese commitments provide benefits to Minnesota Power’s union workforce that\nMinnesota Power may not have been able to offer absent the proposed\nacquisition.277278\n115117.

Commitments 36–48 are styled as “affirmations of the regulatory\ncompact.”282283 Generally, they promise to maintain the status quo and do not represent\naffirmative benefits.\n118120. Commitment 36 states that “rate recovery and allocation of rate\nrecovery of Minnesota Power capital investments across customer classes are subject\nto Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”) authority.”283284 This is true\nwhether or not the acquisition occurs.284285\n119121. Commitment 37 states that “ALLETE’s capital structure will be\nmaintained within the range approved by the Commission in the annual capital structure\nfiling, and Minnesota Power will continue its efforts to manage its capital structure to the\nlevel approved in its most recent Minnesota rate case” and that “[s]o long as Minnesota\nPower and ALLETE remain the same entity, the Company will continue to make its\nannual capital structure filings with the Commission.”285286 Commitment 37 is not a\nbenefit because the Commission sets Minnesota Power’s capital structure by order,\nand ALLETE is required to maintain that capital structure.286287\n120122.

As discussed below, theythe Intervenors  assert that the Partners may\nprioritize other investments instead or make little new equity capital available.\n1. Inadequate Capital Investment\n131133. Intervenors challenged ALLETE’s assumption that the Partners will\nfund its capital plan absent a binding capital commitment. ALLETE’s chief financial\nofficer acknowledged that “investment 101” dictates that the Partners’ willingness to\ninvest additional capital in the future depends on the alternatives. Despite this\nacknowledgment, he expressed certainty that the Partners would make capital available\nto ALLETE absent a binding commitment.311Intervenors  assert  that  this317This\n314 Evid. Hrg.

In addition, Intervenors\n raise\n the\n possibility\n that\nthe Partners may\nhave inadequate capital to provide ALLETE. Post-transaction, ALLETE will be\nsolely\nentirely\n dependent on Alloy Parent, a holding company created by the Partners,\nfor equity capital. Alloy Parent, in turn, will generally have three potential sources of\ncapital: debt issuance proceeds, GIP equity capital, and CPPIB equity capital. If Alloy\nParent were in a distressed situation, and the Partners were unable or unwilling to\nprovide equity capital to Alloy Parent, Intervenors explain that \nALLETE would largely be\ncut off from financing.314\n320\n The Partners acknowledge this possibility.

Despite 137. Additionally,  despite  ALLETE’s stated clean energy-driven\nrationale for the acquisition, ALLETE is planning significant capital spending on fossil\nfuels. ALLETE’s 2025-2039 Integrated Resource Plan ( “IRP”) proposes to add over\n1,000 megawatts of new natural gas generating capacity.337329 The IRP proposes\nconverting Boswell Unit 3 to natural gas by the end of 2029 and considers two refueling\noptions for Boswell Unit 4: a 40 %percent  methane gas refuel by 2030 or cofiring with\nbiomass and natural gas by 2035.338330 If ALLETE and Partners over-invest in gas-fired\ngeneration, this could jeopardize ALLETE’s transition to clean energy  and  place\nratepayers at risk of funding additional projects .\n139.

Risks to ALLETE’s Long-Term Financial Health\n1. Financial Engineering\n140\n139\n.

Intervenors state that\nthese tactics could be detrimental to ALLETE’s long-term financial health.339\n331\n141\n140\n. The Partners expect an annual return of about [NOT PUBLIC\nHCTS DATA BEGINS . . . . . . NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA ENDS] on their\ninvestment in ALLETE.340\n332\n This return significantly exceeds the returns produced by\npublicly traded utilities. S&P Global, for example, reported that there were 55\nreturn-on-equity determinations by regulatory bodies for electric utilities in 2024, ranging\nfrom 9.20 %\npercent\n to 10.50 %\npercent\n, with an average of 9.74 %\npercent\n.341\n333\n More\ngenerally, the annual returns sought by the Partners also exceed credible cost of equity\nestimates for average-risk publicly traded companies. In most cases, the cost of equity\nfor publicly traded companies is less than 8 %\npercent\n.342\n334\n And the returns generated\nby publicly traded utilities specifically have totaled about 8.36 %\npercent\n during the past\ndecade.343\n335\n142\n141\n. The Partners say\ncontend\n they will earn the difference between a\nreasonable regulated return and their desired return in two ways. First, the Partners cite\nALLETE’s unregulated operations as a source of returns.

Private equity firms are investment managers that raise capital,\ntypically from institutional investors (i.e., sovereign wealth funds, pension funds,\ninsurance companies, endowments, and wealthy individuals), that then use that capital,\noften along with substantial amounts of debt, to acquire companies or other\nassets.366\n358\n154\n153\n. Successful private equity investing necessitates careful evaluation\nof investments, structuring of deals, financial engineering, and operational engineering,\nas well as achievement of substantial returns in a specified timeframe.367\n359\n155\n154\n. Because successful private equity investments hinge on the ability\nto make substantial returns in a specified timeframe, an inability to invest capital as\nplanned may drive the Partners to employ earlier-than-expected exit strategies or a\nreevaluation of the investment’s (i.e., ALLETE’s) viability.368\n360\n In other words, exit\nstrategies also constitute a key component of private equity investment, because\ninvestors must provide themselves a strategy to end involvement with their\ninvestments.369\n361\n156\n155\n. Here, the Partners have not committed to owning ALLETE for any\nperiod of time.

Such an early exit would likely be uneconomic and inefficient, and\nthe record demonstrates that such an exit by the Partners is highly plausible. These are\nmaterial risks that weigh against a finding of public interest.\nC. Risks to Minnesota Power’s Ratepayers\n1. Projected Rate Increases\n164\n163\n. In negotiating the merger agreement with the Partners, ALLETE\nrequired a substantial premium to its market value.382\n374\n ALLETE rejected the Partners’\ninitial offer of $62.50 per share and their second offer of $64 per share before accepting\na third offer of $67 per share.383\n375\n The last price reflects a 19 %\npercent\n to 22 %\npercent\npremium over the ALLETE common stock share price prior to news of the proposed\nacquisition influencing that price.384\n376\n The $67 per share price also reflects a premium\nof $1.5 billion over ALLETE’s book value.385\n377\n165\n164\n. Petitioners state “[t]he Acquisition is not expected to impact retail or\nmunicipal rates for utility customers nor materially affect other utility matters pending\nbefore the Commission.”386\n378\n Petitioners have specifically\n committed\nrepresented\n that\nthey will not seek recovery of several non-recurring costs related to the acquisition,\nincluding: (1) the acquisition premium paid to obtain ownership of ALLETE; (2)\ntransaction costs relating to the acquisition; and (3) transition costs.387\n379\n166\n165\n. However, the Partners’ targeted risk-adjusted return increases the\nrisk of unsustainable rate hikes in the future.388\n380\n GIP explains that the “scale of these\ninvestments and the speed at which they must be deployed make ALLETE an attractive\ninvestment opportunity and make GIP and CPP Investments the right partners for\nALLETE.”389\n381\n167\n166\n.

The Administrative\n Law\n Judge\n finds\n that\n the\nPartners’ private\nmemoranda, modeling, and communications with potential investors establish that the\nPartners are planning on significant rate increases that will likely exceed the long-run\nrate of inflation. These increases, if permitted by the Commission, would likely be\ndetrimental to the economic competitiveness of ALLETE’s largest mining and industrial\ncustomers, and would cause electricity costs to increase as a percentage of residential\ncustomer incomes.

The Partners have also made certain commitments to maintain the\npositions, compensation, and benefits of nonunion employees and to extend certain\nunion contracts in the near term.410\nIntervenors\n respond\n that\n these\n402\nThese\ncommitments are limited and allow for future corporate restructuring or downsizing,\nleaving a longer-term risk to ALLETE’s service quality.411\n403\n178\n177\n. The Partners plan to use “double leveraging” to increase the\namount of debt within ALLETE and Alloy Parent’s combined capital structure. This\nplanned use of double leveraging increases the risk that ALLETE will experience\nfinancial distress or be drawn into a parent bankruptcy.412\n404\n Even short of bankruptcy,\nfinancial pressure to service increased debt obligations could negatively impact service\nquality for Minnesota Power’s ratepayers.413\n405\n179\n178\n.

But the Partners’ capital-funding commitment has several\nshortcomings, discussed above, that limit its value in mitigating the risk that the\nPartners could underinvest in ALLETE.

The Administrative  Law  Judge  finds  that Intervenors have raised a\ncredible risk that the acquisition Acquisition  could harm service quality. This risk is\nrelevant to the public-interest inquiry, since any harm to service quality would be\ndetrimental to ratepayers and the broader economy of northern Minnesota. While the\nprobability of severe service-quality impairment appears remote, there is a material risk\nthat ALLETE’s current “near perfect”416408 reliability could be impaired as a\nresult because  of operational or financial changes made by the Partners.\n3. Experience of Other Utilities\n181180. Upper Peninsula Power Company ( “UPPCO ”) is a utility serving\naround 52,000 customers in Michigan’s upper peninsula.417409 UPPCO is a product of\nthe region’s “economy tied to its natural resources of forestry products, copper and iron\nore.”418410 Its initial generation “was constructed for the primary purpose of powering the\ncopper mining and forest products industry not to serve residential customers remote to\nthose industries.”419411 Thus, its history, relative size, and geographic remoteness make\nit similar to Minnesota Power in many respects that are not common to other\nutilities.420412\n182181. In 2014, the Michigan Public Service Commission (the “Michigan\nPSC”) approved the sale of UPPCO to Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners for about\n$298 million.421The413That acquisition was premised, in part, on the\nunderstanding belief  that the acquiring investor would “provide UPPCO with the capital\nnecessary to maintain and improve its existing delivery infrastructure.”422414 The sale\nwas at a “substantial price for UPPCO over its book value” with a “substantial amount of\ndebt,” leading to financial risk if revenues cannot cover debt at different levels of the\ncorporate structure.423415 As part of issuing its approval, the Michigan PSC found that\nthe acquisition would not result in subsidization of non-regulated activity through\nUPPCO customer rates.424416\n415407 Ex.

Seven years later, in 2021, the Michigan PSC approved a second\nsale of UPPCO to Axium Infrastructure, which promised not to raise rates until\n2023.430422 As part of issuing its approval, the Michigan PSC again found that the\nacquisition would not result in subsidization of non-regulated activity through UPPCO\ncustomer rates.431423 The Michigan PSC also found the acquisition would not have an\nadverse effect on customer or rates or the provision of safe, reliable, and adequate\nelectric service.432424\n185184. In 2023, UPPCO filed a rate case that resulted in a 10.1 %percent\nrate increase.433425 In 2024, UPPCO filed a second rate case requesting a 16 %percent\nrate increase and proposing to increase its profit margin on infrastructure investments\nfrom 9.9 %percent  to 10.7 %percent .434426 As of December 2024, UPPCO’s rates were\n9 cents per kilowatt-hour higher than the average rate at other investor-owned utilities in\nMichigan.435427\n186.

In 2015, UPPCO filed a rate case.425417 In that rate case, UPPCO:\n(i) requested a large increase to its authorized return on common equity, (ii) requested\nsubstantial increases in expenses to recover increases in pension costs not discussed\nas part of the acquisition proceeding; (iii) revealed it had reduced distribution-system\nmaintenance investment during the transfer of control, then proposed a large increase\nin maintenance costs for the future test year; and (iv) requested substantial costs to\nincrease staffing levels.426418 After the acquisition, UPPCO was also slow to terminate\nan above-market power purchase agreement with a previously affiliated entity and\nincurred high costs of debt.427419 In 2018, UPPCO filed another rate case, seeking to\nraise rates by nearly $10 million.428420 Collectively, these post-acquisition developments\nexacerbated an affordability problem for UPPCO customers.429421\n425417 Ex.

Given the similarities between ALLETE and UPPCO  and\nTXU/Energy  Future  Holdings , the Administrative Law Judge recommends  that  the\nCommission scrutinize the appropriateness of finds that  the private-equity model offered\nby the Partners in evaluating  whether  the proposed  acquisition is notin the public\ninterest.428\nD. Risks to Regulatory Compact\n1. Reduced Transparency\n188186. One of the primary differences between a utility that is part of a\npublicly traded company and one owned by private investors is transparency.438429 If the\nproposed transaction is approved, ALLETE will no longer file thequarterly, annual, or\nother SEC reports required of publicly traded companies.439430\n189187. SEC reports, such as Forms 10-Q (quarterly reports) and Forms\n10-K (annual reports), along with associated disclosures like earnings call transcripts\nand investor presentations, currently provide a comprehensive, public view of\nALLETE’s overall financial performance and strategic direction.440431 Such reports\ninclude consolidated financial statements, ALLETE management’s discussion and\nanalysis, risk factors, and forward-looking statements.441432 Publicly-traded companies\nmust also file current reports after certain specified events—usually within four business\ndays of the event.442433\n190188. The primary reason that companies file SEC reports is to protect\ninvestors.443434 Because SEC reports include both regulated and unregulated\nconsolidated financial statements for ALLETE and all subsidiaries, they also allow\n437 Ex. CURE-600 at 11-12 (Baker Direct).\n428 Another  cautionary  tale  is TXU/Energy  Future  Holdings.  TXU/Energy  Future\nHoldings,  a utility  with  1.7 million  customers,  was  acquired  by private  equity  owners  in\n2007,  and  then  went  bankrupt  after  its private  equity  owners  could  not cover  debt\npayments  with  cash  flow  from  rates.487 TXU/Energy  Future  Holdings  began  showing\nfinancial  distress  only  two years  after  acquisition,  and  by 2017,  just ten years  after\nacquisition, its regulated utility portion was sold in bankruptcy to Sempra Energy.487\n438429 Ex.

ALLETE’s SEC filings are also actively covered by several\ninvestment analysists, who analyze and produce regular reports on ALLETE’s filings\nand operations.445436 These analysts would likely cease providing regular analysis of\nALLETE if the proposed acquisition is approved.446437\n192190. Whether or not the proposed transaction is approved, ALLETE will\nremain subject to FERC reporting requirements.447438 FERC forms 1 and 3Q focus\nexclusively on the regulated utility’s operations (i.e., Minnesota Power and Wisconsin\nPower and Light).448439 These reports provide granular data specific to utility operations,\nincluding plant-in-service balances, construction work in progress, and operating costs,\nas governed by the Uniform System of Accounts.449440\n193191. Whether or not the proposed acquisition is approved, ALLETE will\nalso continue to make annual filings with the Commission, including, but not limited to,\nannual capital structure filings and Jurisdictional Annual Reports that explain the\nownership, control, and financing of the regulated utility and consolidated ALLETE\nentity.450441 ALLETE will also continue to provide such information in these filings as\nrequired by Commission order, including its current obligation to provide credit rating\nagency reports.451442\n194. The Petition  states  that192. Petitioners  claim  ALLETE will continue\nto publish its Corporate Sustainability Report, which contains information related to\nenvironmental, social, and governance issues, including ALLETE’s efforts to encourage\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.452443 The Petitioners have also committed to take\ncertain actions designed to address concerns about transparency. For example, the\nPetitioners state they will provide compliance filings on equity infusions from and\ndividends to Alloy Parent just as ALLETE currently provides compliance filings in its\ncapital structure docket.453444 The Petitioners state they will file the audited ALLETE\nconsolidated financial statements with supplemental schedules as part of the annual\ncapital structure petition.454445 The Petitioners state they will provide the Commission\nwith audited financial statements and supplemental schedules of ALLETE and with\n444435 Ex.

If the acquisition is approved, ALLETE would be under no\nobligation to provide detailed financial information about GIP or CPP.457448 The Partners\nhave made no voluntary commitment to provide financial information about GIP or\nCPP.458449 Nothing in Minnesota law otherwise requires a regulated utility to file public\nfinancial statements.459450\n196194. FERC forms 1 and 3Q do not provide broader insights into\nALLETE’s financial health and strategy comparable to what is provided in SEC\nreports.460451 Likewise, an annual report filed with the Commission requires much less\nfrequent reporting on ALLETE’s financial health and accounting than SEC regulations\nrequire of publicly traded companies.461452\n197195. Privatization of ALLETE and the discontinuation of ALLETE’s SEC\nreporting obligations would significantly reduce information about ALLETE that is\navailable to the Commission and Minnesota ratepayers.462453\n2. Less Cooperation\n198196. Petitioners argue that approving the proposed acquisition would not\nalter the Commission’s oversight of ALLETE.463454 Intervenors, on the other hand,\nassert that effective regulation depends to a large degree on the cooperation of the\nutility.464455 And they contend that ALLETE would be less cooperative and transparent\nwith its regulators if it were owned by the Partners.465456\n455446 Ex.

ALLETE controls much of the information that the Commission\nreviews in making regulatory decisions.466\n457\n For example, if ALLETE presents the\nCommission with an investment plan that is biased toward capital investments, the\nCommission can try to mitigate this bias by modifying the plan, but it cannot create a\nnew plan without the utility’s cooperation.467\n458\n Similarly, while other parties can review\nand comment on ALLETE’s plan, the utility will always have the most technical\nknowledge and information, a phenomenon known as “information asymmetry.”468\n459\n200\n198\n. Owning ALLETE would put the Partners in a position to shape\nMinnesota Power’s regulatory advocacy. As ALLETE’s owners, the Partners would\nhave control of ALLETE’s board, which guides ALLETE and Minnesota Power’s\nday-to-day operations and approves their budgets and strategic plans.469\n460\n Partners\nalso have consent rights over ALLETE or Minnesota Power [NOT PUBLIC HCTS\nDATA BEGINS . . . \n70\n461\n . . . NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA ENDS].\n201\n199\n. While the proposed acquisition would not change the\nCommission’s authority over ALLETE, new ownership could increase the difficulty of\nregulating the utility if the utility becomes less cooperative or transparent. Throughout\nthis proceeding, the Partners have objected to many information requests, provided\nnonresponsive answers, provided heavily redacted responses, and employed tiered\ntrade-secret designations that hampered intervenor review.471\n462\n In one example, the\nPartners designated several documents highly confidential trade secret (“HCTS”) in\ntheir entirety but still redacted relevant, nonprivileged information in versions provided\nto intervenor representatives who had signed a nondisclosure agreement entitling them\nto review HCTS data.472\n463\n Removal of the inappropriate redactions required a motion to\ncompel and an order by the Administrative Law Judge.473\n464\n202\n200\n.

Intervenors contend that the Partners\nwill ensure that ALLETE is actively managed by controlling: (1) the makeup and\nappointment of the Board of Directors; and (2) the types of decisions the Board\napproves and how they are approved.475\n466\n1.

Board Appointment and Composition\n209\n207\n. The Partners intend to drive and guide governance decisions, as\nshown by their plans to appoint the new ALLETE board of directors.483\n474\n210\n208\n. GIP explained that “[t]he ALLETE board will be comprised of 13\ndirectors, one of whom will be the chief executive officer ( “\nCEO ”\n) of ALLETE and two of\nwhom will be additional independent directors—one from Minnesota and one from\nWisconsin—who are not employed by the Partners or ALLETE. . . . The other ten\nmembers of the board will be appointed by the Partners, with the right to appoint a\ndirector for every 10 %\npercent\n of ownership of ALLETE (with CPP Investments\nappointing 4\nfour\n members, GIP Fund V appointing 4\nfour\n members, and Tower Bridge\nappointing 2\ntwo\n members).”484\n475\n211\n209\n. Such a structure will grant the Partners authority to designate all\nboard members, subject only to the requirement that two members need to be from\nMinnesota and Wisconsin.485\n476\n212\n210\n. Because the ALLETE board will have 6 GIP directors and 4 CPPIB\ndirectors on a 13-person board,486\nIntervenors\n contend\n477\nthe Partners (constituting\nroughly 77 %\npercent\n of the voting authority) will likely have complete control over the\nboard’s decisions. Given both Partners are private equity investors with similar profit\nmotives, they will have little incentive not to vote as a bloc, effectively nullifying input of\n481\n472\n Ex. LPI-1003, Ex.

And the Partners\nhave not committed to not “influencing ALLETE Board decisions regarding who should\nbe on Minnesota Power’s management team.”488\n479\n3. Consent Rights\n213\n211\n. Not only will the Partners control the makeup and appointment of\nALLETE’s board, but they will also be able to override the board’s decisions on\nimportant issues. Confidential term sheets addressing key governance provisions\ndemonstrate GIP and CPPIB’s intent to exercise consent rights over nearly all\nmeaningful decision-making.\n214\n212\n. The Partners will retain consent rights over any decisions that could\nimpact the value of their investment. CPPIB explained the types of decisions over which\nthe Partners would maintain consent rights include “budgets, acquisitions or\ndispositions exceeding certain material dollar thresholds, issuance of additional equity\ninterests, assumption of additional debt, fundamental changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, and dissolution or bankruptcy.”489\n480\n215\n213\n. Similarly, GIP stated that “The ALLETE board itself will have the\nauthority to make decisions and govern the business, though . . . the Partners as the\nshareholders of ALLETE will retain consent rights over certain material actions of the\nCompany.”490\n481\n The terms over which the Partners maintain control (i.e., ALLETE\nactions requiring Partner approval), include, but are not limited to, the following:\n[NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . .\n487\nSee \nEx.

Without an adequate governance structure, ALLETE and its\nratepayers could be harmed by conflicts of interest arising from business relationships\nbetween the utility and Partners’ affiliates or appointed directors, or an unchecked\nability for the Partners to engage in risky financial, operational, and governance\nengineering as they make final budgeting and debt issuance decisions.496\n487\n218\n216\n. The governance plan, as envisioned by the Partners, does not\ntrack other recent take-private transactions and inadequately balances investor,\nratepayer, and community interests.497\n488\n Further, the promised governance changes\nwill facilitate ALLETE’s loss of control over operations.\n219\n217\n.

Intervenors object to Petitioners’ proposed approach. Intervenors\nnote that the Partners will hold more than a 5 %percent  interest in ALLETE and will beALLETE’s business plans and operating and capital budgets will shift away from local\noversight to the Partners, who have an incentive to drive an increase in ALLETE’s\nnear-term returns without regard for the utility’s long-term health. At the same time,\nALLETE’s senior management does not appear to understand the significant impact of\nthe changes to the Board of Director’s makeup or processes. In sum, the proposed\ngovernance structures fail to adequately balance the needs of owners, ratepayers, and\nthe community, and pose the risk of outsized influence by the Partners on the\ndecision-making authority of company management.\nF. Affiliated-Interest Statute Compliance\n1. Plain Language of Minn. Stat. § 216B.48  (2024)\n220218. Minnesota’s affiliated interest statute is generally intended to\nprevent conflicts of interest and cross subsidies between public utilities and their\naffiliates. Put differently, absent market competition the statute ensures, in the absence\nof arm’s-length transactions, that ratepayers are protected if the utility enters into\n“sweetheart deals” with its affiliates.498489\n221219. The statute provides that any person or corporation directly or\nindirectly holding at least 5 %percent  of the voting securities of a public utility is an\naffiliated interest. If that person or corporation also holds at least 5 %percent  of the\nvoting securities of another corporation, then an affiliated interest exists between that\ncorporation and the public utility too.499490 When an affiliated interest exists, no contract\nor arrangement involving more than $50,000 is valid or effective until the contract or\narrangement has received written Commission approval.500491\n222220. To comply with the statute, Petitioners propose requiring all of\nALLETE’s suppliers and any industrial customers with contracted rates to identify\nannually whether they are more than 5 %percent  owned by CPPIB, GIP, or BlackRock,\nand then report those entities on its annual affiliated interest report. ALLETE also would\nidentify all contracts over $1 million with any of those suppliers or customers and notify\nthe Commission within 30 days of execution, attesting that the contract was negotiated\nat arm’s length.501492 Petitioners assert that their proposed approach is consistent with\npast Commission practice not to review transactions between regulated utility and the\nsubsidiaries or affiliates of institutional investors.502493\n498489In re Minn.

Intervenors also argue that even if Petitioners ’\n approach complied\nwith the statute, it would be inadequate to prevent probable conflicts of interest and\ncross subsidies. For example, Intervenors point to CPPIB’s plan [NOT PUBLIC HCTS\nDATA BEGINS . . . \n497\n507\n498\n. . .\nNOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA ENDS]. They\n also\n assert\n that\nSimilarly,\n Petitioners’\napproach is out of step with other recent take-private transactions. In the El Paso\nElectric proceeding, for example, J.P. Morgan made firm commitments to comply with\naffiliated interest statutes, rules, and regulations.508\n499\n2. Public and Private Equity Ownership\n225\n223\n. Intervenors also disagree with Petitioners’ characterization of past\nCommission practice. Currently, no single public investor has a controlling interest in\nALLETE. BlackRock holds a 13 %\npercent\n interest, Vanguard has an 11.4 %\npercent\ninterest, State Street has a 4.2 %\npercent\n interest, and no other investor has more than\na 2%\npercent\n interest.509\n500\n ALLETE’s public investors have a mix of long and\nshort-term investment timelines.510\n501\n Given the diffuse and transient nature of\nALLETE’s current investors, none of them are able to exert decision-making authority\nover ALLETE. The same is true for Minnesota’s other investor-owned utilities.511\n502\n226\n224\n. Post-transaction, ALLETE would be the only utility in the state that\nwill\n be\nowned by only two entities – 60 %\npercent\n by one and 40 %\npercent\n by\nanother.512\n503\n And the Partners’ directors will govern ALLETE after the deal closes.

NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA ENDS] .513\n504\n Given these\nfacts, Intervenors assert that \nthe Partners will have the means to steer contracts to their\nfavored counterparties\ncounterparts\n unlike ALLETE’s current institutional investors.514\n505\n227\n225\n. As a result, Intervenors\n assert\nthe risks of self-dealing and\ncross-subsidies would be unique to ALLETE. Given these factors, intervenors\n assert\nthat\nif ALLETE does not track its affiliates and submit its affiliated transactions as\nrequired, the work of the Commission to ensure that ratepayers are being protected\nfrom self-dealing will become extremely difficult, if not impossible.515\n506\n228\n226\n. The Administrative Law Judge concurs with Intervenors about the\nplain language of section 216B.48. The statute requires utilities to seek Commission\napproval for contracts or arrangements worth more than $50,000. Even if compliance\nmay be burdensome, that does not render Intervenors’ interpretation unreasonable or\nabsurd. In fact, the Partners’ extensive holdings underscore the statute’s purpose:\nidentifying above-market contracts that might not be readily apparent. Here, the\nPartners’ expansive interests coupled with their control over ALLETE heightens the very \nrisks that the statute is intended to curb. The Administrative\n Law\n Judge\n recommends\nthat the \nCommission should \nrequire full compliance with the statute.\nG. Labor Risks\n229\n227\n. Private equity buyouts of publicly traded companies often result in\njob losses. A 2019 study by researchers at the University of Chicago and Harvard\nBusiness School found that employment shrinks 13 %\npercent\n over two years after\ntake-private buyouts of publicly listed firms compared with control firms.516\n507\n The\nbankruptcy risk for these firms, which would impact workers as well as other\nstakeholders, is ten times that of firms that were not taken private.517\n508\n230\n228\n. GIP’s recent experience with the SunPower bankruptcy illustrates\nthe impact of its ownership on that company’s workers. After the company filed for\nbankruptcy protection, it laid off about 1,000 employees to better achieve financial\nviability.518\n509\n231.\nCPPIB’s\n229.\nCPP’s\n recent experience with Fortrex Solutions similarly\nillustrates additional labor-related issues have occurred during periods of private equity\nownership without sufficient controls. In 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor found that\nFortrex (then operating under a different name) employed at least 102 children in\ndangerous meat processing facilities in eight states including Minnesota.519\n510\n Fortrex\n513\n504\n Ex.

Given  this history 230. While  ALLETE  has committed  to a new  labor\nagreement  with  IBEW  Local  31 through  April  30, 2028,  what  will happen  after  the\nexpiration  of the agreement  is uncertain.  Given  the cited  examples  of the Partners’\nlabor  practices  in other  investments , the Administrative Law Judge recommends that\nthe Commission scrutinize the labor practices of the Partners in evaluating the strength\nand length of the voluntary labor commitments offered by Petitioners.\nIV.

Based on the foregoing these  Findings of Fact  and  the record  in this\nproceeding , the Administrative Law Judge makes the following:\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nAI.Commission Jurisdiction COMMISSION JURISDICTION\n1. The Commission and the Administrative Law Judge have jurisdiction over\nthe subject matter of the proceeding under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50  (2024) , Minn. R.\n7825.1700– .1800 (2023), and Minn.

The Commission has jurisdiction over public utilities.522513 A public utility is\na person, corporation, or other legal entity furnishing retail electric or gas service or\nproducing electricity or gas for retail sale.523514\n3. The Commission’s rules distinguish between a utility service provider and\nits “controlling corporation.”524515 Courts also distinguish between a corporation’s\nregulated utility operations and its unregulated operations that are generally beyond the\nCommission’s control.525516 Alloy Parent and the Partners mayare not bepublic utilities\nbecause they will not directly furnish retail electric service in Minnesota.\n4. The Commission cannot accept jurisdiction over entities or matters where\nthe legislature has not granted it express authority.526517 The Commission may only\ncompel compliance with its orders when the underlying order is within its authority.527518\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA. Carbon Free Standard\n5. Because  Petitioners  assert  that  the Acquisition  is necessary  to finance\nMinnesota  Power’s  compliance  with  Minnesota’s  Carbon  Free  Standard  (Minn.  Stat.  §\n216B.1691),  the Standard’s  requirements  are relevant  in determining  whether  the\nproposed acquisition is consistent with the public interest.519\n522513 Minn.

Minn.  Stat.  § 216B.1691,  subd.  2g, requires  electric  utilities  to generate  or\nprocure  100  percent  of the utility’s  total  retail  electric  sales  to retail  customers  in\nMinnesota from carbon-free energy technologies by 2040.\n7. However,  Minn.  Stat.  § 216B.1691  contains  certain  exceptions  that allow\nthe Commission  to modify  the legislation’s  requirements  if needed  to protect  reliability\nor affordability.520\n8. The Carbon  Free  Standard  also  includes  an affirmative  requirement  for\nthe Commission  to “maximize  net benefits”  to Minnesotans  when  implementing  it,\nstating  “[t]he  commission  shall  take  all reasonable  actions  within  the commission’s\nstatutory authority to ensure this section [§ 216B.1691] is implemented in a manner that \nmaximizes net benefits to all Minnesota citizens.”521\nB. Public Interest Standard\n59. The proposed sale of ALLETE is governed by Minn. Stat. § 216B.50,\nsubdivision subd.  1. The subdivision provides:\nNo public utility shall sell, acquire, lease, or rent any plant as an operating\nunit or system in this state . . . without first being authorized so to do by\nthe commission. . . . If the commission finds that the proposed action is\nconsistent with the public interest, it shall give its consent and approval by\norder in writing. In reaching its determination, the commission shall take\ninto consideration the reasonable value of the property, plant, or securities\nto be acquired or disposed of, or merged and consolidated.\n10. Section  216B.50  requires  the Commission,  when  considering  approval  of\nthe acquisition,  merger,  or consolidation  of a public  utility,  to find that  “the  proposed\naction is consistent with the public interest” before giving “its consent and approval.”522\n611.

To determine whether a transaction is consistent with the public interest,\nthe Commission  weighs  the perceived detriments are weighed against perceived\nbenefits to the public.530The525In applying  this balancing  test,  the Commission also\nconsiders whether it is reasonably likely that a transaction will either benefit or harm\nratepayers.531526\n13. The Commission  approves  transactions  when  the “benefits  are sufficient\nto justify  the proposal.”527The Commission  likewise  rejects  transactions  where  the\n“potential costs to ratepayers are too high, and the potential benefits too uncertain.”528\n814. The public interest includes compliance with the Carbon  Free\nStandard Minn.  Stat.  § 216B.1691 . The Commission must “take all reasonable actions\nwithin the commission’s statutory authority” to ensure that the Carbon Free Standard “is\nimplemented in a manner that maximizes net benefits to all Minnesota citizens.”532529\n915.Parties The parties  have argued that the public interest standard requires\nthe Commission find that the deal either produces net benefits or, alternatively, avoids\nnet harm. The proposed deal is inconsistent with the public interest under either\nstandard because it results in net harm to the public interest.533530\n1016. The Petitioners have not established it is more likely than not that the\ndeal’s possible benefits will be realized or that they equal or outweigh the risks of harm.\nIn terms of benefits, it is unclear  whether  the deal Petitioners  have  not shown  that the\nAcquisition  will improve ALLETE’s access to capital or even whether ALLETE needs\nimproved access. The other putative benefit identified by proponents of the deal is\naccess to the Partners’ expertise. This benefit appears to have limited value given the\nPartners’ assurances that they intend to maintain ALLETE’s existing management,\nstaff, and business plan. Weighing against these possible benefits, there are\nforeseeable risks of harm to the energy transition, ALLETE’s long-term financial health,\nand ratepayers. On balance, the risks of the deal, as proposed, outweigh the possible\nbenefits.\n11. Nor do the17. The proposed commitments offered by Petitioners do\nnotrebalance the transaction to avoid net harm.

Some of the proposed\nconditions may be unenforceable. And others offer little benefit to ratepayers or the\nregulatory compact. It also appears that many of the Petitioners’ proposed\ncommitments are out of step with other recent take-private transactions involving\nutilities.\nC. Affiliated-Interest Statute Requirements\n12. If the transaction  is approved,  Petitioners  will have  to comply  with\nMinnesota’s  affiliated-interest  interest  statute.534The law provides  that  any person  or\ncorporation  directly  or indirectly  holding  at least  5% of the voting  securities  of a public\nutility  is an affiliated  interest.  If that person  or corporation  also  holds  at least  5% of the\nvoting  securities  of another  corporation,  then  an affiliated-interest  relationship  exists\nbetween that corporation and the public utility too.535\n13. When  an affiliated  interest  exists,  no contract  or arrangement  involving\nmore  than  $50,000  is valid  or effective  until  the contract  or arrangement  has received\nwritten Commission approval.536\n14. The Partners  will hold  more  than  a 5% interest  in ALLETE  and  will be\nALLETE’s  affiliates  under  the statute.537Any other  entities  in which  the Partners  have  at\nleast  5% interest  also  will be ALLETE’s  affiliates.538Any contracts  or arrangements\nbetween  ALLETE  and  these  entities  exceeding  $50,000  require  Commission\napproval.539\n1518.

E -015/PA -24-198 \n  \nDear Mr. Moratzka:  \n \nOn July 14, 2025, the Large Power Intervenors served the Department of Commerce with \ndiscovery requests 500 through 504 in connection with the above -referenced matter . These \nrequests, however, are untimely. The deadline for serving discovery was March 26, 2025. (First \nPrehearing Order ¶ 12.) Moreover, the Minnesota chapter 1400 rules that would otherwise permit \nLPI to engage in timely discovery are no longer applicable given that jurisdiction over the matter \nhas returned to the Public Utilities Commission. See Minn. R. 1400.8300 ; Minn. Admin. Proc. § \n7.4.1 (3rd ed.). Finally, even if LPI’s  discovery was timely and permitted by the applicable rules , \nseveral questions attempt to obtain privileged work -product or otherwise inadmissible settlement \ncommunications . \n \nAlthough the Department will not be responding to LPI’s untimely discovery, the \nDepartment appreciates that there is great interest in the stipulation and questions about how the \nSettling Parties intend for various provisions to be construed. LPI, for example, asked the \nDepartment which stipulation provisions are new,  and which were previously proposed by \nPetitioners. That information can be found in footnote three of the stipulation . In another instance, \nLPI asked the Department about the composition of the post -Acquisition board. To clarify, the  \nboard will have fourteen  directors. The Partners will select ten directors based on their respective \nownership  interests . The Partners will select three directors by agreement . The final director will \nbe ALLETE’s CEO. Of the thirteen non -CEO directors, six of them will meet the NYSE’s \ndefinition of independence and the Partners will appoint the remaining seven directors to represent \ntheir respective interests  consistent with their fiduciary obligations to ALLETE under Minnesota \nlaw.  \n \nIf LPI has  other questions about the meaning of stipulation provisions, please contact me \nby telephone  or e-mail. While discovery is not permissible  at this point in the contested -case \nAndrew P. Moratzka  \nJuly 1 8, 2025  \nPage 2 \n \n proceeding, the Department is available to help other interested parties understand the provisions \nof the stipulation.  \n \nThank you for your attention to this matter.   \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n/s/ Richard Dornfeld  \nRICHARD DORNFELD  \nAssistant Attorney General  \n \n(651) 757 -1327  (Voice)  \n(651) 297 -1235 (Fax)  \nrichard.dornfeld @ag.state.mn.us  \n \nAttorney  for Minnesota Department of Commerce  \nEnclosures"

I do not believe this is the interest ofany of the residents in the service area and it will cause undue financial burden on an alreadyeconomically weak area. In addition to this, Minnesota Power has made strides to move towardsrenewable energy resources and I have no faith that the potential new owners would continue theseefforts. Selling our utility company to this corporation would be devastating to everyone in theregion."

No public utilities should\nEVER be placed in private hands. This will cause services to decline and rates to increase, it ALWAYS does. The\nfact that this is even being consider is criminal. If anything Minnesota Power should be sold to the State of\nMinnesota and run by a publicly elected and accountable board. That should be the case with ALL utilities, and\nphone/internet services ARE utilities too. No way should these sorts of things be left in the hands of greedy\nprivate companies who use them to enrich themselves while exploiting citizens. You should find it shameful you\nneed to be told this, but that's where we are as a society I guess, you have to tell the government it's wrong for\nthem to let companies fuck them over. Who do you work for 'we the people', or the American oligarchs?"

We would effectively lose control of any bargaining or control of our power comes in our\narea.\nI’ve watched a documentary on what this organization has done to the Yellowstone Valley in Montana, it has\ndevalued properties and created an environmental travesty.\nThis is not in the best interest of Minnesotans, especially Minnesota’s that are already being squeezed in nearly\nevery department by the billionaire oligarch class that runs out country.\nPlease do not let this happen!
