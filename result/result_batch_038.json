R. 1400.6200, Minn. R. 7829.0800, and other applicable provisions of \nthe Minnesota Rules, Sierra Club respectfully submits its Petition to Intervene as a party in the \nabove- referenced docket.  \n A.  Identity of Petitioner  \n Sierra Club is a national nonprofit environmental organization working to promote safe and healthy communities, protect and improve air and water quality in the United States, limit \nthe adverse effects of climate change, and promote the transition to clean  energy. Sierra Club’s \ncampaigns advance the development of energy conservation  and renewable energy  policies \nwhich eliminate or reduce carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollution emissions, reduce or \nplace downward pressure on utility rates, improve public health, and create jobs. Sierra Club’s \nBeyond Coal Campaign advocates for a nationwide transition from coal to clean energy in the \nelectric sector, and has a strong interest in advancing just and equitable climate solutions.  \n To promote affordable and clean energy, Sierra Club frequently advocates before state \npublic utility commission s in numerous states and before federal agencies on issues related to  \nutility resource planning, ratemaking, market design, and fair participation. Sierra Club regularly \nparticipates in utility resource planning  matters before the Minnesota Public Utilitie s \nCommission, in order to advance resource and investment decisions that minimize or reduce \npollutant emissions, advance renewable energy, and focus on equitable outcomes. Sierra Club has also intervened in utility acquisition dockets in other states. \n 2  Sierra Club has over 14,000 members in Minnesota, many of whom are Minnesota Power \ncustomers. Sierra Club has consistently advocated for Minnesota Power to transition away from \nfossil -fueled electricity generation and invest in affordable, renewable energy sources.  \n  B.  Intervention Standard \n The Oct ober 28, 2024 Prehearing Order in this docket requires that petitions to intervene \nbe filed by November 15, 2024, and that they comply with Minn. R. 1400.6200, which provides \nthe standard for intervention as a party in a contested case: \n \nThe petition shall show how the petitioner's legal rights, duties, or privileges may be \ndetermined or affected by the contested case; shall show how the petitioner may be \ndirectly affected by the outcome or that petitioner's par ticipation is authorized by statute, \nrule, or court decision; shall set forth the grounds and purposes for which intervention is \nsought; and shall indicate petitioner's statutory right to intervene if one should exist.  \n \nMinn. R. 1400.6200, subp. 1. Sierra Club satisfies this intervention standard, for the reasons set forth below. Sierra Club also satisfies the general standard for intervention in Commission \nproceedings set forth in Minn. R. 7829.0800, subp. 2, which provides in relevant part: \n \nThe petition must allege the grounds for intervention and must be granted upon a \nshowing that . . . the outcome of the proceeding will bind or affect the person with respect to an interest peculiar to that person, as distinguished from an interest common to the public or other ratepayers in general, or the person's interests are not adequately represented by one or more other parties participating in the case.  \n \nSierra Club ’s petition satisfies the intervention standards under both Minn. R. 1400.6200, subp. 1 \nand Minn. R. 7829.0800, subp. 2, for the reasons explained below.  \n C. Sierra Club  Has Direct and Substantial  Interest s in this Proceeding . \n This proceeding raises issues which are important to the environmental, public health, and affordability interests that Sierra Club seeks to advance.  As noted above, Sierra Club has \nover 14,000 members in Minnesota, many of whom are re sidential customers of Minnesota \nPower. Sierra Club and its Minnesota members have an interest in maximizing the share of their \nelectricity usage that comes from renewable, affordable, environmentally responsible energy \nsources.  Sierra Club has an interest in ensuring that Minnesota Power transition s away from \nfossil fuels , including the coal-fired Boswell Energy Center, and accelerate s invest ments in \n 3 renewable generation, storage, and energy efficiency measures. Sierra Club also seeks to ensure \nthat Minnesota Power complies with the state’s Carbon Free Standard, and that the resources \nused to satisfy the standard are in fact carbon -free. Final ly, Sierra Club has advocated to ensure \nrigorous environmental review of Minnesota Power’s proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center.  The outcome of this case will directly and substantially  affect Sierra Club’s interests, and \nmay impact Sierra Club’s legal ri ghts, duties, or privileges. The Commission’s decision to \napprove or deny the proposed acquisition may impact Sierra Club’s members who are Minnesota \nPower customers . The proposed acquisition may impact Minnesota Power’s future investment \ndecisions regarding both fossil- fueled generating resources and renewable resources , which is of \ninterest to Sierra Club . The acquisition may ultimately impact the electricity bills paid by Sierra \nClub members who are Minnesota Power customers, and the amount of those members’ electricity consumption that is supplied from renewable sources. Moreover, the October 7, 2024 \nOrder for Hearing  specifies that this proceeding will address the proposed acquisition’s potential \nimpacts on Minnesota Power’s compliance with the Carbon Free Standard and on the proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center, both matters in which Sierra Club has a  substantial int erest.  \n The proposed acquisition in this docket would also interact with other related transactions in which Sierra Club has an interest. The October 7, 2024 Order for Hearing asks P arties to \naddress the relevance of related dockets before the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission \n(FERC) and other bodies. Sierra Club  filed a protest a t FERC on May 20, 2024 regarding \nBlackRock,  Inc.’s proposal to acquire interests in Global Infrastructure Management, LLC . The \ncombined effect of that transaction and the acquis ition at issue in this docket is that BlackRock \nwill own a stake in Minnesota Power. Sierra Club’s protest asserted that BlackRock’s indirect \nacquisition of a stake in Minnesota Power raises vertical market competitiveness concerns that \ncould adversely impact Minnesota ratepayers. This proceeding directly impact s the same \ninterests in ensuring a fair and competitive marketplace that Sierra Club has sought to protect via its engagement in the FERC proceeding. \n Sierra Club intends to participate fully in the development of a factual and legal record  in \nthis case, including through submission of expert testimony, cross-examination of witnesses, and filing of briefs. Sierra Club intends to provide relevant material evidence regarding the questions \nposed in the October 7, 2024 Order for Hearing, including the potential benefits, costs, and risks, \nassociated with the proposed acquisition, the proposal’s impact on ratepayers and on the public \n 4 interest, the relevance of related dockets before FERC, the Public Service Commission of \nWisconsin, and other bodies, and the proposal’s potential impacts on Minnesota Power’s \ncompliance with the Carbon Free Standard and on the proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center. \n \n D. No Other Party Adequately Represents Sierra Club’s Unique Interests.  \n Sierra Club’s unique interests are not adequately represented by any other part y to this \nproceeding.  While other intervenors may also represent ratepayer interests and/or environmental \ninterests, no other intervenor represents the specific inte rest of Sierra Club’s more than 14,000 \nindividual members in Minnesota, and no other party will analyze the specific set of issues that \nSierra Club intends to address on behalf of those members. \n No other intervenor will adequately represent Sierra Club’s particular interests in \nMinnesota Power’s transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy and in the utility’s \ninvestments in generating facilities including Boswell Energy Center and the proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center, or in compliance with the Carbon Free Standard. Moreover, no other \nintervenor represents Sierra Club’s specific interests regarding market competitiveness concerns , \nincluding the interests  that Sierra Club acted to protect in the FERC proceeding noted above. \n Sierra Club has subs tantial expertise and experience related to utility investments in \nrenewable and conventional energy, energy market design, and utility acquisitions generally. Sierra Club intends to file testimony addressing issues related to Sierra Club’s expertise . To t he \nextent that other environmental organizations have intervened or plan to intervene in this proceeding, Sierra Club anticipates that those groups will offer different views and expertise, and \nthey cannot represent Sierra Club’s Minnesota members or Sierr a Club’s positions. Sierra Club \nwill avoid any duplicative testimony. Sierra Club’s involvement will serve the public interest by providing meaningful and substantial information to the Commission and the public on issues \nrelated to the proposed acquisition. \n \n E. Conclusion \n Sierra Club satisfies the standard for intervention in this docket for the reasons set forth \nabove. This petition is timely filed before the November 15 deadline set in the October 28, 2024 \nPrehearing Order . Moreover, Sierra Club’s part icipation will not prejudice any other party to this  \ncase, will not unduly broaden the issues beyond those identified in the Order for Hearing, and \n 5 will not result in any delay . Sierra Club will comply with all deadlines in the existing procedural \nschedule set in the October 28, 2024 Prehearing Order.  Sierra Club understands the rights and \nresponsibilities of parties under Minn. R. 1400.7100 and will meet those requirements.  \n In order to protect its unique interests in this proceeding, Sierra Club respectfully requests \nthat its Petition to Intervene be granted and that it be accorded full party status. \n \n \nDated: November 15, 2024          Respectfully submitted,         \n___/s/ Patrick Woolsey _________________ \n \nKristin Henry  (Pro hac vice app. to be filed)  \nPatrick Woolsey (Pro hac vice app. to be filed)  \nSierra Club Environmental Law Program 2101 Webster Street Suite 1300 Oakland, CA  94612 (415) 977-5757 kristin.henry@sierraclub.org patrick.woolsey@sierraclub.org  Attorneys fo r Sierra Club \n  \nEvan Mulholland Minnesota Bar No. 0399072 Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy 1919 University Ave. W #515 St. Paul, MN 55104 (651) 223-5969 emulholland@mncenter.org  Local Counsel for Sierra Club \n          \n \n 6 Certificate of Service  \nI, Joaquin Garcia, certify that, on November 15, 2024, I submitted, by electronic filing, \nSierra Club’s Petition to Intervene in the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for the \nAcquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure \nPartners, PUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198/ OAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339, and electronically served it on all parties included in the official service list for this docket. \n \n/s/ Joaquin Garcia _ \nJoaquin Garcia \nSierra Club Environmental Law Prog ram \n2101 Webster Street Suite 1300 Oakland, CA  94612 (415) 977-5629 joaquin.garcia @sierraclub.org  \n \n \nKatherine Arnold\nOffice of the Attorney General-DOC\n445 Minnesota Street\nSuite 1400\nSt. Paul MN 55101Nancy Campbell\nDepartment of Commerce\n121 Seventh Place EastSuite 200\nSt. Paul MN 55101-2145Sharon Ferguson\nDepartment of Commerce\n85 7th Place E Ste 280\nSaint Paul MN 55101-2198\nJorge Alonso\nPublic Utilities Commission\n121 7th Place East\nSuite 350\nSt. Paul MN 55101Justin Andringa\nPublic Utilities Commission\n121 7th Place East, Suite 350\nSt Paul MN 55101Jason Bonnett\nPublic Utilities Commission\n121 East 7th Place suite 350\nSt. Paul MN 55101\nRobert Manning\nPublic Utilities Commission\n121 7th Place East\nSuite 350\nSaint Paul MN 55101Craig McDonnell\nMN Pollution Control Agency\n520 Lafayette Road\nSt. Paul MN 55101Will Seuffert TS\nPublic Utilities Commission\n121 7th Pl E Ste 350\nSaint Paul MN 55101\nKevin Adams\nCommunity Action Partnership of Ramse    \n450 Syndicate St N Ste 35\nSaint Paul MN 55104Craig Addonizio\nDepartment of Commerce\n85 7th Place, Suite 280\nSt Paul MN 55101Lori Andresen\nSave Our Sky Blue Waters\nP.O.
