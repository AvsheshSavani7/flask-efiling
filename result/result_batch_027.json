On p. 18, Witness Bulkley states, “As I discussed in Minnesota Power’s last rate \nproceeding, there are several reasons why market -to-book ratios exceed 1.0, for \nexample: 1) the operations are not 100 percent regulated, 2) the regulatory system includes lag  in the adjustment of the allowed ROE to the market COE, and 3) the \nutility’s rate base may not be identical to its GAAP book value.”  \n \na. Please provide any and all  research and analysis, third -party or internal, \ndemonstrating that these three factors -- unregulated operations, regulatory \nlag, differences between rate base and GAAP book value –  can account for \nall of the difference between market and book value, to the exclusion of \nROE in excess of COE, both in general and specifically for Minnesota \nPower. For internal research, please provide all analyses in functional Excel spreadsheets and all documentation of all assumptions  \n \nb. Please provide all relevant investment presentations and models, in functional Excel spreadsheets, where these three or any other factors are discussed or considered in the Partners’ valuation of Minnesota Power \nspecifically (not ALLETE).

Provide all analyses in functional Excel spreadsheets and  complete documentation of all \nsupporting assumptions.  \n \n \nResponse:  \n \nMinnesota Power and the Partners object to this request on the grounds that the information \nsought is irrelevant and/or not proportional to the needs of the case.    \nSubject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, witness Bulkley responds as follows:   \na.

Market -to-book ratios are of limited \nuse in investor equity valuations as well as cost of equity estimation for regulatory \npurposes.  Please refer to page 18, lines 8 -15, of the rebuttal testimony of Witness Ann Bulkley \nfor reasons why regulators find the use of market -to-book ratios inappropriate.

Further, the cited \nmaterials speak for themselves.   \n \nSubject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, witness Quackenbush responds as \nfollows:  \n \nNo, investment firms generally do not publish “cost of equity” estimates for the market as a \nwhole.  The data that Mr. Ellis cites appears to merely be projections by financial firms of stock market index price changes, which do not resemble rigorous cost of equity estimates and \nrepresent an inadequate shortcut to reach conclusions about the market  cost of equity.  As \nsuch, such data provides no useful information about the cost of equity.    \n A more credible way to estimate the cost of equity for a market index is to do a bottom -up \ncompany -by-company cost of equity analysis that is then aggregated for the index, an approach \ntaken in the paper entitled “Forward- Looking Market Risk Premiums (1992 -2020) and \nMacroeconomic Factors: Inflation, Real GDP, Stock Market Volatility and Term Spread” by Joy \nNicdao -Cuyugan and Rochelle Phipps of the Illinois Commerce Commission staff."

Please provide any research \nhe has conducted or documentation he has found to support this assessment.  \n \n Response:  \n \nWitness Quackenbush reaches this conclusion after reading Mr. Ellis’ description of his \ncompetitive direct equity scheme on pages 51 -63 of his Direct Testimony.  Witness Ellis’ scheme \nappears to be a solution for an imagined problem and is based on flawed assumptions about utility management and the regulatory process.    \nThe scheme put forth by Witness Ellis is complicated and unrealistic as it would interrupt the \nway capital markets work by uprooting and replacing the existing capital raising processes for \none industry segment partitioned off for unique treatment, force t he timing of capital markets \ntransactions into narrow windows toward the end of rate cases, require the utility to outsource capital structure decision -making, prevent parent companies from retaining earnings in utility \nsubsidiaries, and force parent compa nies to sell partial stakes of utility subsidiaries.   \nMoreover, the scheme is complicated and unrealistic as it contemplates that a regulator that \nmakes a rate case decision based on a test year revenue requirement is implicitly agreeing to a \nmulti- year capex forecast, and has the legislative authority to administer and oversee capital \nraising as part of its rate case duties, the time available to squeeze extra steps into the rate case \nprocess, and/or the ability and authority to create a new class of regulatory cases outside of  \nrate cases.   \nMr. Ellis acknowledges that his scheme is not “ready for implementation” and that \n“implementation details would be contentious.”"

Does Witness Quackenbush agree that independent academic researchers have \nconcluded that authorized ROEs exceed utilities’ market -based cost of equity, as \nexplained in CURE Exhibit ME -2, p. 10? If he disagrees, please provide any and all \nresearch, internal  or third party, in support of his position. Provide all internal \nanalyses in functional Excel spreadsheets, and all documentation in support of all assumptions.  \n Response:  \n \nMinnesota Power and the Partners object to this request on the grounds that the information \nsought is irrelevant and/or not proportional to the needs of the case.  Further, the materials  \ncited on page 10 of CURE Exhibit ME -2 speak for themselves.   \nSubject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, witness Quackenbush responds as follows:  \nPlease see objection .  However, to the extent that an academic study does reach a conclusion \nthat authorized ROEs exceed the cost of equity, such a conclusion would be driven by the cost of equity estimation model  or model s and inputs chosen by the author.   Separately, \ncommissions consider  and weigh their own extensive multi -faceted evidence when determining \nan authorized ROE."

As a resident in MN\nwho recently switched their heat source to electric-supply, I can attest\nthat doing so greatly increases our monthly heat bills.\nI can only assume that transitioning ownership of MN Power away from\nlocal control will only ultimately increase the cost of electric for\ncustomers, which is a disincentive to transitioning to more electric\nutilization.\nPlease consider blocking this purchase.\nThank you,\nMicah, Minneapolis"

No Party Denied or Refuted the Key Arguments of My Direct Testimony.  4 \nQ. Did any of the witnesses address the core arguments of your direct testimony?  5 \nA. No. For the most part, they ignored them altogether. I  will address the few instances in which 6 \nthey did seek to rebut them, unsuccessfully, below , where I comment on each witness’s 7 \nrebuttal testimony individually.  8 \nQ. What were the core arguments of your direct testimony?  9 \nA. My direct testimony makes several key arguments:  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE 10 \nSECRET DATA BEGINS ] 11 \n   \n  \n   \n [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS ]  \n2. The transaction is an example of, and is entirely predicated on, a systemic, nationwide 16 \nproblem of excessive authorized rates of return  (RORs) .12 17 \n3. By long -standing Supreme Court precedent, the standard for setting ROR  is equal to 18 \nthe market -based cost of capital ( COC ).13 19 \n \n11 Ellis Direct at  7-15. \n12 Id. at 36-40. \n13 Id. at 15-19. \n\n\nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n10 Q. Which , if any,  of these key points of your direct testimony did the witnesses address in 1 \nyour testimony?  2 \nA. Witness Bulkley proposed several potential  alternative explanation s for one of the pieces of 3 \nevidence I cited in support of my argument that RORs exceed COC.20 Upon investigation, 4 \nnone supports her claim; if anything, they prove the opposite.  None of my other points w as 5 \naddressed in any substantive way by any of the witnesses.  6 \nQ. Did the witnesses have access to the data and analysis supporting your testimony  so that 7 \nthey could review and assess them ? 8 \nA. Yes. All of the eight  points above are backed up by various models and analysis. All the 9 \nExcel spreadsheets and data used in my testimony were provided to the witnesses with my 10 \nworkpapers in response to a discovery request. All sources were documented. In discovery, I 11 \nasked the various witnesses  to provide comparable analyses to substantiate their alleged 12 \nshortcomings or flaws in my testimony. They declined to do so.21 13 \nQ. Several parties took exception to your description of  utilities as government -sanctioned 14 \nlicenses to “pick customers’ pockets .”22 Do you have any response?  15 \nA. Witnesses Bram,23 Bulkley,24 and Quackenbush25 all noted my use of this terminology . None 16 \naddressed, denied , refuted , or identified any flaw  in the substance of my argument  that 17 \nexcessive ROEs impose unnecessary costs on customers that redound to the benefit of the 18 \nowners of utilities . They appear to be more concerned with style than substance.  19 \n \n20 Bulkley Rebuttal at 17 -21. \n21 GIP Response to CURE IR  0016 . Attached here as Schedule ME -8.

GIP/CPP WITNESS BULKLEY  1 \nQ. What are the core elements of GIP/CPP Witness Bulkley’s rebuttal testimony, as it 2 \nrelates to your testimony?  3 \nA. In attempting to rebut my testimony, Witness Bulkley makes three claims: market -to-book 4 \nratios greater than 1.0 can be explained by factors other than ROEs greater than COE;26 my 5 \nconcerns about incentives for potential excessive rate base growth and consequent rate 6 \ninflation are unfounded;27 and excessive ROEs are not relevant to the Commission’s decision 7 \nregarding the proposed transaction.28 She also seeks to discredit my testimony by citing 8 \ndecisions from proceedings in which I did not participate or from other jurisdictions.29 9 \nA. Witness Bulkley’s Three Explanations for M/B Ratios greater than 1.0 10 \nActually Prove the Exact Opposite of What She Claims.  11 \nQ. With respect to M/B ratios, what reasons does Witness Bulkley provide to explain why 12 \nutility M/B ratios exceed 1.0?  13 \nA. Witness Bulkley wrote : 14 \nAs I discussed in Minnesota Power’s last rate proceeding, there are several 15 \nreasons why market -to-book ratios exceed 1.0, for example: 1) the operations 16 \nare not 100 percent regulated, 2) the regulatory system includes lag in the 17 \nadjustment of the allowed ROE to the market COE, and 3) the utility’s rate base 18 \nmay not be identical to its GAAP book value.30 19 \n \n26 Bulkley Rebuttal at  18. \n27 Id.  \n28 Id. at 19. \n29 Bulkley Rebuttal at  19-21. \n30 Bulkley Rebuttal at  18. Witness Bulkley cited her rebuttal testimony in MP’s last rate case . \nThat rebuttal testimony is not available on the Commission’s website, and Witness Bulkley did \nnot produce it when requested during discovery.  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n12 Q. Did Witness Bulkley provide any research, analysis, or other documentation in support 1 \nof her assertions?  2 \nA. When asked to substantiate these explanations with research, analysis, or other support, 3 \nWitness Bulkley conceded she “does not have  any research, analysis or third party [sic] that 4 \ndemonstrates that these three factors account for all of the difference between market and 5 \nbook valu e.” In fact, Witness Bulkley could not  provide research, analysis , or other support 6 \nthat these factors could account for any of the difference.31 In so admitting a lack of support 7 \nfor her statements, Witness Bulkley admits she made up these three factors with out any basis.  8 \nQ. Do any of the three reasons support Witness Bulkley’s argument?  9 \nA. Witness Bulkley does not cite any research nor provide any analysis in support of her 10 \nreasons : they are mere speculation. Upon examination, none of the three reasons provided 11 \nsupports her argument.  12 \nThe effect of the latter two proposed reasons – regulatory lag and differences between rate base 13 \nand GAAP book value – both tend to reduce, not increase, M/B ratios, contradicting Witness 14 \nBulkley’s argument. As I explain below, t he validity of the first reason can be assessed by 15 \nlooking at the M/B ratios of utilities whose operations are close to 100%, removing any 16 \npotential effect of non -utility operations. Among those companies, M/B ratios far exceed 1.0. 17 \nIn combination with the findings on the effects of regulatory lag and differences between rate 18 \nbase and GAAP book value, “pure play” M/B ratios significantly greater than 1.0 19 \nunequivocally refute Witness Bulkley’s contention that utility market M/B ratios can be 20 \nexplained by non -utility operations.  21 \n \n31 Schedule ME -11.  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n13 Q. How does regulatory lag affect M/B?  1 \nA. As S&P explains, “‘Regulatory lag’ occurs when a utility's commission -approved revenue 2 \nrequirement does not reflect its true cost of providing service and can compromise the 3 \ncompany’ s ability to earn its authorized ROE.”32 A lower ROE would tend to reduce utility 4 \nprofits and therefore decrease utility market values and M/B ratios – the exact opposite of the 5 \neffect Witness Bulkley claims.  6 \nQ. How do differences between rate base and GAAP book value affect M/B?  7 \nA. Witness Bulkley is correct that rate base generally differs from GAAP book value. As S&P 8 \nexplains in a recent report on the calculation of rate base,33 common additions, which would 9 \nincrease rate base relative to GAAP book value, can include equipment inventories, cash 10 \nworking capital, and regulatory assets like construction work in progress (CWIP). Common 11 \ndeductions include customer deposits, contributions in aid of construction, and accumulated 12 \ndeferred income taxes (ADIT), which are considered cost -free capital for the utility.  13 \nTypically, the deduction for ADIT is larger than all additions combined. Consequently, rate 14 \nbase tends to be lower than GAAP book value. In the three “real world examples” provided 15 \nin S&P’s report, for example, rate base ranges from 74% to 87% of net utility plant, and 16 \nADIT accounts for 65% to 114% of net deductions.34 17 \n \n32 Russell Ernst and Monica Hlinka, Focusing on Common Questions can Shed Light on Utility \nRegulatory Practices , S&P Global (Aug .10, 2023) , https://www.spglobal.com/market -\nintelligence/en/news -insights/research/focusing -on-common -questions -can-shed-light-on-\nutility -regulatory -practices .  \n33 Russell Ernst and Monica Hlinka, Rate Base: It's More Complicated than it Sounds , S&P \nGlobal (July 8, 2024).  \n34 Id. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n14 If rate base value is less than book value, an authorized ROE=COE would result in an expected 1 \nrealized return below the market -based COE,35 causing the market value to drop below book 2 \nvalue, i.e., M/B would be less than 1.0. Differences between rate base and GAAP book value 3 \ntend to reduce, not increase, M/B – again, the exact opposite of Witness Bulkley’s claim.  4 \nQ. What is the M/B of “pure play” utilities?  5 \nA. In Docket No. E015/GR -23-155, Witness Bulkley provided direct testimony on behalf of MP  6 \nregarding ROE . That analysis entailed “establish[ing] a group of companies that are both 7 \npublicly traded and comparable to [MP] in certain fundamental business and financial 8 \nrespects to serve as its ‘proxy’ in the cost of equity estimation process.”36 In other words, 9 \nthese companies were selected to reflect, as closely as possible, a pure electric utility like MP 10 \nwith minimal non -utility operations.37 11 \nAs of the time of Ms. Bulkley’s analysis of the proxy group companies’ COE, September 2023, 12 \ntheir market -to-book ratios averaged 2.0; as of February 2025, their M/B ratios averaged 13 \n2.3.38 The proxy group companies were expressly chosen by Witness Bulkley for their 14 \nabsence of non -utility operations. Their M/B ratios in excess of 1.0 therefore cannot be 15 \nexplained by non -utility operations. Witness Bulkley’s own hand -picked proxy group 16 \ndisproves her claim.  17 \n \n35 COE x rate base equity value < COE x equity book value.  \n36 Minnesota Power, Direct Testimony of Anne E.

What can we conclude from your investigation of Witness Bulkley’s claims about the 1 \nreasons for why utility M/B ratios exceed 1.0?  2 \nA. Among companies specifically chosen by Ms. Bulkley for their similarity to an electric utility 3 \n“pure play” like Minnesota Power, the M/B ratio far exceeds 1.0. This premium cannot be 4 \nattributed to either of the other two potential factors identified by Witness Bulkley – 5 \nregulatory lag and differences between rate base and GAAP book value, both of which tend 6 \nto reduce utilities’ M/B ratios.  7 \nWitness Bulkley provides no other explanatory factors for utility M/B ratios greater than 1.0. It 8 \nshould be noted that  Witness Quackenbush also recognizes  that “market -to-book ratios 9 \n[above  1.0] … represent a significant deviation [in ROE] from the cost of equity , which is a 10 \nmarket -based, forward -looking concept .”39 We can only conclude, therefore, that excessive 11 \nROEs are the key factor accounting for utilities’ M/B premium.  12 \nB. Witness Bulkley’s Attempts to Dismiss Concerns About Incentives for 13 \nExcessive Rate Base and Customer Rate Growth Are Similarly 14 \nUncompelling.  15 \nQ. How does Witness Bulkley attempt to dismiss your concern about incentives for 16 \nexcessive rate base growth and consequent rate inflation?  17 \nA. Witness Bulkley states : “To the extent growth opportunities exist with respect to the 18 \nadditional investments necessary for Minnesota Power to transition to cleaner energy and 19 \nmeet the State Carbon Free standard, these are only carried out and/or recovered from 20 \ncustomers with Commission approval.”40 21 \n \n39 MP response to CURE IR 0024.

How does Witness Bulkley attempt to address your concern about GIP/CPP’s incentives 9 \nto inflate rate base?  10 \nA. As I explained in my direct testimony, whenever authorized ROE exceeds COE, utilities have 11 \na financial incentive to grow rate base as much as possible, and the greater the ROE -COE 12 \ndifferential, the more powerful the incentive.42 I then provide substantial, robust evidence 13 \nthat ROEs across the US utility sector far exceed COE.43 [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 14 \nTRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]   \n  \n [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET DATA ENDS]  18 \nWitness Bulkley is silent on the first and third points.

In Claiming the Difference Between ROE and COE Is Not Relevant to This 8 \nProceeding, Witness Bulkley Would Have Us Ignore the Elephant in the 9 \nRoom.  10 \nQ. How do you respond to Witness Bulkley’s claim that the difference between ROE and 11 \nCOE is not relevant to this proceeding?47 12 \nA. Frankly, this is a nonsensical statement. All parties and stakeholders acknowledge in some 13 \nway that MP’s profits are relevant in assessing the merits of the transaction and that ROE is a 14 \nkey determinant of MP’s profits. It is also undisputed that the legal standard established in 15 \nHope  requires ROE to be set equal to COE. The difference between ROE and COE is the 16 \n“why?” of the entire transaction. In denying this , Witness Bulkley is asking everyone to 17 \nignore the elephant in the room.  18 \nWitness Bulkley’s very participation in this proceeding betrays her argument. She maintains that 19 \nROE should only be evaluated “in the context of base rate proceedings.”48 Of the fourteen 20 \ntopics covered by various experts in MP’s last rate proceeding, just two are also covered in 21 \n \n47 Bulkley Rebuttal at  19. \n48 Id. \n\nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n19 this proceeding: ROE and cost of capital.49 Witness Bulkley would appear to have us believe 1 \nGIP/CPP paid her to provide testimony on ROE that is actually not relevant to the 2 \ntransaction.  3 \nWitness Bulkley’s direct testimony in this proceeding discusses the same Hope  ROR=COC 4 \nstandard on which my testimony is based.50 ROE and the ROR=COC standard are relevant to 5 \nboth general rate cases and this proceeding.  6 \nD. Witness Bulkley ’s References to Other Proceedings Are Not Relevant to This 7 \nProceeding.  8 \nQ. How does Witness Bulkley attempt to discredit your argument that MP’s authorized 9 \nROE exceeds its COE?  10 \nA. After denying the relevance of the difference between ROE and COE, as described above, 11 \nWitness Bulkley’s rebuttal of my testimony continues with a litany of strawman arguments 12 \nand other logical fallacies  having nothing to do with the three main arguments of my 13 \ntestimony summarized above. While not self -impugning like her M/B ratio argument, they 14 \nare no more compelling.  15 \nQ. Can you give example s of th ese strawman arguments ? 16 \nA. Witness Bulkley begins by asserting, “The appropriate ROE for Minnesota Power is not 17 \naffected by the Acquisition and neither Minnesota Power nor the Partners has proposed to 18 \nmake a change.”51 This is a mischaracterization of the issue, nowhere in my testimony do I 19 \nsuggest this docket would be used to change Minnesota Power’s ROE . Rather, I observe that 20 \n \n49 Id.  \n50 MP Ex.____, Direct Testimony of Ann E. Bulkley , at 6-10 (“Bulkley Direct”).  Witness  Bulkley \nrefers to “rate of return” and “cost of capital” synonymously, implicitly recognizing the \nROR=COC standard.  \n51 Id. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n20 MP’s ROE is too high, regardless of whether the transaction proceeds. This is a longstanding 1 \nissue that predates the proposed transaction but provides the justification for why it would be 2 \nprofitable  for GIP/CPP despite the ir $1.5-billion acquisition premium . 3 \nWitness Bulkley follows with, “The Commission should continue to evaluate the COE in the 4 \ncontext of base rate proceedings and use that information to inform their decision on the 5 \nappropriate ROE to be authorized for Minnesota Power at that time.”52 Again, my testimony 6 \nonly requests the Commission address MP’s excessive ROE within its regulatory aut horities; 7 \nit does not say anything about the administrative process for doing so. The Commission has 8 \nmany opportunities to revisit this issue and address the imbalance.  9 \nQ. Are Witness Bulkley’s references to prior Commission decisions relevant to this 10 \nproceeding or your testimony?  11 \nA. No. Witness Bulkley next highlights filings from two prior Commission proceedings in 12 \nwhich I did not participate. The first transparently attempts to lump my arguments with a 13 \ndifferent analysis that is unrelated to my testimony : “The Commission [has] already 14 \nconsidered and rejected testimony similar to that … offered by Witnesses Ellis and Addonizio 15 \nregarding the difference between the COE and the ROE,” citing a passage addressing 16 \nDepartment Witness Addonizio’s discussion of a specific model assumption in MP’s last rate 17 \ncase.53 The Commission language quoted and emphasized there is commenting on a specific 18 \n \n52 Id. \n53 Id. at 19-20.

My direct testimony in this 1 \nproceeding does not discuss that model or the specific assumption in question.  2 \nThe second passage cited by Witness Bulkley, from 2014, is transparently self -contradictory:  3 \nStill, investors, analysts, utilities and regulators understand this difference [between 4 \nROE and COE] and factor it into their decision -making. And, as the Department and 5 \nthe Company pointed out, if utilities were in fact earning excessive profits due to 6 \nexcessive returns on equity, there would have been a run on utility stocks, eliminating 7 \nexcessive profits —the utility sector is not so removed from the rest of the economy that 8 \nbasic economic principles do not apply.54 9 \nThis characterization fails to recognize that the hypothetical “run on utility stocks” the 10 \nquoted Commission  language so readily dismisses is exactly what has taken place, precisely 11 \nbecause the market -based COE is less than ROE. In bidding up the price of utility stocks 12 \nabove book value, “eliminating [the] excessive profits” of excess ROEs, investors reveal 13 \nthrough their decision -making that ROE is greater than the market -based COE. If this is not 14 \nthe “run on utility stocks” that Witness Bulkley denies has happened, what is? M/B>1.0 is the 15 \nvery signature of such a run.  16 \nQ. Are Witness Bulkley’s references to other state utility regulatory decisions relevant to 17 \nthis proceeding?  18 \nA. Witness Bulkley concludes her rebuttal of my testimony by observing, “Witness Ellis 19 \nrecently provided very similar testimony in a Duke Energy Progress proceeding in North 20 \nCarolina,” citing the North Carolina Public Utilities Commission (NCPUC):  21 \nEllis’s outcome of 6.25% … is scarcely 200 basis points above DEP’s embedded cost 22 \nof debt, a premium that is clearly insufficient to compensate investors for the added 23 \nrisk associated with equity ownership relative to a debtholder’s claim on the same 24 \nenterprise.55 25 \n \n54 Id. at 20.

Both Duke and the NCPUC chose simply to dismiss my testimony without  12 \nengag ing substantively with the arguments, analysis, and evidence I presented, just as 13 \nWitness Bulkley and the other GIP/CPP witnesses are proposing the factfinders do in this 14 \nproceeding.  15 \n \n56 Ellis Direct at 33.  \n57 Id. at 33. \n58 Scott Hempling, Effective Regulatory Procedures: Purposes, Practices and Paths , Australian \nCompetition & Commerce Commission/Australian Energy Regulator Conference (Aug. 2016), \n16, \nhttps://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Presentation%20by%20Scott%20Hempling%2C%20Attor\nney%20at%20Law%2C%20Maryland%20%2C%20USA%2C%20commentator%20on%20the%\n20Effective%20Regulation%20of%20Public%20Utilities.pdf  (“Regulatory capture is evidenced \nby is a surplus of passivity and reactivity, along with deficit of curiosity and creativity.” ).  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n23 Q. Please summarize your conclusions regarding Witness Bulkley’s rebuttal of your direct 1 \ntestimony.  2 \nA. Witness Bulkley attempts to discredit testimony by dismissing my concerns about incentives 3 \nfor potential excessive rate base growth and consequent rate inflation; questioning the 4 \nrelevance of excessive ROEs to the transaction; and citing decisions from proceedings in 5 \nwhich I did not participate or from other jurisdictions.59 For the most part, Witness Bulkley 6 \ndoes not engage substantively with the arguments, analysis, and evidence presented in my 7 \ntestimony. Instead, her arguments are a combination of unsubstantiated assertions, 8 \nmisrepresentations , and citations to other proceedings that are irrelevant or in which the 9 \nregulator ’s reasoning was clearly flawed. In the one instance in which she does attempt to 10 \naddress the substance, utility M/B ratios, the financial  evidence supports the exact opposite 11 \nof what she claims.  12 \nIV. CPP WI TNESS ALLEY  13 \nQ. What are the core elements of CPP Witness Alley’s rebuttal testimony, as it relates to 14 \nyour testimony ? 15 \nA. Witness Alley’s rebuttal attempts to address the main argument of my testimony: that 16 \nGIP/CPP’s acquisition of MP is not in the public interest because GIP/CPP have powerful 17 \nfinancial incentives to grow MP’s rate base and, therefore, customer rates as fast as possible. 18 \nWitness Alley is apparently unable to address the substance of my arguments, as he instead 19 \nresorts to semantic word games and misrepresentation of easily verified facts.  20 \n \n59 Bulkley Rebuttal at  19-21. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n24 A. Witness Alley Misrepresents the Reasons My Direct Testimony Provides for 1 \nWhy GIP/CPP’s Acquisition of MP Is Not in the Public Interest.  2 \nQ. What does Witness Alley claim are your reasons for believing GIP/CPP’ acquisition of 3 \nMP is not in the public interest?  4 \nA. Witness Alley states, “Witness Ellis asserts that there is a conflict between the Partners’ 5 \nincentive to increase return on equity and the public interest in cost -effective utility service at 6 \njust and reasonable returns on equity, which he characterizes as a ‘toxic combination.’”60 He 7 \nthen attempts to dismiss this concern by asserting, “The Acquisition will not change the 8 \nfoundational principle that owners of a business expect a return on their investments.”61 9 \nQ. Is this an accurate characterization of your reason for objecting to the transaction ? 10 \nA. No, it is not. While I agree that to “increase return on equity” above the cost of equity is not 11 \nin the public interest – which Witness Alley here implicitly admits GIP/CPP would do if 12 \npermitted – I did not testify that GIP/CPP should not be allowed to earn a return at all on 13 \ntheir investment. Earning a reasonable profit is entirely consistent with cost -of-service 14 \nregulation, and is desirable.  15 \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]   \n  \n  \n [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS]   \nWitness Alley evades both my concerns – about MP’s ROE in excess of its COE and 20 \nGIP/CPP’s financial incentives to grow rate base in a manner adverse to the public interest.  21 \n \n60 MP Ex. ____, Rebuttal Testimony of Andrew Alley,  at 26 (“Alley Rebuttal”) . \n61 Id. at 27. \n\nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n25 Q. Is GIP/CPP’s MP investment forecast excessive and adverse to  the public interest?  1 \nA. Yes, GIP/CPP’s MP investment forecast is excessive and not in the public interest.

It is important to recognize, 20 \nhowever, that it is possible that rates will go up in the future. If that happens, it will not 21 \nbe because of the Partners.

How does Witness Alley address your concerns about GIP/CPP’s buy -build -bail 3 \nstrategy?  4 \nA. Witness Alley does not directly address my concern, once again resorting to evasive word 5 \ngames. For example, he states:  6 \nThe Partners’ reasons for investing in ALLETE and Minnesota Power, and their long - 7 \nterm investment strategies, differ from private equity strategies that seek to extract 8 \neconomic value from the acquisition using short -term strategies that are not intended 9 \nto leave the acquired company better off.66 10 \nNotice the inclusion of the final phrase, “that are not intended to leave the acquired company 11 \nbetter off.” This is not the issue that most impacts the public interest in this acquisition. My 12 \nobjection to the transaction is not because I believe that GIP/CPP will leave MP worse off, 13 \nbut that they will leave MP customers dramatically worse off.  14 \nQ. How does Witness Alley respond to concerns about CPP’s intended MP holding period , 15 \nas represented in CPP’s final investment review presentation?  16 \nA. Witness Alley explains:  17 \nI want to provide context regarding what the presentation relied on by DOC Witness 18 \nAddonizio and CURE Witness Baker is, and what it is not. Any time CPP Investments 19 \nconsiders making an investment, it is required to obtain internal approvals. In order to 20 \nobtain that approval, CPP Investments prepares a model and accompanying 21 \npresentation that analyzes the potential investment in detail, including numerous 22 \ndifferent scenarios to consider a range of possible outcomes. These different scenarios 23 \nnecessarily include different periods in which CPP Investments may exit an investment, 24 \nas well as scenarios in which CPP Investments holds an investment in perpetuity. This 25 \nanalysis is conducted at a single point in time and is based on the best information that 26 \nCPP Investments has as of that time. It is not meant to accurately predict the outcome 27 \nof any given investment. It is simply a tool that CPP Investments, and other similar 28 \ninvestors, use to evaluate a potential investment and to get approval to move forward 29 \n \n66 Alley Rebuttal at  3. \n\nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n28 with the understanding that any of the possible outcomes analyzed may or may not 1 \ncome to fruition.67 2 \nThe misrepresentations in this passage are particularly egregious.

The first is a strawman – attributing to me an easily refuted argument that I 15 \nnever made. Witness Bram refers to “generalized fears of private equity that are expressed in 16 \nthe Direct Testimony of some Parties,” including my testimony in his citation s.72 In my 17 \ntestimony,  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]   18 \n  \n  \n \n71 Bram Rebuttal at 38.  \n72 Id. at 4. \n\nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n31  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS] I am care ful,  \nthough, to clarify that my critique is limited to the traditional private equity compensation 2 \nstructure , which encourages excessive investment and rate increases that are not in the public 3 \ninterest,74 and not private equity in general : [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE 4 \nSECRET DATA BEGINS]  5 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n           \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS]  17 \nIn fact, my testimony includes a detailed discussion of the constructive role private equity 18 \ncould play in reducing customer costs, providing attractive returns for investors, and helping 19 \nto address the nation’s retirement savings crisis.76 20 \nQ. What is another example of Witness Bram’s rhetorical sleight of hand ? 21 \nA. Witness Bram continues,  again citing my testimony:  22 \nTextbook descriptions suggesting that private equity concepts or investment strategies 23 \nwill force higher returns by taking control of the operations and financing of the 24 \ncompanies they acquire are not applicable to the Partners’ investments in the Company . 25 \nThese arguments might apply  to some traditional private equity investments that rely 26 \n \n73 Ellis Direct at  7-10. \n74 Id. at 25 -43. \n75 Id. at 41. Emphasis  in original.   \n76 Id. at 51-63. \n\nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n32 heavily on debt leveraging, cost  cutting operational changes, and asset sales to generate 1 \nentity value.77 2 \nNowhere in my testimony do I discuss debt leveraging, cost cutting operational changes, or 3 \nassets sales.  4 \nCuriously, Witness Bram in the very next sentence concedes that GIP/CPP do inten d to 5 \nimplement the v ery strategy that is the source of my concern : 6 \nBut these general  arguments do not apply to infrastructure capital investments like our 7 \ninvestment in ALLETE where value is driven by other factors like long -term growth 8 \nopportunities and supportive regulatory environments .78 9 \nThe traditional private equity model’s powerful incentives for excessive investment in “long - 10 \nterm growth opportunities,” facilitated by a “supportive regulatory environment” is the 11 \ncentral issue in this transaction that makes it not in the public interest. At no point does 12 \nWitness Bram refute or deny my claim  that GIP/CPP do, in fact, face these powerful 13 \nincentives.  14 \nQ. Is there a third example of Witness Bram’s rhetorical sleight of hand?  15 \nA. Yes. Later in his rebuttal , Witness Bram  claims:  16 \nCURE Witness Ellis takes multiple positions that are at odds with state regulatory 17 \ncommissions, including the Commission, one of which is that the Acquisition cannot 18 \nbe consistent with the public interest because it results in private gain.79 19 \nThis is a vague claim at best. If Witness Bram is claiming that GIP/CPP, or any other 20 \nacquirer, are not allowed any “private gain,” again, I make no such assertion in my testimony.  21 \nIf he is  referring to the owners of ALLETE’s publicly traded stock, I also made no claim that 22 \nthey are not entitled to a capital gain  on the transaction . For some time,  ALLETE has been 23 \n \n77 Bram Rebuttal at  5. \n78 Id. \n79 Id. at 38. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n33 reinvesting some of ALLETE shareholders’ return, on their behalf, to grow MP’s rate base. If 1 \nMP is sold, ALLETE shareholders  are entitled to benefit from this increase in MP’s rate base , 2 \nwhich would be seen as a capital gain  for them.  Nowhere in my direct testimony do I refer to 3 \nALLETE’s public shareholders. I clarify at the outset that my testimony focuses exclusively 4 \non the acquisition and ownership of MP.80 5 \nIf Witness Bram  is referring to MP as the owner of its utility assets , he is correct that no capital 6 \ngain (over rate base value) is  consistent with the public interest. MP has  already been more 7 \nthan suitably rewarded in the form o f MP’s authorized ROE ; any gain over rate base value is 8 \ninconsistent with the Hope  ROR=COC standard , an u nearned windfall at the expense of 9 \ncustomers as described in my direct testimony.81 I will explain in more detail this ineluctable 10 \nlogical implication of Hope  later in this testimony.  11 \nQ. Are there any other examples of Witness Bram’s rhetorical sleight of hand?  12 \nA. Yes. I will describe one more, a strawman argument that opens a lengthy, and flawed, 13 \ndiscussion of dividend payouts to investors. Witness Bram continues:  14 \nWitness Ellis’ proposal would require investors to rely solely on dividends to earn a 15 \nreturn, which would be detrimental to the utility’s business and stands in stark contrast 16 \nto the Partners’ [GIP/CPP ’s] approach of forgoing dividends to reinvest in the utility to 17 \nprovide longer term growth and value.  18 \n… 19 \n \n80 Ellis Direct at  5 (“The purpose of my testimony is to contribute constructively to the record in \norder to assist the Commission in addressing several issues relevant to its decision in this case, \nthe proposed sale of Minnesota Power (MP), a regulated utility that is part of ALLETE, to \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners (GIP ) and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board \n(CPP).” ).  \n81 Id. at 16-19, 22. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n34 Just as public stockholders often earn part of their return by eventually selling 1 \npurchased stock , we invest in portfolio companies for the same reason others make 2 \ninvestments: to earn a return from the investment .82 3 \nWitness Bram appears to be conflating the perspectives of ALLETE’s public shareholders – 4 \nwhose return is not limited to dividends, as explained above – and that of GIP/CPP as private 5 \nowners of MP. If so, Witness Bram’s argument betrays a troubling ignorance of basic utility 6 \ncost-of-service regulatory principles.  7 \nQ. What does Witness Bram appear to misunderstand about utility cost -of-service 8 \nregulation?  9 \nA. “Return” for the direct owners of  utility – as ALLETE currently is, and GIP/CPP would be , 10 \nof MP  – refers only to net income (or profit , or earnings); utilities are not entitled nor, in 11 \nprinciple under Hope , allowed to profit from a capital gain on their investment. Net income 12 \ncan be distributed to investors in the form of dividends or reinvested in the utility, which 13 \nwould increase rate base value and future dividends. Nothing in my “proposal” (presumably 14 \nto set ROE equal to COE) suggests investors cannot reinvest a portion, or even all, of their 15 \nnet income back into the utility; dividends can be as high or low as MP management deems 16 \nnecessary or desirable.  17 \nIn discovery Witness Bram was asked to substantiate his claim that investors ’ sole reliance on 18 \ndividends to earn a return , without any capital gain,  would be detrimental to the utility’s 19 \nbusiness. He was unable to do so.83 20 \nQ. What is an example of Witness Bram’s logically flawed arguments?  21 \nA. Later , Witness Bram resumes  his discussion of dividends : 22 \n \n82 Bram Rebuttal at  38. \n83 Schedule ME -10.  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n35 If the owner of a utility, whether a publicly traded utility with public shareholders or a 1 \nprivately held utility, cannot earn a profit from the sale of its ownership interest, it will 2 \nneed to increase the return during its ownership.84 3 \nThere are several flaws in statement. Again, Witness Bram is conflating the perspectives of 4 \npublic shareholders and private owners. As explained, public shareholders may expect to earn 5 \na portion of their return as a capital gain if the company has been reinvesting a share of their 6 \nearnings in rate base. Also as explained, the direct owners of a utility are not entitled to earn a 7 \nprofit, above rate base value, from the sale of their ownership interest; any capital gain would 8 \nbe an excess return that is unearned, unwarranted, and unfair to consumers.85 They would not 9 \nneed to increase their return, because, by definition of ROE, they have already been suitably 10 \ncompensated.  11 \nQ. Why is ROE alone a sufficient , and just and reasonable , return for the direct owners of 12 \na utility ? 13 \nA. A comparison to a bond illustrates this basic financial principle. When an investor buys, say, 14 \na 5-year Treasury bond, collects all the periodic interest payments and their principal at the 15 \nend of the bond’s life, they are fairly compensated. They purchase the bond in full knowledge 16 \n \n84 Bram Rebuttal at  39. \n85 See FPC v. Hope Gas Co. , 320 U.S. 591 , 603 (1944)  (“From the investor or company point of \nview it is important that there be enough revenue not only for operating expenses but also for \nthe capital costs of the business. These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock. \nBy that standard the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with  returns on \ninvestments in other enterprises having corresponding risks. ”); See also  Bluefield Co. v. Pub. \nServ. Comm. , 262 U.S. 679 , 692-93 (1923)  (“A public utility is entitled to such rates as will \npermit it to earn a return on the value of the property which it employs for the convenience of \nthe public equal to that generally being made at the same time ... on investments in other \nbusiness undertaki ngs which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties; but it has \nno constitutional right to profits such as are realized or anticipated in highly profitable \nenterprises or speculative ventures .”).  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n36 that all they will get in return is the interest payments and return of their principal. No capital 1 \ngain at the end is required to entice them to invest.  2 \nThis is the standard set by the Supreme Court. As articulated in Hope , a utility’s authorized ROE 3 \nis the entire reasonable return required by investors to attract capital and compensate 4 \ninvestors for the risks they take in investing in the utility. No additional return, in the form of 5 \na capital gain, is needed, nor, according to Hope , allowed.86 6 \nQ. Is that the only flaw in Witness Bram’s discussion of MP dividends?  7 \nA. No. Witness Bram ’s faulty reasoning  continues:  8 \nThis would be in the form of dividends from the utility, particularly in the context of 9 \npublic shareholders, meaning the utility would need to pay out more of its earnings and 10 \nreinvest less. It would also place an even greater emphasis on short -term gains through 11 \ndividends, magnifying the volatility of the stock.  … It would be very detrimental to 12 \nMinnesota Power’s access to capital if investors – whether public or private –would 13 \nonly ever see dividends.87 14 \nThere are several flaws in this argument. First, GIP/CPP are taking MP private, so the 15 \n“context of public shareholders” is not relevant.  16 \nSecond, Witness Bram again confuses dividends with return (i.e., ROE). Whether the utility pays 17 \nall of its net income or retains and reinvests  a fraction or even  all of it, the ROE is the same . 18 \nIn principle, if ROE equals COE , the return to investors should  also be the same.  That 19 \nWitness Bram  acknowledges , even expects, that, in practice, ROE and the return to investors 20 \nare not equal  is telling, a topic I will address later in my testimony.  21 \nThird, in discovery Witness Bram was asked to substant iate his claim that higher dividend 22 \npayouts ( which, once again, are not concomitant with my ROE=COE proposal) would 23 \n \n86 Ellis Direct at 16 -19. \n87 Bram Rebuttal at  39. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n37 increase stock volatility. He declined  to do so.88 Utilit ies consistently maintain among the 1 \nhighest dividend payout ratio s of any industry89 but their stocks are among the least 2 \nvolatile .90 It is difficult to understand why Witness Bram thinks high dividends would be 3 \nviewed negatively by investors.  4 \nFinally, it’s not clear why stock volatility should be considered in this transaction  at all , given 5 \nthat ALLETE and MP will not be publicly traded if the transaction proceeds . When given the 6 \nchance, Witness Bram declined to explain .91 7 \nB. Witness Bram’s Revealed Ignorance of Utility Regulatory Principles 8 \nHighlights the Ineluctable Fatal Flaw of This Transaction.  9 \nQ. Previously, you said that Witness Bram ’s acknowledge ment , even expect ation , that, in 10 \npractice, ROE and the return to investors are not equal is telling . Please explain.  11 \nA. In the foregoing arguments , Witness Bram does not recognize the difference between 12 \nALLETE public shareholders and direct ownership of MP . He clearly expects both 13 \nALLLETE and GIP/CPP to “ earn a profit from the sale  of”92 and to “earn part of their return 14 \nby eventually selling”93 their ownership interest  in MP. In doing so, he implicitly agrees with 15 \none of the main arguments of my direct testimony.94 16 \nThere, I demonstrated  that MP’s value to investors can exceed rate base  – i.e., investor s can only 17 \nearn a portion of their return from the eventual sale of MP  – if and only if ROE exceeds 18 \n \n88 Schedule ME -10.  \n89 See, e.g. , ReadyRatios, https://www.readyratios.com/sec/ratio/dividend -payout/ .  \n90 See, e.g. , Dividend Fundamentals by Sector, \nhttps://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/divfund.html .  \n91 Schedule ME -10. \n92 Bram Rebuttal at 39.  \n93 Id. at 38.  \n94 Ellis Direct at 29.  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n38 COE, regardless of how much (or little) they invest.95 In discovery Witness Bram was asked 1 \nto provide any analysis, research, or other documentation to disprove this point. He declined 2 \nto do so.96 3 \nIf the only way GIP/CPP can meet their return targets is for ROE to continue to exceed COE, the 4 \ntransaction violates Hope  and Minnesota’s regulatory compact.  5 \n1. The proposed transaction is a per se violation of Hope and Minnesota’ s 6 \nregulatory compact.  7 \nQ. Does this transaction comply with Minnesota’s regulatory compact?  8 \nA. No, this transaction transparently violates Minnesota’s regulatory compact.  9 \nMinnesota, like many other states, interprets Hope ’s “just and reasonable” requirement in its 10 \nregulatory compact as entitling utilities “to recover the proven cost of service, plus a 11 \nreasonable return”97 equal to the cost of capital.98 GIP/CPP’s acquisition premium, i.e., the 12 \namount of the purchase price in excess of MP’s book equity value, is neither a “proven cost 13 \nof service” nor a “reasonable return,” and therefore should not be recoverable from 14 \ncustomers . 15 \nMP is entitled to recover its outstanding proven recoverable capital costs, i.e., its rate base;99 16 \nthat is not in dispute. MP is also entitled to recover a reasonable return on its rate base for as 17 \nlong as it carries those past capital expenditures, net of depreciation and amortization. MP 18 \n \n95 Id. at 22-24. \n96 Schedule ME -8.  \n97 See, e.g. , Will Seuffert and Mike Bull, “Public Utilities Commission: Agency and Budget \nOverview,” Minnesota Public Utilities Commission ( March 6, 2025), 6; \nhttps://www.house.mn.gov/comm/docs/f -JIrNM6Qk2Bm1GKaiuH_w.pdf .  \n98 Ellis Direct  at 17-18. \n99 Some of MP’s capital costs have already been recovered in the form of depreciation and \namortization.  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n39 has already been awarded, and has recovered, a reasonable return for carrying those capital 1 \ncosts up to now, in the form of past profits.  2 \nIn selling, MP shareholders will no longer be carrying those capital costs. There is no scope 3 \nor provision in Minnesota’s regulatory compact to award utilities a return for assets they no 4 \nlonger own. MP’s current shareholders are not entitled to any return on assets they no longer 5 \nown. MP is therefore not entitled to any additional return on its rate base beyond what it has 6 \nalready received. Returns and profits are of course allowed, double recovery on already - 7 \ncollected profit is not.  8 \nBecause the acquisition premium is neither a “proven recoverable cost” nor a “reasonable 9 \nreturn,” it is a double payment to MP shareholders to which they are not entitled. The 10 \nacquisition premium therefore violates Minnesota’s regulatory compact.  11 \n2. The $1.5 -billion transaction premium will ultimately be paid by MP 12 \ncustomers . 13 \nQ. But GIP/CPP are paying the acquisition premium. Why should the Commission care 14 \nthat GIP/CPP are willing to pay a premium over rate base?  15 \nA. GIP/CPP are not paying $1.5 billion over rate base value out of the goodness of their hearts, 16 \nand certainly not in order to lose that investment; doing so would be a breach of their 17 \nfiduciary duty to their investors. The acquisition premium, plus a return, will ultimately be 18 \npaid by MP customers . 19 \nQ. How do customers ultimately pay for the acquisition premium?  20 \nA. In acquiring MP, GIP/CPP are making an investment, paying up front for MP’s stream of 21 \nfuture cash flows. The key determinants of MP’s future cash flows are forecast rate base and 22 \nthe expected Commission -authorized ROE.  23 \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n40 In my direct testimony, I proved that the only way GIP would be willing to pay a premium to 1 \nMP’s rate base value is if the ROE exceeded the COE – i.e., unless the ROE violated the 2 \nHope  requirement that ROE be set equal to COE – regardless of the rate at which rate base is 3 \nexpected to grow.100 No witness has questioned, found fault with, or rebutted that analysis or 4 \nits conclusions. Rather, they have simply asserted that MP shareholders are entitled to a 5 \npremium,101 which, as I have just explained, is in violation of Minnesota’s regulatory 6 \ncompact. The fact that GIP/CPP are willing to pay twice MP’s book equity value therefore is 7 \nprima facie proof that MP’s expected ROE exceeds its COE.  8 \nGIP/CPP’s acquisition premium is the present value, discounted at MP’s COE, of the excess 9 \ncustomer costs arising from an authorized ROE in excess of MP’s COE.102 Customers w ould 10 \ntherefore effectively repay in rates the premium over rate base that GIP/CPP are paying to 11 \nacquire MP.  12 \nQ. Is MP entitled to pass through the excess costs arising from excess ROEs to customers?  13 \nA. Not under the public  interes t standards applicable here. As established by Hope , an ROE 14 \ngreater than COE is not a reasonable return, and MP is therefore not entitled to recover these 15 \ncosts from customers under Minnesota’s regulatory compact.  16 \nQ. Aren’t you assuming th at the COE used  in GIP/CPP’s valuation s is the competitive, 17 \nmarket -based COE ? 18 \nA. Yes, I am. A basic principle of finance is that the cost of capital is based on the risk profile of 19 \nthe asset itself – MP in this case – not the provider of the capital.103 20 \n \n100 Ellis Direct at 22 -24. \n101 Bram  Rebuttal at 38 -39; Alley  Rebuttal at 26 -30. \n102 Ellis Direct at 21 n. 26.  \n103 Bulkley Rebuttal at 16.  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n41 In addition, as ALLETE disclosed in its notice to shareholders of a special voting meeting 1 \nseeking approval of the proposed transaction , it conducted a competitive sales process in 2 \nwhich multiple parties participated.104 3 \nWhile we don’t know the market -based cost of equity implied in GIP/CPP’s financial 4 \nanalysis,105 the mere fact that they are willing to pay more than rate base is, on its face, 5 \nevidence that the market -based COE is less than MP’s expected ROE.  6 \nQ. What are the implications of your argument that this transaction violates Minnesota’s 7 \nregulatory compact?  8 \nA. There are two key implications, one general and one specific to this transaction. The first is 9 \nthat any acquisition that entails a premium over rate base value necessarily violates the Hope  10 \nrequirement that the rate of return equal the cost of capital. The second is that this acquisition 11 \nunequivocally demonstrates that MP’s current authorized ROE far exceeds its COE, in 12 \nviolation of Hope  and Minnesota’s regulatory compact.  13 \nQ. How does your argument that the transaction is a per se violation of Hope  relate to 14 \nMinnesota’s climate change policy goals?  15 \nA. No witness disputes that ALLETE shareholders will be walking away with a $1.5 -billion 16 \nprofit over rate base value if this transaction proceeds .106 As I have just demonstrated , unless 17 \nthe Commission reduces MP’s ROE  significantly  in other regulatory proceedings , this profit 18 \nwill ultimately come out of customers’ pockets. We should ask ourselves: What have 19 \nALLETE ’s current owners and managers done to deserve this windfall?  20 \n \n104 Notice of a Special Meeting of Shareholders  (Aug. 21, 2024) , ALLETE,  22-37, \nhttps://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/018522/20240701/NOMNP_581536.PDF .  \n105 GIP/CPP ’s investor return targets are  not a market -based cost of capital.  \n106 Ellis Direct at  21-24. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n42 The fundamental premise of the transaction is that, under its current public ownership, 1 \nALLETE will be unable to raise sufficient capital to meet Minnesota’s ambitious carbon - 2 \nreduction goals. Do ALLETE’s s hareholders deserve to be richly rewarded, at customer 3 \nexpense, simply because climate legislation was passed in Minnesota, spurring its need for 4 \nmore capital? Many states have set ambitious climate goals, and their utilities are managing 5 \nto rise to the challenge, financially, without resorting to private capital. Does ALLETE 6 \ndeserve to be rewarded simply for resorting to private capital? For what, exactly, should the 7 \nCommission wish to reward ALLETE’s current owners $1.5 billion?  8 \nQ. What should the Commission do with this information?  9 \nA. First, the transaction should be denied because the future excess profits that GIP/CPP assume 10 \nthey will recover from customers are clearly not in the public interest.  11 \nSecond, the Commission should recognize that its authorized ROEs have been inconsistent 12 \nwith Hope  and seek to correct that error going forward.  13 \nVI. GIP/CPP  WITNESS QUACKENBUSH  14 \nQ. What is the substance of Witness Quackenbush’s rebuttal of your testimony?  15 \nA. Witness Quackenbush’s rebuttal discusses my concerns about excessive ROEs and my 16 \ncompetitive direct equity (CDE) proposal. Like the other witnesses who discuss my 17 \ntestimony in their rebuttal, he attempts to dismiss them without ever addressing my 18 \narguments or the evidence and I analysis I introduce in their support. Witness Quackenbush 19 \nalso seeks to discredit my testimony by misrepresenting various statements in my testimony 20 \nand in the paper I introduced as CURE Schedule ME -2. 21 \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n43 A. Witness Quackenbush Provides No Substantive Rebuttal to the Fact That 1 \nAuthorized ROEs Exceed COE.  2 \nQ. What is Witness Quackenbush’s response to your claim that authorized ROEs have 3 \nbeen systematically higher than COE across the country for decades ? 4 \nA. Witness Quackenbush dismisses my claim without ever addressing the compelling evidence I 5 \nbring in support of it:  6 \nWitness Ellis is also postulating that all financial expert witnesses that appear on behalf 7 \nof utilities, Commission staffs, and Parties before all utility regulatory commissions 8 \nhave also done ROE wrong in every rate case for decades. This proposition is 9 \npreposterous and deserves no weight. Rather, it is Witness Ellis’ peculiar opinion that 10 \nis out -of-place.107 11 \nWhen asked in discovery to substantiate his assertion, specifically by addressing the key 12 \nevidence substantiating my arguments – utility market -to-book (M/B) ratios, Wall Street 13 \nreturn capital market assumptions (CMA) forecasts, and academic research – Witness 14 \nQuackenbush’s responses demonstrate a limited understanding of, even confusion about, the 15 \nissue.  16 \nQ.  How does Witness Quackenbush’s  limited understanding reveal itself  in testimony ? 17 \nA.  On whether M/B ratios  greater than 1.0 indicate ROEs exceed COE , he refers to Witness 18 \nBulkley’s explanations, which, as previously explained, prove the exact opposite of what she 19 \nargues . He nonetheless conced es that M/B ratios greater than 1.0  “represent a significant 20 \ndeviation from the cost of equity, which is a market -based forward -looking concept .”108 21 \nWitness Quackenbush  describes the CMAs as :  22 \nProjections by financial firms of stock market index price changes, which do not 23 \nresemble rigorous cost of equity estimates and represent an inadequate shortcut to reach 24 \n \n107 Quackenbush Rebuttal at  35. \n108 Schedule ME -12. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n44 conclusions about the market cost of equity. As such, such data provides no useful 1 \ninformation about the cost of equity.109  2 \nA cursory review of any of these reports would have revealed to him that CMAs  forecast 3 \ntotal expected returns , i.e., the cost of equity,110 and tha t they are based on rigorous 4 \nmethodologies .111 5 \nQ. How does Witness Quackenbush address academic research on this topic ? 6 \nA. Witness Quackenbush’s assessment of the academic literature is that the conclusions “would 7 \nbe driven by the cost of equity estimation model or models and inputs chosen by the 8 \nauthor ,”112 an obvious point that in no way refutes or otherwise calls into question the 9 \nresearch findings. T he methods, inputs, and conclusions of academic research are peer - 10 \nreviewed . Witness Quackenbush ’s critique appears to seek to discredit the entire enterprise of 11 \nacademic finance research  instead of engaging with the sub stance of my arguments.  12 \nAs the evidence provided in testimony and paper demonstrates, it is not just my “peculiar 13 \nopinion” that ROEs are too high; financial markets, all of Wall Street agree with this premise, 14 \nand academics agree as well.  15 \n \n109 MP R esponse to CURE IR  0025.

Witness Quackenbush Uses Strawman Arguments to Rebut My Testimony.  1 \nQ. How does Witness Quackenbush mis represent  your testimony ? 2 \nA. Witness Quackenbush makes assertions that have no basis in my testimony or the attached 3 \npaper. For example, he implies that I recommend that the Commission s tandardiz e and codify  4 \na specific “formula” for calculating ROE  and claims that doing so would be a “huge 5 \nmistake.”  6 \nStandardizing and codifying any ROE formula would be a mistake. Further,  7 \nstandardizing and codifying Witness Ellis’ [sic] ROE formula would be a huge 8 \nmistake .113 9 \nI mention only two formula s in my testimony , ROR=COC  and ROE=COE, formulas Witness 10 \nQuackenbush endorses himself in other writings . 11 \nWitness Quac kenbush  is the author of a NARUC report that su mmarizes the ROR=COC and 12 \nROE=COE standard s, stating : 13 \nFundamental financial concepts demonstrate that the fair rate of return to use in 14 \nratemaking for a utility is its cost of capital in order to achieve the proper balance 15 \nbetween customers and investors.114 16 \nand: 17 \nSetting the authorized base ROE equal to the cost of equity is integral to conventional 18 \ncost of service regulation. The cost of common equity is measured based on investors’ 19 \nrequired return on common equity. This equity fairness equation follows:  20 \nROE = k e 21 \nWhere ROE = return on equity; and ke = the cost of equity.115 22 \n \n113 Quackenbush Rebuttal at  35-36. \n114 John D.

In his rebuttal testimony, he is either contradicting his own 2 \nclearly stated stand ards in prior writings  or attributing to me something I did not say. 3 \n“Witness Ellis’ [sic] ROE formula” is the very same formula endorsed by Witness 4 \nQuackenbush.  5 \nQ. Are there other examples of Witness Quackenbush mischaracteriz ing your testimony ? 6 \nA. Yes. He accuses me of “surprising disregard for the authority of the Commission and these 7 \nprocesses.” When asked in discovery to specify which Commission authorities and processes 8 \nI disregard, Witness Quackenbush referred only to my choice  of words: “pocket -picking 9 \nlicenses,” “unearned windfalls,” and “pocket -picking monopolies .”116 This is a dispute over 10 \nstyle and not substance. Even if these are not the words Witness Quackenbush would  use, I 11 \nbelieve this terminology is based in fact, as I explain in my direct and in this rebuttal 12 \ntestimony.  13 \nWitness Quackenbush may not like my choice of terms; he’s entitled to this opinion. But 14 \nthere is nothing in those words that disregards the “authority of the Commission and these 15 \nprocesses.” To be clear, I make all of my recommendations expressly because I recognize the 16 \nconsiderable authority of the Commission, specifically its power to regulate rates and set 17 \nthem in a manner that balances the consumer and investor interests. If anything, the terms he 18 \nquibbles with reflect the substantial authority the Commission has over customers’ financ ial 19 \nand physical well -being . 20 \n \n116 MP Response  to CURE IR 0028 .

How does Witness Quack enbush mischaracterize the paper you submitted as CURE 1 \nSchedule ME -2? 2 \nA. Witness Quackenbush states, “In a recently published paper for the American Economic 3 \nLiberties Project, Witness Ellis appears to suggest that the Minnesota Public Utilities 4 \nCommission is engaging in corruption by setting rates according to nationally accepted 5 \nstandards that have been used for decades .”117 This statement misrepresents the content of 6 \nmy paper.  Here’s the full text of the passage to which Witness Quackenbush refers:  7 \nBribery, patronage, and fraud have plagued utility regulation from its inception and 8 \nremain  problems even today. While instances of prosecutable criminal behavior are 9 \nrelatively rare,  regulators are prone to a more subtle, yet ultimately more corrosive and 10 \nconsequential, form of  corruption: regulatory capture, “the result or process by which 11 \nregulation, in law or application, is  consistently or repeatedly directed away from the 12 \npublic interest and toward the interests of the  regulated industry.”  13 \nRegulatory law scholar and former FERC Administrative Law Judge Scott Hempling 14 \nposits that  capture is a product of regulators’ attitudes as much as utilities’ actions, 15 \nspecifically “a surplus  of passivity and reactivity, along with a deficit of curiosity and 16 \ncreativity” that result in “a body  of commission decisions, or non -decisions, about 17 \nresources, procedures, priorities and policies,  where what the utility wants has more 18 \ninfluence than what the public interest requires.”  Such attitudes are revealed in the 19 \nFlorida Public Service Commission’s squelching of the mere  questioning of utility 20 \nclaims about the need for high ROEs and the Wisconsin Public Service  Commission’s 21 \ndismissal of advocate concerns about excessive ROEs as distracting “eye candy”  and a 22 \n“headline grabber” and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s insistence that  23 \nutilities somehow are not part of the broader economy.118 24 \nMy critique of the Commission is for endorsing an economic assumption that was flawed on 25 \nits face. While not discussed in detail in the paper, the manner in which the Commission  did 26 \nso bears the hallmarks of Hempling’s description of capture: “ a surplus of passivity and 27 \nreactivity, along with a deficit of curiosity and creativity ,” result ing in “commission 28 \n \n117 Quackenbush Rebuttal at  34. \n118 Ellis Direct, Schedule  ME-2 at 14  (citations omitted ). \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n48 decisions, or non -decisions  … where what the utility wants has more influence than what the 1 \npublic interest requires.”   2 \nQ. Why did you use such strong language in your critique of regulators’  decision -making ? 3 \nA. I chose my words carefully and deliberately. As I explain at the outset, m y primar y concern  is 4 \na specific manifestation  of corruption : regulatory capture . Under both its academic119 and 5 \ncommon120 understandings, capture is understood to be  a form of corruption . 6 \nI wanted to draw attention to the problem of regulatory capture as a form of corruption, 7 \nbecause I believe it is a much more prevalent problem than corruption as commonly 8 \nunderstood (e.g., bribery, patronage, or fraud) and merits much more attention. I then 9 \nprovided several examples, one of which referred to th e Commission .121 10 \nQ. What is the subject of your specific critique of the Commission in your paper?  11 \nA. In the paper, I refer to a specific recommendation in the ALJ’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions 12 \nof Law and Recommendations from  Xcel/Northern States Power’s most recent rate case,122 13 \nwhich the Commission subsequently adopted  in its own Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 14 \nLaw, and Order.123 The ALJ’s recommendation is based on a finding that is, on its face, 15 \n \n119 See, e.g.,  William  J.

The Commission adopted the ALJ’s recommendation  without catching or 5 \nacknowledging the error , citing the flimsy evidence (although not the historical passage).  6 \nQ. Why is the ALJ’s and Commission’s finding unreasonable on its face?  7 \nA. No individual sector of the economy can grow faster than the economy overall forever. If it 8 \ndid, it would eventually be larger than the entire economy itself, i.e., the part would be larger 9 \nthan the whole. This is a mathematical fact, and finding the opposite defies basic logic.  10 \nQ. What was the specific recommendation of the ALJ, which was ultimately adopted by 11 \nthe Commission?  12 \nA. The ALJ recommended , and the Commission adopted,  sole reliance on a single model, a non - 13 \nstandard implementation of the discounted cash flow model  (DCF) , to calculate COE, and 14 \nthe rejection of the widely -used – throughout finance, not just for utilities – capital asset 15 \npricing model (CAPM).  16 \nThe ALJ recommended using a “two -stage DCF,”124 which the Commission adopted, albeit 17 \nunder a different name, the “two -growth DCF.”125 Although the name is similar to the multi - 18 \nstage DCF commonly used to estimate utility COE, it is functionally the same as the constant - 19 \n \n124 Office of Administrative Hearings,  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , 141-42, \neDockets Document No. 20233 -194394 -01.  \n125 Public Utilities Commission,  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , 89-90, \neDockets Document No. 20237 -197559 -01. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n50 growth  (or single -stage ) DCF, which lacks  any mechanism to cap long -term growth at a 1 \nreasonable level  if the short -term growth rate assumption is not economically sustainable . 2 \nC. Witness Quackenbush ’s Reference to the Critique of the Commission Has 3 \nImportant Implications for This Proceeding.  4 \nQ. How is Witness Quackenbush’s reference to your critique  of the Commission  relevant to 5 \nthis proceeding?  6 \nA. Witness Quackenbush’s mischaracterization of my paper is important for t wo reasons . First, 7 \nWitness Quackenbush’s attempt to discredit me merely because I critiqued the Commission’s 8 \nreasoning is unfounded. I believe any objective observer of the regulatory record  would reach 9 \nthe same conclusions I have.  10 \nMore importantly, t he result of the Commission’s decision – to rely on a single, non -standard 11 \nROE model that is prone to yield ing upwardly biased results – supports my argument in this 12 \nproceeding that the Commission’s authorized ROEs are excessive.  13 \n1. The Commission’ s preferred COE model is prone to producing 14 \nsystematically upwardly biased r esults.  15 \nQ. What is wrong with the  Commission’s  two-growth  DCF?  16 \nA. The two -growth DCF , as implemented according to the cited ALJ recommendation and 17 \nCommission order , typically implicitly assumes that the utility sector can grow faster than 18 \noverall GDP, forever , which is not possible.  19 \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n51 Q. Did any parties to the proceeding point this out to the ALJ and Commission?  1 \nA. Yes, both the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Division of Energy Resources  (the 2 \nDepartment )126 and the Minnesota Citizens Utility Board (CUB)127 submitted testimony to 3 \nthis effect , which was reviewed by the ALJ in the relevant docket.  4 \n2. The ALJ relied on flimsy evidence to support her recommendation.  5 \nQ. How did the ALJ justify her finding ? 6 \nA. The ALJ acknowledged that “ GDP is the sum of all private industry and government output 7 \nin the United  States, and its growth is an average of the value of those components of the 8 \neconomy .”128 Nonetheless, she relied on historical data submitted by Xcel showing that, from 9 \n1947 through 2021, the utility sector’s contribution to GDP grew faster than GDP as a 10 \nwhole129 and concluded that “using a GDP growth forecast as a cap on utility growth 11 \nforecasts” is less reasonable than extrapolating stock analysts 3 -to-5-year growth rates, which 12 \ntend to be greater than forecast GDP growth, into perpetuity.130 The Commission also 13 \nultimately cited this evidence.131 14 \nThe ALJ also noted that “t he Department has rejected use of GDP forecasts in a Multi -Stage 15 \nDCF  model in the past because there was ‘no basis to believe that the growth in GDP would  16 \n \n126 Office of Administrative Hearings,  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , 135-36, \neDockets Document No. 20233 -194394 -01. \n127 Id. at 139.  \n128 Id. at 141. \n129 Xcel Energy, Rebuttal Testimony of Dylan W.

Why is the first justification the ALJ relied upon not a strong basis for her decision?  5 \nA. There are several reasons the ALJ and Commission should not have relied on Xcel’s historic 6 \nGDP growth data  evidence. First, the data are cherry -picked. Had Xcel calculated the growth 7 \nrate starting just five years later, from 1952, they would have reached the opposite conclusion 8 \n– utilities’ contribution to GDP grew more slowly than GDP as a whole.134 Indeed, Xcel’s 9 \ntime-series chart of utilities’ contribution to GDP shows that it peaked in the 1980s and has 10 \nbeen on a downward trend – i.e., it has been growing more slowly than GDP – ever since.135 11 \nSecond, the only thing these data reveal is that the utility sector accounted for a smaller share of 12 \nGDP in 1947 than in 2021. But a moment’s reflection suggests that’s entirely expected. In 13 \n1947, many US households (14%) still lacked electricity service,136 and most of the electrical 14 \ndevices now commonly in use had very low market penetration or didn’t even exist: TVs, air 15 \n \n132 Office of Administrative Hearings,  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , 141 \nn.993,  eDockets Document No. 20233 -194394 -01.  \n133 Id. at 135, 142.  \n134 Bureau of Economic Analysis; GDP by Industry,  https://www.bea.gov/itable/gdp -by-industry ; \nsee also , Historical GDP Data, available at \nhttps://apps.bea.gov/industry/iTables%20Static%20Files/AllTablesHist.zip , \nhttps://apps.bea.gov/industry/Release/XLS/GDPxInd/ValueAdded.xlsx . \n135 Xcel Energy, Rebuttal Testimony of Dylan W.

While it can be reasonable to extrapolate some historic growth rates 4 \ninto the long -term future (e.g., GDP per capita and, as will be demonstrated below, utility 5 \ndividend per share), this is rarely appropriate when projecting the relative shares of 6 \nconstituent parts of a whole, in which case, mathematically, no part can grow faster than the 7 \nwhole forever.   8 \nFourth, the stock analysts who provide the growth forecasts that the ALJ and Commission chose 9 \ninstead to rely on expressly said these forecasts are valid for only a finite period, typically 3 10 \nto 5 years.137 Even the analysts who created the figures Xcel presented would not recommend 11 \nextrapolating them into perpetuity. It is also well -known that analysts’ forecasts are upwardly 12 \nbiased, as the Department noted.138 13 \n \n137 See, e.g. , Xcel Energy, Rebuttal Testimony of Dylan W.

The ALJ misapplied the regulatory record in justifying her 1 \nrecommendation.  2 \nQ. Was the ALJ correct in her second justification, invoking the Department’s past 3 \nrejection of GDP growth forecasts in the two -stage DCF model?  4 \nA. No. Keep in mind, the Department and CUB’s argument in testimony regarding forecast GDP 5 \ngrowth is that it imposes a cap on long -term utility growth, not that utility growth will 6 \nnecessarily equal GDP growth.139 7 \nThe ALJ appears not to have considered the context of the Department’s past rejection of 8 \nGDP growth forecasts. In the cited 2006 proceeding, the utility, CenterPoint, argued in favor 9 \nof using GDP forecasts for the second stage growth rate to increase the estimated COE.140 10 \nCenterPoint had not submitted any evidence to justify using the higher value, GDP, and the 11 \nDepartment therefore maintained “ there was ‘no basis to believe that the growth in GDP 12 \nwould  be comparable ’ to the growth of regulated utilities .”141 Reviewing the procedural 13 \nrecord, the Department’s position in 2006 was substantially the same as it is today: long -term 14 \nutility growth cannot exceed GDP.142 15 \n \n139 Office of Administrative Hearings,  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , 135-36, \n139, eDockets Document No. 20233 -194394 -01.  \n140 Unlike in the Xcel proceeding, forecast GDP growth exceeded the average of analysts’ utility \nnear-term growth forecasts in 2006.

This is not, nor ever was, 4 \nthe Department’s position.  5 \nQ. In the Xcel docket discussed in your report, did the Commission reference the 2006 6 \nlanguage cited by the ALJ?  7 \nA. No, but the Commission adopted without modification, presumably after standard review, the 8 \nALJ’s recommended ROE methodology – exclusive use of the two -growth DCF and 9 \nrejection of the CAPM . The Commission also endors ed the ALJ’s rejection of the 10 \nDepartment’s GDP growth rate cap , specifically referencing Xcel’s historical GDP analysis in 11 \nsupport of its decision.143 This was the error described  in my paper . 12 \nQ. Could the Commission have spotted the ALJ’s error in misinterpreting the 13 \nDepartment’s 2006 position ? 14 \nA. It seems likely, yes. The ALJ’s faulty interpretation of the Department’s intent is clear from 15 \nthe 2006 order itself:  16 \nAn analysis based on CenterPoint's assumption about multi -stage growth supported a 17 \nreturn on equity of 10.0 percent to 10.6 percent. A second analysis assuming that the 18 \nindustry would grow at the rate of the GDP supported a return on equity of 10.4 percent 19 \nto 11.0 percent.144 20 \nSetting long -term growth to GDP would have unjustifiably increased the ROE in that 2006 21 \ncase. The Department opposed CenterPoint’s analysis because there was no reason to believe 22 \n \n143 Public Utilities Commission,  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , 88, eDockets \nDocument No. 20237 -197559 -01. \n144 Public Utilities Commission, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , eDocket s \nDocument  No. 3560745 .  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n56 utility growth could match GDP, much less exceed it. The Commission in 2021 failed to 1 \nnotice and correct the ALJ’s error.145 2 \n4. The ALJ’ s  and Commission’ s  decision -making bear s the hallmarks of 3 \nregulatory capture , the point made in my report . 4 \nQ. Why do you think the Commission’s decision -making in this particular instance – its 5 \nrecommended DCF implementation – is an example of regulatory capture?  6 \nA. For three reasons. First, Hempling’s “surplus of passivity and reactivity, along with a deficit 7 \nof curiosity and creativity ” aptly describes  the ALJ’s and Commission’s rejection of the 8 \nDepartment and CUB’s appeal to common sense  and accept ance of Xcel’s view that utilities 9 \ncan grow faster than GDP into perpetuity.  10 \nIndeed, the ALJ went beyond mere passivity. Xcel did not cite the 2006 order  to support its 11 \nown argument to disregard GDP as a cap on utility growth.146 The 2006 order citation 12 \nappears to have been the product of the ALJ’s independent research of Commission 13 \nprecedents. She proactively dug  up a 15 -year-old precedent and misinterpreted it to mean the 14 \nexact opposite of its intent in support of an erroneous conclusion. While it’s impossible to 15 \n \n145 DCF models used in utility regulatory proceedings typically forecast dividends per share \n(DPS). Since mid -1926 (nearly 100 years), utility sector average DPS growth has just kept \npace with inflation. Given this long -term historical stability, the most app ropriate assumption \nfor long -term growth in the DCF model is forecast inflation, not GDP. The difference in yields \nof long -term Treasury and Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities (TIPS) is commonly used to \nprovide a market -based inflation forecast. M. El lis analysis of French Data Library and US \nBureau of Labor Statistics data , available at \nhttps://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html  and \nhttps://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm ; See also  Will Kenton, TIPS Spread: What it is, How it \nWorks, Relevance  (Apr. 12, 2023) , https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips -spread.asp ; \nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 30 -year Breakeven Inflation Rate,  \nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T30YIEM .  \n146 The order does not appear in the Xcel ROE expert’s direct or rebuttal testimony.  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n57 know the ALJ’s motivation for doing so, it certainly appears that “ what the utility wants [had] 1 \nmore influence ” on her judgment  “than what the public interest requires .” 2 \nSecond, the ALJ recommended,147 and the Commission endorsed,148 relying exclusively on 3 \nthe two -growth DCF to estimate COE, rejecting the CAPM. Despite its limitations, the 4 \nCAPM has a sound theoretical basis and remains the most commonly used method to 5 \nestimate COE throughout finance.149 6 \nThe third reason isn’t based on the procedural record, just observation. The Commission’s 7 \npreferred two -growth DCF has no support in the academic literature or any finance textbook 8 \nI am aware of.150 I did not plumb  Minnesota’s regulatory history to find the source of the 9 \ntwo-growth method, but I have never encountered it before in my 30+ years of research and 10 \napplication of the cost of capital. Its procedural steps (trimming outlier analyst growth 11 \nrates)151 do nothing to address the model’s fundamental and irredeemable flaw of assuming 12 \nunrealistic long -term growth.  13 \n \n147 Public Utilities Commission,  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , 141-44, \neDockets Document No. 20237 -197559 -01. \n148 Id. at 89. \n149 See, e.g. , Koller et al.,  supra  note 106, at 44.  Criticism of the CAPM is mostly related to its \nweak predictive validity relative to short -term Treasury rates. Relative to returns on long -term \nbonds, which is the common application in utility regulatory proceedings, the CAPM is a \nrobust model of expected returns.

Witness Quackenbush ’s Attempt to Undermine My Credibility by Citing My 1 \nPaper  Is Unfounded . 2 \nQ. Beyond citing its strong language, d id Witness Quackenbush address any of the 3 \narguments made in your paper ? 4 \nA. When asked in discovery to address my specific critique of the Commission’s finding , 5 \nWitness Quackenbush asserted that the Commission’s reasoning was correct, referenced his 6 \nNARUC cost of capital report, which discusses a variety of commonly used COE models, 7 \nand described the multi -stage DCF model.152 None of his responses addresses my critique of 8 \ncommissions in general or the specific critique of the Commission in my paper.  9 \nQ. What does Witness Quackenbush say about the GDP -cap on long -term utility growth?  10 \nA. Witness Quackenbush states:  11 \nMr. Ellis’ statement … about some stocks growing faster than GDP into perpetuity is 12 \nnot useful to the Commission. By definition, certain stocks will grow faster than an 13 \naverage growth rate such as the GDP growth rate, while other stocks will grow slower 14 \nthan average. There is nothing alarming or even significant that some stocks are 15 \nexpected to grow faster than the GDP growth rate.153 16 \nQ.  How is this a misreading of your critique?  17 \nA.  In his counterargument, Witness Quackenbush omits the critical phrase: “into perpetuity.” 18 \nThis is an obvious strawman argument. I do not claim no stock can grow faster than GDP 19 \nover a finite period of time; rather, no stock or industry sector can do so forever.  20 \n \n152 MP Response to CURE IR 0029.

Does Witness Quackenbush’s NARUC report discuss the use of GDP growth forecasts 1 \nin estimating COE?  2 \nA. No. “GDP” does not appear in the document. Witness Quackenbush’s  NARUC report is in no 3 \nway responsive to my critique of an unreasonable assumption about perpetual above -average 4 \ngrowth.154 5 \nQ. Does Witness Quackenbush’s description of the multi -stage DCF address your critique 6 \nof the ALJ’s and Commission’s reasoning in the prior docket?  7 \nA. No. If anything, it supports it:  8 \nMoreover, if an analyst believes a particular stock’s growth rate tapers off over time, 9 \nthere are ways to model that, for instance with a multi -stage DCF model.155 10 \nAs explain ed above , the Commission’s  COE methodology extrapolates short -term growth 11 \nforecasts into perpetuity, explicitly assuming the utility sector’s average growth rate does not 12 \ntaper off over time. Thus, Witness Quackenbush’s  assurance that this can be controlled for 13 \nmakes any economic assumption omitting that control seem less justifiable.  14 \nVII. GIP/CPP  AND  COMPETITIVE DIRECT EQUITY  15 \nQ. Did any of the four witnesses address your competitive direct equity (CDE) proposal?  16 \nA. Only one, Witness Quackenbush.  17 \nQ. What did Witness Quackenbush say about CDE?  18 \nA. Witness Quackenbush dismissed it out of hand as “ complicated [and] unrealistic.”156 When 19 \nasked in discovery to elaborate on or substantiate his assessment , Witness Quackenbush ’s 20 \nresponse  assume s various details that I did not address or even mention  in my proposal , such 21 \n \n154 Quackenbush , supra  note 111.   \n155 Schedule ME-14.  \n156 Quackenbush Rebuttal at  36. \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n60 as how capital structure would be determine d, multi -year capital commitments , the 1 \nregulatory process , and the Commission’s legal authority .157 He also makes various 2 \nunsubstantiated assertions about the operation of capital markets .158 3 \nWitness Quackenbush’s responses in no way undermine the proposal  and its intent:  a 4 \nstraightforward description of an alternative approach for GIP/CPP or other private equity 5 \ninvestors to provide capital to  MP in a manner consistent with the public interest.  6 \nQ. How is your CDE proposal relevant to this proceeding , and why is Witness 7 \nQuackenbush’s rejection premature ? 8 \nA. The entire premise of this transaction is that ALLETE is unable to raise equity to fund MP’s 9 \ngrowth. As I explain in detail in my testimony, GIP/CPP are only willing to pay their offered 10 \n$1.5-billion premium to MP’s rate base equity value because MP’s ROE is greater than its 11 \nmarket -based COE.  As explained in my discussion of Witness Bram’s rebuttal above, 12 \nGIP/CPP did not deny or refute this conclusion, even when specifically asked to do so. They 13 \nimplicitly acknowledge that MP’s market -based COE  is lower than its ROE; in fact, a n 14 \nexcess  ROE is the only way the transaction can possibly pencil out, in terms of meeting their 15 \ninvestor return targets.  16 \nBut t his new model could work for these potential owners. GIP/CPP could offer revised 17 \nterms: purchase just MP at a lower acquisition premium – in principle , none – in exchange 18 \nfor a lower MP authorized ROE. GIP/CPP could still provide all future capital, which is their 19 \nstated intent, but the cost to MP customers would be substantially lower than under MP’s 20 \ncurrent ROE.  Alternatively, GIP/CPP could just provide all of MP’s incremental equity at a 21 \n \n157 MP response to CURE IR 0030.  Attached here as Schedule ME-15.  \n158 Id.  \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n61 lower ROE, with ALLETE retaining its current interest in MP. GIP/CPP’s interest would 1 \nincrease over time as they contribute more equity to rate base. Rather than acquiring all of 2 \nALLETE in a single transaction with a high premium, they could provide MP’s  capital needs 3 \nas they arise, consistent with Minnesota law and the company’s stated need for equity 4 \ninvestment.  5 \nTo do this , GIP/CPP would need to figure out the ROE that would enable them to meet their 6 \nreturn targets. Ideally , they would also revisit and adjust their traditional private equity buy - 7 \nbuild -bail model investment strategy , which, as I explain in my direct testimony, is ill -suited 8 \nto utilities.159 9 \nQ. How would your proposal  appeal to GIP/CPP or other private equity investors ? 10 \nA. Not all private equity investors have a traditional buy -build -bail strategy.160 In my direct 11 \ntestimony, I cited BlackRock chairman Larry Fink’s 2024 annual letter, in which he described 12 \n“BlackRock’s next transformation” and the central role GIP would play in it.161 Since then, 13 \nelements of this strategy have been made public. For example, in a recent article in 14 \nInfrastructure Investor , GIP’s chairman and CEO  expresses a new-found desire to  provide 15 \nthe “long -dated equity” and “perpetual capital”  prescribed by CDE,  and anticipat ing a change 16 \nin GIP’s strategy away from the traditional private equity, buy -build -bail investment model: 17 \n“Legacy BlackRock would’ve been in the room but not part of the deal. Legacy GIP might 18 \nnot even have been in the room.” Indeed, he sees this change in their investment model as a 19 \nkey competitive advantage: “For those of you who are competitors, I feel sorry as all the 20 \n \n159 Ellis Direct  at 40-42. \n \n \nPUC Docket No. IP-7093/PPL -24-198 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA      and E015/M -24-383 \nHAS BEEN EXCISED                   OAH Docket No. 22-2500 -38948  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n62 deals that are going to come to us, given BlackRock is either a shareholder or bondholder in 1 \nall companies. But we’ll try and leave some crumbs for the rest of you.”162 2 \nWhile I and my colleagues from the American Economic Liberties Project and the Private 3 \nEquity Stakeholder Project will rightly have concerns about that last point – BlackRock’s 4 \ninvestment “in all companies” – I view BlackRock’s intention to innovate in the provision of 5 \nlonger -term equity financing for infrastructure as offering a glimmer of hope.  6 \nCDE has the potential to open a  market that has been mostly closed  to private equity : 7 \ninvestor -owned utilities. GIP and CPP could be CDE pioneers – offering equity financing to 8 \nutilities like Minnesota Power with ambitious energy transition goals at dramatically lower 9 \ncost, to utility customers, than the traditional regulator -authorized ROE model, while 10 \nsimultaneously providing attractive risk -adjusted returns to their partners and investors.  11 \nVIII.  CONCLUSION  12 \nQ. Do you have any concluding comments?  13 \nA. The four witnesses who discuss my testimony in their rebuttal universally fail to address my 14 \nsubstantive arguments. Instead, they employed a variety of semantic games, rhetorical 15 \nsleights of hand, and irrelevant or incorrect evidence. Often they contradict themselves in 16 \norder to reach their conclusions. Nothing they sa y in their rebuttal changes or justifies the 17 \nbasic fact that the proposed transaction is transparently not in the public interest.  18 \nQ. Have all of your opinions expressed herein been provided to a reasonable degree of 19 \neconomic professional certainty and been informed by your education, training, 20 \nbackground, and experience?  21 \nA.

My business address is 1519 Whispering Woods Circle, Allentown, 4 \nPennsylvania, 18106.  5 \n 6 \nQ. Did you provide di rect testimony in this proceeding?  7 \nA. Yes.  8 \n 9 \nII. PURPOSE  A ND SCOPE  10 \nQ. What is the purpose of your sur rebuttal testimony?  11 \nA. The purpose of this testimony is to respond to certain statements in the r e buttal 12 \ntestimony of Witness Alley  on behalf of the  Canada Pension Plan Investments Board 13 \n(“CPP Investments”) , Witness Bram on behalf of Global Infrastructure Partners ( “GIP”), 14 \nALLETE Witness Anderson , and ALLETE Witness Lapson .  15 \n 16 \nQ.

Lastly, I will address  rebuttal  comments related to the 20 \nregulatory compact including transparency and compliance with the Commission’s 21 \naffiliated interest standards.   22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nVavro  Direct  / 2 III. GOVERNANCE  1 \nQ. Did any of the rebuttal testimony discuss the principal concerns expressed i n y our 2 \ndirect testimony regarding the intended governance of ALLETE and Minnesota Power?  3 \nA. R ebuttal testimony on this topic was offered by witnesses for CPP Investments and GIP 4 \n(together, the Partners). Taken together, the r ebuttal testimony of Witnesses Alley and 5 \nBram do provide limited additional information regarding governance . Unfortunately, 6 \nthis testimony often misconstrue s or dismisse s my overall concerns.   7 \n 8 \nQ. What new information was provided by ALLETE and the Partners regarding 9 \ngovernance?  10 \nA. The witnesses clarified that there will be a  total of thirteen directors on the new ALLETE 11 \nBoard . Two of the thirteen ALLETE directors will be independent as that term is defined 12 \nby the Partners, i.e., not employed by ALLETE or the Partners. The CEO of ALLETE will be 13 \na voting member and not count as one of the two independent directors from 14 \nMinnesota and Wisconsin.1 The witnesses confirmed that Alloy Parent will not have a 15 \nBoard, and that the Partners will have “veto only” consent rights over material actions  16 \nof the ALLETE Board .2  17 \n  Witn ess Bram  also responded to my testimony about governance concerns 18 \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS  . . .  19 \n 20 \n \n1 There appears to be some confusion between the Partners as to whether the CEO is independent. Witness Bram \ntestified there would be three independent directors including the CEO, but Witness Alley does not consider the \nCEO to be  independent. Ex. MP -__ at 34 -36 (Alley Rebuttal) and Ex. MP -__ at 41 (Bram Rebuttal).  As an employee \nof ALLETE, the CEO would not be considered independent under the Partners’ definition.  \n2 Ex. MP- __ at 34- 38 (Alley Rebuttal) ; Ex.

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS] . 3 \n4 \nQ. Do the Partners make any additional commitments to address the concerns of other 5 \nparties? 6 \nA. Yes, although their commitments m ostl y reiterate portions  of their direct testimony or 7 \nnow publicly disclose information  previously discussed only in HCTS documents  to the 8 \neffect that day-to-day operations will be handled by the Minnesota Power senior 9 \nmanagement ; that members of the Board will be selected by the Partners based on their 10 \nexperience in relevant industries ; and that each Partner will have the right to appoint 11 \none director for every ten percent ownership in ALLETE indirectly held through Alloy 12 \nParent.4 13 \n14 \nQ. Do these commitments and new information fully address the concerns raised in your 15 \ntestimony about the proposed governance structure? 16 \nA. No, unfortunately not. While it is helpful to know more about the size of the proposed 17 \nBoard, too few of the directors would be truly independent, meaning that most can 18 \nhave material relationships with the Partners. Important information about proposed 19 \ngovernance has still not been provided, and the Partners’ commitment to provide 20 \n3 Ex. MP- __ at 40 (Bram Rebuttal).  Witness Bram’s statements were acknowledged by Witness Alley, see Ex. MP -\n__at 34 (Alley Rebuttal).  \n4 Ex. MP- __ at 42 -43 (Alley Rebuttal).  Ex. MP- __ at 41 -44 (Bram Rebuttal).

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS] 2 \nis not helpful , enlightening, or enforceable. My two main concerns about the proposed 3 \ngovernance structure —that it should balance the interests of Minnesota Power, its 4 \nratepayers, and the Partners and that it should maintain management independence  5 \nfrom the Partners —are not remedied  at all.5 Also, t hat the Partners still do not have 6 \nfinal documents describing how ALLETE will be governed after the acquisition only 7 \ncontributes to  the uncertainty  and to our overall discomfort . 8 \n  9 \nQ. Please explain.   10 \nA. The main issue is that the Partners, through their consent rights and appointment rights, 11 \nwill totally control the Board and therefore Minnesota Power. If conflicts arise between 12 \nthe best interests of Minnesota Power and its ratepayers on the one hand and those of 13 \nthe Partners on the other, the utility perspective may not be sufficiently considered. 14 \nWhile we do not dispute that the interests of the Partners and Minnesota Power should 15 \ngenerally align, sometimes interests will diverge and result in c onflicts. Good 16 \ngovernance  means that s ystems are in place to address such eventualities.  As currently 17 \nproposed, the ALLETE Board would likely do what the Partners direct, particularly given 18 \nthe ultimate control the Partners would have through their veto consent rights over 19 \nmaterial actions.    20 \n \n5 Ex. DOC -__ at 24 -27 (Vavro Direct).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nVavro  Direct  / 5 Q. What are  t hese consent rights and how do they work?  1 \nA. Witness Alley d escribes the consent rights,6 but i t is not clear whether the Partners’ 2 \nconsent rights w ould be exercised by unanimous vote, by majority vote  (meaning that 3 \nGIP could veto a Board decision that CPP Investments did not) , or otherwise.  4 \nApparently, having the ability to appoint all but two directors is not sufficient to ensure 5 \ncomplete control —the Partners also require the ability to veto material Board decisions 6 \nafter the fact.   While we do not know precisely which decisions will be considered 7 \nmaterial, they include significant actions that potentially could affect the value of the 8 \nPartners’ economic investment such as budgets, acquisitions or dispositions exceeding 9 \ncertain thresholds, issuance of additional equity interests, assumption of additional 10 \ndebt, fundamental changes to the purpose of the business , and dissolution or 11 \nbankruptcy.7  12 \n 13 \nQ. Can you provide examples of where the interest of investors and a regulated utility 14 \nand its ratepayers might diverge?   15 \nA. Conflicts of interest could arise over proposed business relationships between the utility 16 \nand the Partners’ affiliates or appointed directors, over the proper priorities for 17 \nallocating capital dollars between non -regulated and regulated subsidiaries, or over 18 \nplacing an undue emphasis on near -term increases to utility earnings.  We know that 19 \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS  . . .  20 \n 21 \n \n6 Ex. MP- __at 38 (Alley Rebuttal).  \n7 Ex. MP- __at 38 (Alley Rebuttal).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nVavro  Direct  / 6  1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n8 . . . HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA 7 \nENDS] In this context, the lack of a provision to address such conflicts of interest is 8 \nparticularly troubling.  9 \n 10 \nQ. What arguments have been offered against further changes to their proposed 11 \ngovernance structure?  12 \nA. Witness Bram  state s that the  Partners’  proposed governance structure is consistent 13 \nwith other utilities , and he cites Xcel appointing the directors of Norther n States Power 14 \nas an example .9 He also express es concerns that changing the proposed structure would 15 \nhave a chilling effect on investments in public utilities.10   16 \n 17 \nQ. Are these arguments valid?  18 \nA. No. Xcel appointing directors to the boards of its utility subsidiaries is not at all 19 \nequivalent to complete control of the entire corporate entity. Xcel is not a private equity 20 \nfund, but rather a publicly traded company with significant public reporting 21 \n \n8 Ex.

Xcel’s own Board of Directors has corporate guidelines defining 1 \nmembership criteria, director orientation, continuing education, expectations , and 2 \nevaluations, as well as defined governance, nominating , and compensation committees. 3 \nIn stark contrast to the proposal here, Xcel requires the majority of Board membership 4 \nto be independent directors as defined by the Nasdaq Stock Market, which means they 5 \nwill have no direct or indirect material relationship with Xcel. Among other reasons for 6 \nthis structure, Xcel’s governance guidelines clearly state that the independent 7 \nrequirement is designed to maintain the Board’s independence from management.11 8 \n  I know of no evidence to support the opinion that changing the proposed 9 \ngovernance structure would have a chilling effect on investment in public utilities. That 10 \nclaim is belied by o ther take -private transactions in which the parties agreed to 11 \ngovernance conditions that protect the interests of the public utility and its ratepayers 12 \nwhile balancing the owner’s legitimate need to protect its investment.  13 \n 14 \nQ. What t ake-private transactions adopted governance conditions that are more 15 \nfavorable to the utility and its ratepayers?  16 \nA. When E l Paso Electric was acquired by Infrastructure Investment Fund (“IIF”) in 2020, 17 \nboth the parties’ stipulation and the Texas Commission ’s Order required that El Paso 18 \nElectric have ten directors —two from IIF, the El Paso CEO, and the remaining seven 19 \nindependent as defined by the NYSE. Of these seven independent directors, at least four 20 \nalso had to be disinterested.12 Clear Delegations of Authority echoing these provisions 21 \n \n11 https://corporate.my.xcelenergy.com/s/about/leadership -governance  \n12 Ex.

Both the 6 \nstipulation and the Order in that proceeding required governance provisions much like 7 \nthose in the El Paso Electric transaction.15  8 \n  Ne w Jersey and Texas regulators further protected the public utility and its 9 \nratepayers by imposing certain voting protocols for specified material events . For 10 \nexample, a majority of independent director votes is needed to place SJI in voluntary 11 \nbankruptcy , and the majority of both IIF directors and independent directors is needed 12 \nto approve certain budget variance s for El Paso Electric.16 Overall, the agreed -upon 13 \ngovernance provisions for El Paso Electric and SJI more adequately reflect the intent of 14 \nthe regulatory compact.   15 \n 16 \nQ. In this context, does the governance structure proposed by ALLETE and the Partners 17 \nadequately balance the interests of Minnesota Power, its ratepayers, the Partners, 18 \nand other stakeholders?  19 \nA. No, i t does not, for all of the reasons I discussed above.  20 \n \n13 Ex. DOC -___, SLV -S-1 (Texas Commission Docket No. 49849, El Paso Electric Stipulation, Attachment B).  \n14 Ex.

C ORPORATE SEPARATION AND RING -FENCING  1 \nQ. Did any of the rebuttal testimony discuss your d ir ect testimony concerning the 2 \ncorporate separat ion a nd ring -fencing provisions offered by ALLETE and the Partners?  3 \nA. Yes, the re buttal testimony of Witnesses Lapson and Anderson. In several instances my 4 \ndirect testimony was misstated or misinterpreted , so for the sake o f clarity, I will first 5 \nreiterate  the two principal conclusion s in my testimony on these issues . 6 \n  My fi rst conclusion p ertained to the corporate separat ion commitments  set forth 7 \nin the Petition and further discussed in the Lapson direct testimony . These measures 8 \nwere intended to generally hold ALLETE harmless from business and financial risk 9 \nexposure associated with Alloy Parent as well as its subsidiaries or affiliates (other than 10 \nthose of ALLETE). In my direct testimony, I stated that while the se commitments were 11 \ngenerally consistent with the types of measures proposed in other take -private 12 \ntransactions, they were not, in and of themselves, sufficient.  13 \n  My s econd conclusion pertained to a separate and distinct issue, the lack of 14 \nadequate ring -fencing protections between Minnesota Power and ALLETE’s non - 15 \nregulated businesses, a situation that has existed for some time.17  16 \n 17 \nQ. What d id Witness Lapson testify about your first conclusion regarding the ring -fencing 18 \nprovisions between ALLETE and Alloy Parent? 19 \nA. Witness Lapson states that I h ad found the proposed ring -fencing provision s ineffective 20 \nbecause  they do not protect Minnesota Power against risks stemming from ALLETE’s 21 \n \n17 Ex. DOC -__ at 20  (Vavro Direct ). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nVavro  Direct  / 10 non-regulated businesses.18 This is a misstatement of my testimony. To be clear, my 1 \nassessment was based on the inadequacy of the measures to protect ALLETE f rom the 2 \nbusiness and financial risks of Alloy Parent and the Partners.  The absence of proper ring - 3 \nfencing around Minnesota Power itself is a separate  and distinct  issue.  4 \n  In  my d irect testimony, I  referred to a legal non-consolidation opinion as an 5 \nexample of how to improve the proposed Alloy Parent -ALLETE ring-fencing provisions.19  6 \nWitness Lapson challenged the necessity of such a  legal opinion.20 Other state 7 \ncommissions have disagreed.  In other recent take -private transactions , namely the 8 \nacquisition s of El Paso Electric and South Jersey  Industries by IIF , the acquirer 9 \ncommitted to seek ing a non -consolidation opinion as a means of strengthening 10 \nbankruptcy protections.21  11 \n 12 \nQ. Have ALLETE and the Partners offered any further ring -f encing protections in their 13 \nrebuttal testimony?  14 \nA. Witness Anderson o ffered two additional proposals, specifically : (1) Alloy Parent will not 15 \nuse utility assets to guarantee All oy Parent debt, and (2) Minnesota Power will be 16 \nprohibited from loaning funds to or borrowing funds from Alloy Parent or other 17 \nupstream entities.22  18 \n \n18 Ex.

Do these new conditions change your opinion about the overall sufficiency of the 1 \nAlloy Parent corporate separation or ring -fencing protections?  2 \nA. No. While they are a step in the right direction, my overall conclusion about the 3 \nsufficiency of their ring -fencing protections has not changed.  Bankruptcy protection, for 4 \nexample, could be further strengthened through a legal non-cons olidation opinion.  5 \n 6 \nQ. Moving on, did any of the rebuttal testimony  di scuss your second conclusion, the lack 7 \nof adequate ring -fencing protections between Minnesota Power and ALL ETE’s non - 8 \nregulated subsidiaries ?  9 \nA. Yes, th e rebuttal testimony of Witnesses Lapson and Anderson  addressed this issue .  10 \nWitness Lapson agree d with me that the issue of a lack of ring -fencing protections 11 \naround Minnesota Power has existed for a number of years. She also acknowledged that 12 \nthe ring-fencing measures proposed by ALLETE and the Partners were not intended to 13 \naddress those risks.23 She challenges, however, my statement that significant 14 \ninvestments by the Partners in ALLETE’s non- regulated businesses could further magnify 15 \nthese  risks, characterizing this  as highly unlikely.24 While we can not predict the future  16 \nwith certainty , I think it is reasonable to  assume th at over time the Partners could m ake 17 \nmeaningful investments in ALLETE’s non -regulated subsidiary businesses. For example, 18 \nin his direct testimony Witness Bra m talked of growth opportunities associated with 19 \nALLETE ’s attractive renewables platforms .25 In his rebuttal  testimony, he discussed  20 \n \n23 Ex.

Does W itness Anderson question the potential impact of the lack of adequate ring - 6 \nfencing protections for Minnesota Power ?  7 \nA. Yes. Witness Anderson downplays the importance of the evidence that ratepayers may 8 \nhave already been harmed by lack of proper ring -fencing . I discussed this in a HCTS  9 \nportion of my testimony.27 He claims that Minnesota Power assets are not used to 10 \nsecure any ALLETE debt used by subsidiaries.28 Even if true, that alone does not offer 11 \nsufficient bankruptcy protections to Minnesota Power  and does not constitute adequate 12 \nring-fencing protection overall. 13 \n 14 \nQ. What  el se has Witness Anderson stated regarding your testimony on this subject?  15 \nA. Witness Anderson mis characterizes my testimony about the lack of adequate protection 16 \nfor Minnesota Power , claiming that my conclusion was based on the mere fact that 17 \nALLETE has not yet adopted a holding company structure. He also claims I criticized the 18 \nCommission for a failure in its ongoing regulatory oversight.29 Neither statement is 19 \ncorrect. What I in fact state d in my  direct testimony was that developing effective ring - 20 \n \n26 Ex. MP- __ at 54 -55 (Bram Rebuttal).  \n27 Ex. DOC -__ at 21 (Vavro Direct); Ex.

What  merits stressing here is that formation of a holding company  has been a 4 \ntopic of discussion between Minnesota Power and the Commission for at least fifteen 5 \nyears.31 6 \n 7 \nQ. Please elaborate.   8 \nA. In 2009, Minesota Power submitted, at the Commission’s request, a formal analysis of  9 \nstructural separation . The company’s non- utility investments were still relatively modest  10 \nat that time . The report discussed the pros and cons of a holding company structure , 11 \nindicating that this form was beneficial because (1) the utility subsidiary, and therefore 12 \nratepayers, gain protection from the risks of other utility and non -utility operations, and 13 \n(2) debt used to finance non-utility activities would not generally become an obligation 14 \nof the utility subsidiary.32 Even at that time, Minnesota Power clearly recognized the 15 \npotential implications of the lack of ring -fencing within ALLETE.  16 \n  By t he time of the  2016 rate case, ALLETE ’s circumstances had changed as its 17 \nnon-regulated and other utility businesses had become more significant. In its 2023 18 \nConsolidated Capital Structure Petition, the company noted that, subject to internal 19 \napprovals, Minnesota Power was planning on submitting a holding company 20 \n \n30 Ex.

THE REGULATORY COMPACT , TRANS PARENCY, AND AFFILIATED INTEREST STANDARD  4 \nQ. Please recap the conclusions in your direct testimony about the approach to the 5 \naffiliated interest standard proposed by ALLETE and the Partners.  6 \nA. In my d ir ect testimony, I stated that ALLETE should comply with the affiliated interest 7 \nstandards and accompany ing regulations rather than using the “flexible view of 8 \naffiliated interest requirements” proffered by Witness Anderson in his direct 9 \ntestimony.34 The latter approach left open the possibility of conflicts of interest and an 10 \nopportunity for owners to benefit from preferential treatment in contracts and 11 \nprocurement s involving affiliates of GIP, CPP  Investments , or BlackRock .35 12 \n 13 \nQ. What rebuttal testimony was offered in response?  14 \nA. The position of ALLETE and the Partners has not really changed. Witnesses Alley and 15 \nBram indicated that affiliated interest issues can be administratively difficult to deal 16 \nwith , and proposed what they refer to as a “flexible approach ” which they claim is  17 \nconsistent with the Commission’s historic treatment.36  I am unaware of any 18 \nCommission decision that adopts this supposed “historic” approach. Witness Anderson 19 \nwas critical of us for not exploring the effectiveness of Minnesota Power’s existing 20 \n \n33 See Docket No. E015/S -23-29, 2023 Capital Structure Petition at 1 n. 1 (Feb. 17, 2023).  \n34 Ex.

Have ALLETE and the Partners offered any additional protections regarding affiliated 4 \ninterests?  5 \nA. Yes. AL LETE and the Partners offered to provide additional information that they believe 6 \nwill help mitigate concerns about the possibility for self -dealing. More specifically, 7 \nMinnesota Power would require all suppliers and any industrial customers with 8 \ncontracted rates to identify annually whether they are more than five percent owned by 9 \nCPP Investments , GIP , or BlackRock, and then report those entities on its Annual 10 \nAffiliated Interest Report. M innesota Power would also identify all contracts over $1 11 \nmillion with any of those suppliers or customers and notify the Commission within thirty  12 \ndays of execution, attesting that the contract was negotiated at arm’s length.38 13 \n 14 \nQ. What is the Department’s reaction to this proposal?  15 \nA. While these steps may help with transparency and are a step in the right direction, they 16 \nfall short of compliance with the statute.   17 \n \n37 Ex. MP- __ at 16 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n38 Ex. MP- __ at 17 -18 (Anderson Rebuttal); Ex. MP -__ at 41 -42 (Alley Rebuttal).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nVavro  Direct  / 16 Q. W itness Anderson argues that your position suggests that the Commission has been 1 \nmanaging the affiliated  interest statute incorrectly. Is that accurate?  2 \nA. Not at all. Rather, the proposed acquisition underscores the importance of compliance 3 \nwith the statute.  4 \n 5 \nQ. H ow so?   6 \nA. If the ALLETE acquisition moves forward, Minnesota Power will be the only utility in the 7 \nstate that is 100% owned by private equity. The situation in which a regulated utility will 8 \nbe owned by only two entities —60% by one and 40% by another —is quite unique. If 9 \nMinnesota Power does not track its affiliates and submit its affiliated transactions as 10 \nrequired, the work of the Commission and the Department to ensure that ratepayers 11 \nare being protected from self -dealing becomes extremely difficult if not impossible. To 12 \nbe sure, some transactions with affiliates can benefit ratepayers, but some may not. 13 \nRegulators should know about these transactions, so they can be more closely reviewed 14 \nin a timely fashion, and that is what the statute is designed to do.  15 \n 16 \nQ. Witness Lapson suggests that any risk of interference in the business affairs of ALLETE 17 \nby its new owners is no more problematic than that of other regulated utilities.39 Do 18 \nyou agree?  19 \nA. They are not the same. None of the utility holding companies mentioned by Witness 20 \nLapson have two private owners with business interests in hundreds of other companies 21 \n \n39  Ex. MP- __ at 4 (Lapson Rebuttal).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nVavro  Direct  / 17 that may have conflicts with their utility. They are also publicly owned, which offers 1 \nadditional transparency.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Witnesses Anderson and Lapson suggest that the Commission and the Department 4 \nwill be overloaded with submissions if they comply with the statute. What is your 5 \nresponse?  6 \nA. To be clear, the initial administrative burden of tracking affiliated relationships and 7 \nmaintaining compliance lies with the utility, not with the Commission or the 8 \nDepartment. The Department’s role is to review and analyze. The Commission’s role is 9 \napprove  or deny  affiliated interest agreements brought to its attention. At this point, we 10 \ndo not know the number or type of affiliated interest agreements that may be filed. The 11 \nDepartment suggests that the Commission require compliance with the statute. If 12 \ncompliance is truly burdensome for ALLETE or regulators, it  can be addressed at a later 13 \ntime . 14 \n  Th e affiliated interested statute is in place as the mechanism for the Department 15 \nand Commission to accomplish the monitoring of affiliated interest agreements and to 16 \nprotect ratepayers from self -dealing by a public utility. I have seen no evidence that the 17 \nCommission will be unable to effectively monitor such conflicts of interest. Rather than 18 \nassist the Commission in its obligation to protect ratepayers,  the petitioners’ proposal 19 \nwould hamper the Commission’s ability to do so because Minnesota Power would not 20 \nbe filing all relevant agreements.   21 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nVavro  Direct  / 18 Q. P lease briefly restate your conclusions regarding transparency and the regulatory 1 \ncompact.  2 \nA. In my d ir ect testimony, I stated that ALLETE and the Partners had demonstrated 3 \ninsufficient regard for the regulatory compact, particularly as it pertained to 4 \ntransparency.40 Overall, their commitments to information access did not indicate much 5 \ntransparency beyond the ALLETE level.  6 \n 7 \nQ. What rebuttal testimony was offered in response.  8 \nA. Witnesses Alley and Bram reiterated their intention to provide access to books and 9 \nrecords of the entities up to and including the Alloy Parent that are related to 10 \nMinnesota Power’s operations under Commission jurisdiction, and to provide audited 11 \nfinancial statements for Alloy Parent.41 These are “affirmations” rather than formal 12 \ncommitments , and as such may not be enforceable  unless contained in a Commission 13 \norder and the Partners agree to submit to the Commission’s jurisdiction for purposes of 14 \nenforcing such an order .42  15 \n 16 \nQ. Are these sufficient?  17 \nA. Unfortunately, these affirmations do not represent a meaningful change in the Partners’ 18 \ninitial positions and fall short of providing adequate transparency. ALLETE and the 19 \nPartners need to commit to providing broad access to books, records, data, and 20 \ninformation from whichever entities are relevant to the Department’s and Commission’s 21 \n \n40 Ex.

Transaction:  \n1. In the Joint Report and Application filed in this docket, Joint Applicants seek \nCommission approval of a transaction through which, in accordance with the \nAgreement and Plan of Merger (\"Merger Agreement\") attached as Exhibit A to the \nJoint Report and Application, Sun Jupiter's wholly-owned subsidiary, Sun Merger \nSub Inc. (\"Merger Sub\"), will merge with and into EPE, with EPE continuing as the \nsurviving corporation (the \"Transaction\"). IIF US 2 will provide Sun Jupiter the \nequity necessary to complete the acquisition of EPE. As a result of the Transaction, \nEPE will become a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Jupiter and an indirect, \nwholly owned subsidiary of IIF US 2. Shares held by EPE's current public \nshareholders immediately before the Transaction's effective time will be cancelled \nand converted into the right to receive $68.25 in cash per share without interest, and \nshares of EPE's common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange \n(\"NYSE\"). The per-share purchase price of $68.25 in cash represents an enterprise \nvalue of approximately $4.3 billion, including EPE's net debt, and is a 17% premium \nto EPE's unaffected closing price on May 31, 2019, the last trading day before the \nannouncement of the Merger Agreement. Immediately following the Transaction, \nSun Jupiter will own all the equity in EPE. \n2.

The \nSignatories specifically agree that the Transaction will not (a) result in the transfer of \njobs to workers outside of Texas, (b) adversely affect the health or safety of EPE's \ncustomers or employees, or (c) result in a decline in service. The Signatories also \nagree that the Transaction will result in no EPE property or other assets being sold, \ntransferred, or otherwise affected. \nB.

The stipulation \ncontains numerous regulatory commitments by the applicants. For the reasons discussed in this \nOrder, the Commission finds that the transaction is in the public interest under PURA §§ 14.101, \n39.262, and 39.915, provided that all the regulatory commitments described in this Order are met. \nA stipulation signed by the applicants, Commission Staff, Office of Public Utility Counsel \n(OPUC); City of El Paso (CEP); Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (TIEC); Freeport-McMoRan, \nInc. (Freeport-McMoRan); International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 960 (IBEW \n960); Vinton Steel, LLC (Vinton Steel); and United States Department of Defense & all other \nFederal Executive Agencies (DoD/FEA) (collectively, the signatories) was filed on December 18, \n2019. \nI. Discussion \nA. The Proposed Transaction \nIn the joint report and application filed in this docket, the applicants seek Commission \napproval of a transaction through which, in accordance with the June 1, 2019 Agreement and Plan \n' Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX.

(Merger Sub), will merge with and into \nEPE,-with EPE continuing as the surviving corporation (the transaction). IIF US 2 will provide \nSun Jupiter the equity necessary to complete the acquisition of EPE. As a result of the transaction, \nEPE will become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Jupiter and an indirect wholly owned \nsubsidiary of IIF US 2.

The per-share purchase price of $68.25 in cash represents an enterprise \nvalue of approximately $4.3 billion, including EPE's net debt, and is a 17% premium to EPE's \nunaffected closing price on May 31, 2019, the last trading day before the announcement of the \nmerger agreement. Immediately following the transaction, Sun Jupiter will own all the equity in \nEPE. \nB.

No Pledging of Utility Assets/Stock . Neither Boardwalk nor any other affiliate of IIF, \nexcluding ETG and SJIU, will pledge ETG’s assets, revenues, or shares.   Neither \nBoardwalk  nor any other  affiliate  of IIF, excluding  SJG and SJIU,  will pledge  SJG’s  \nassets, revenues,  or shares.

This information will be reflected in a tracking \nspreadsheet to identify the quantum of debt that will be subject to this provision \nand create the baseline for comparison to the Refinanced Debt terms.  Appendix \n1 of the Stipulation is an illustrative tracking spreadsheet that SJI will maintain and \nprovide in each base rate case for so long as this provision is in force.  On January \n15th of each calendar year after the closing of the Transaction, ETG and SJG will \nprovide  annual reports to BPU Staff and Rate Counsel containing the terms of all \nRefinanced Debt outstanding as of December 31st of the preceding calendar year \nincluding interest rate, maturity date, and future principal balance and interest \nexpense.  \n \n(ii) Commen cing with the first ETG and SJG base rate cases following the \nclosing of the Transaction, ETG or SJG, as applicable, will identify the total annual \ninterest expense for the Refinanced Debt for the test year period (referred to as \nthe “Refinanced Debt Inter est Expense”).  The Refinanced Debt Interest Expense \nwill be input into the tracking spreadsheet for comparison to the CIC Debt Interest \nExpense for the test year period.  In the event the Refinanced Debt Interest \nExpense is greater than the CIC Debt Inter est Expense, then a CIC Rate Credit \nwill be calculated using the following formula:   \n \nCIC Rate Credit = Refinanced Debt Interest Expense (Test YearX)  – CIC Debt \nInterest Expense (Test YearX)   \n \nAny positive amount from the above formula for SJG and/or ETG respectively will \nbe refunded to customers of the respective utility through an adjustment to \ncustomer rates (referred to as the “CIC Rate Credit Adjustment”).  \n \nIt is the intention of the Parties that the base rates for ETG and SJG will reflect the \nactual cost and balance of the Refinanced Debt for the test year.  To the extent \nthat the actual cost and balance of any Refinanced Debt is not included in base \nrates, then the CIC Rate Credit will be adjusted to exclude any such disallowed \ndebt and the associate d costs.  \n \n(iii) All Parties acknowledge the Petitioners are not obligated to issue \nRefinanced Debt with like tenors to the CIC Debt and may manage the refinancing \nof the CIC Debt to the best of their ability to mitigate interest rate exposure and \nexpense.  \n \n \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx.

The Parties further acknowledge that ETG \nand SJG will retain all applicable tax benefits associated with incremental \nRefinanced Debt Interest Expense relative to the CIC Debt Interest Expense.  \n \n36.

SJG shall pay dividends only if its senior \nunsecured debt is rated investment grade (i.e., at or above BBB - by Standard and \nPoor’s or Fitch or Baa3 by Moody’ s) at the time of such dividend payment by any \nNRSRO engaged on behalf, and at the sole discretion, of SJG.   For the avoidance \nof doubt, dividend payments will not be precluded by a below investment grade \nrating rendered by an NRSRO that has not been engag ed on behalf of SJG.  \n \n41. Dividends from ETG, SJG, and SJIU will be limited to no more than 100 percent of \nnet income.  \n \n42. ETG, SJG, and SJIU will maintain an equity ratio of at least 48 percent.  If the \nBoard should authorize a hypothetical capital structure tha t contains a common \nequity ratio of less than 48 percent, then SJG and ETG may maintain such lower \nratemaking equity ratio until a different equity ratio is authorized.  \n \n43.

In addition, customers will be held harmless \nfrom any increased cost of debt result ing from the change in control through a cost of \ndebt tracking mechanism and rate c redit for any increase in the cost of debt directly \nresulting f rom or through the merger.  \n \n Employees :  The Stipulation provides that there will be no involuntary workforce \nreductions, or decrease in wages, benefits or terms and conditions of employment , for five \n(5) years following the closing , except for positions that become obsolete due to the \nMerger.  For five (5) years, ETG and SJG will submit annual reports to the Board detailing \nthe number of employees by position and function, and a description of the t raining and \nreassignment for any employees whose position s the Company deems obsolete or no \nlonger required.  SJI will maintain local cor e management teams for five (5) years following \nthe closing .  SJI will honor all collective bargaining agreements, and existing ETG and \nSJG pension benefits , so long as IIF ret ains ownership of SJI.  \n \n Provision of Safe and Adequate Service :  The Parties agree, pursuant to the Stipulation, \nthat ETG and SJG will continue to provide safe, adequate and reliable service , and fulfill \nall of its obligations under New Jersey law, subject  to the continued jurisdiction of the \nBoard.  SJI, ETG and SJG will maintain their headquarters in New Jersey for so long as \nBoardwalk owns SJI.  Additionally, ETG and SJG will maintain their existing call centers, \nfield service centers and walk -in payment  centers for at least three (3) years post -\nClosing.13  SJI will provide ETG and SJG with the resources necessary to invest in capital \nand infrastructure projects to help ensure that ETG and SJG will continue to provide safe , \nadequate  and proper utility service.  \n \n Charitable and Community Support :  Boardwalk and SJI commit that ETG and SJG each \nwill provide at least $500,000 annually for five (5) years post -merger. Projects may \ninclude charitable, educational, community support and economic development efforts. \nBoardwalk also will co mmit to make, or cause to make,  annual contributions of at least \n$500,000 to NJ SHARES for at least five (5) years post -merger.

The \n$75 million dollars provided to eli minate COVID -19 arrearages and to fund a direct rate credit , \ntogether with the employment commitments that extend five (5) years from the closing of the \nMerger , constitute a net positive benefit for ETG ’s and SJG ’s ratepayers  and for New Jersey  as \na whole .  Ratepayers will receive approximately $60 million via a bill credit, which is a benefit \nthat would not occur but for  the Merger.  SJI agreed to maintain employment at levels specified \nin the Stipulation and committed to maintain core management to ensur e continued maintenance \nof safe, adequate and proper service.  Further, the Stipulation contains various ring fencing and \nother measures including the establishment of a commercial paper program to ensure the \ncontinuing financial integrity of the utility.    \n \nFinally, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 48:3 -7 and N.J.S.A. 48:3 -10, the Board must determine whether \nthe public utility or a wholly owned subsidiary thereof, is able to fulfill its pension obligations to \nany of its employees.

DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 32 of 91\n2 \n  The parties to this proceeding are as follows:   IIF US Holding 2 LP (IIF), NJ Boardwalk \nHoldings LLC (Boardwalk), and Boardwalk Merger  Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), together with South \nJersey Industries, Inc. (SJI),  SJI Utilities, Inc. (SJIU),  Elizabethtown Gas Company (ETG) and \nSouth Jersey Gas Company (SJG) , (collectively, the “Joint Petitioners”); the New Jersey Division \nof Rate Counsel (Rate Counsel); th e Staff of the New Jersey Board of  Public Utilities (Board Staff  \nor Staff); and Intervenors, New Jersey La rge Energy Users Coalition (NJLEUC) and the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund (EDF),  and Participants, Public Service Electric and Gas Company \n(PSE&G), Atlantic City Electric Company (A CE), and the New Jersey Laborers-Employers \nCooperation and Education Trust (NJLECET). \n The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities sha ll be referred to in this Stipulation of \nSettlement (Stipulation) as th e “Board” or the “BPU.”   \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n On April 25, 2022, the Joint Petitioners initia ted this proceeding with the filing of a \nCertified Joint Petition (Joint Petition) with the Board seeking approval pursuant to N.J.S.A. 48:2-\n51.1 and N.J.A.C. 14:1-5.14(c), of an indirect change of control of ETG and SJG to be effectuated \nby the merger of SJI and Merger Sub (a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk), with SJI the \nsurviving entity (the Transaction).  \nBy Order dated June 8, 2022, the Board reta ined this matter for hearing, designated \nCommissioner Mary-Anna Holden as the presiding officer, and required that motions to intervene \nor participate be filed by July 8, 2022.  Moti ons to Intervene were timely filed by NJLEUC on \nJune 28, 2022, and by NJLECET on July 8, 2022.  Motions  to Participate were  timely filed by \nACE on July 7, 2022, and PSE&G on July 8, 2022.   \nOnly July 8, 2022, EDF filed a letter seeking a one week extension to further consider if it \nwould seek to intervene in this proceeding.  On July 14, 2022, Commissioner Holden denied EDF’s \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 33 of 91\n3 \n request.  On July 15, 2022, EDF filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a Motion to Intervene.  \nOn July 22, 2022, Joint Petitioners filed corresp ondence opposing the granting of EDF’s Motions, \nand a second letter indicating they did not oppose the granting of the Motions filed by NJLEUC, \nACE, PSE&G and NJLECET, respectively.  Also on July 22, 2022, Rate Counsel filed a letter indicating it did not object to the granting of the Motions fi led by NJLEUC, ACE, PSE&G, or \nEDF but objecting to Intervenor  status for NJLECET and ar guing Participant status was \nappropriate.  On August 10. 2022, Commissioner Hold en issued an Order granting Intervenor \nstatus to NJLEUC and EDF, and Participant status to ACE, PSE&G and NJLECET. \nA Pre-Hearing Conference with Commissioner Holden was held virtually on August 12, \n2022, and a Pre-Hearing Order settin g a procedural schedule for this matter was issued on August \n17, 2022.   \nAfter proper public notice, two  virtual  public comment hearings were held on September \n29, 2022 with sessions at 4:30 P.M. and 5:30 P.M.  One member of the public  appeared at the \npublic hearings and also provided a le tter in support of the Transaction. \nOn October 18, 2022, Joint Petitioners filed a request with Commissioner Holden to extend \nthe procedural schedule by approximately three w eeks (the Modified Procedural Schedule) to \npermit the parties to continue settlement discussions .  In addition to Joint Petitioners, Board Staff, \nRate Counsel and NJLEUC indicated they did not  object to the proposed Modified Procedural \nSchedule.  On October 19, 2022, ED F filed a letter indi cating it opposed the re quested extension.  \nOn October 20, 2022, Joint Petitioners filed correspondence responding to EDF’s opposition and \nurging that the extension request be granted.  On October 24, 2022, Commissioner Holden issued \nan Order adopting the proposed Mo dified Procedural Schedule. \nOn November 9, 2022, the Joint Petitioners sought  a further extension of the procedural \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 34 of 91\n4 \n schedule, which Commissioner Holden granted.  Commissioner Holden issued a Second Modified \nProcedural Schedule on November 29, 2022. \nPursuant to the Second Modified Procedural  Schedule, Direct Testimony was filed on \nDecember 2, 2022 by the following individuals on be half of Rate Counsel:  Andrea Crane, Susan \nBaldwin, Maximilian Chang, and John Rosenkran z.  Also on December 2, 2022, EDF filed the \nDirect Testimony of the following individuals: Davi d Hill and Tianyi Sun.  No other parties filed \nDirect Testimony. \n The Joint Petition was supported by the Direct  Testimony of four witnesses: Michael J. \nRenna and Melissa Orsen on behalf of SJI, SJIU, ETG and SJG; a nd Andrew E. Gilbert and Ellen \nLapson (of Lapson Advisory) on behalf of IIF, Boardwalk and Merger Sub.  For the purpose of providing the Board with a record  supporting the Stipulation, the Si gnatory Parties stipulate into \nthe record these Direct Testimonies, supporting do cuments and all of the discovery and informal \nresponses provided during the course of this proceeding.  \nExtensive discovery was conducted and a number of settlement discussions were held.  \nJoint Petitioners, Board Staff, Rate Counsel, NJLEUC and EDF  (collectively, the “Signatory \nParties”) have come to an agreem ent on all of the factual and legal issues arising in this matter.   \nSTIPULATED MATTERS \n \n Based upon the foregoing, the Signatory Partie s hereto agree and s tipulate as follows: \nA. Standard of Review.  The statutory and regulatory criteria for approval of \npetitions involving acquisitions of control of  a New Jersey public utility, as set forth \nin N.J.S.A. 48:2-51.1 and N.J.A.C.  14:1-5.14(c) and any related statutes and \nregulations, have been satis fied.  More particularly, the agreement and conditions \nset forth herein support findings and conclusions by the Board that: (a) the \nTransaction will not have an adverse impact on competition, on the rates of affected \nratepayers, on the employees of ETG or SJG, or on the provision of safe and \nadequate utility service at just and reas onable rates; and (b) that consummation of \nthe Transaction, consistent with  the conditions set forth in this Stipulation, is in the \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 35 of 91\n5 \n public interest, and will result in positive benefits to customers and the State of New \nJersey.     In support of the foregoing findings, the Signatory Parties have made the following agreements:  B. Impact on Rates \n1. The Joint Petitioners will provide a financial benefit of $75 million to ETG and SJG customers distributed as follows:  i. Within 30 days of the completion of the Merger, SJG and ETG will collectively write-off 100 percent of the total COVID deferrals outstanding as of such date inclusive of all cost categories, including customer \narrearages.  These deferrals are curren tly estimated to to tal $6.1 million for \nSJG and $8.8 million for ETG as of November 30, 2022. The costs written-off will not be recovered from custom ers. Write-offs related to these \narrearages will be designated per spec ific individual customer accounts.  A \nlist of the customers who received an account credit as a re sult of the write-\noff will be provided to the parties within 30 days of completion of the Merger.    \n \nii. After the closing of the Merger, SJI will cause ETG and SJG to issue rate \ncredits  to all customers in an amoun t equal to the difference between $75 \nmillion and the amount of C OVID deferrals written off in accordance with \nSection 1.i. above (the “Credit Amount ”).  The Credit Amount will be split \ninto two annual installments and will be structured as credits against the customer’s monthly bills.   The first half of th e Credit Amount will be \nprovided within 90 days of the closing of  the Merger.  The final half of the \nCredit Amount  will be provided during the  month of the first anniversary \nof the payment of  the first half of the Credit Amount.  The rate credits will \nbe funded by shareholders, not customers, and will be issued on a per customer basis to customers of all rate classes. \n \n2. The parties agree that ETG and SJG will not file another base rate case for new rates effective prior to two (2) years from the effective date of the Board’s Orders \nin the 2022 rate cases for each Company. \n \n3. No recovery in rates will be sought for (i ) any acquisition premiu m associated with \nthe Merger or any previous acquisition/merger, (ii) any costs associated with goodwill arising from the Merger or any previous acquisition, or (iii) any \ntransaction costs incurred in connection with the Merger. For purposes of this \ncommitment, transaction costs are defined as (a) consultant, investment banker, \nlegal and regulatory support fees (interna l as well as external), and printing and \nsimilar expenses in each case paid to a dvance or consummate the Merger, and (b) \nseverance, retention or change-in-control payments made to employees of the Joint \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 36 of 91\n6 \n Petitioners related to the Merger.  Any su ch costs will be considered “transaction \ncosts”.  \n \n4. Neither ETG nor SJG will include any common equity associated with goodwill \n(including Merger-related goodwill on Boardwalk’s or SJI’s balance sheet or \ngoodwill arising from prior transactions) in  their ratemaking capital structures. \nGoodwill associated with the Transaction will  not be included in rates, rate base, \nany common equity balance reflected in the determination of allowance for funds \nused during construction (AFUDC), cost  of capital, operating expenses, or any \nother ratemaking component in future ETG or SJG proceedings. \n   \n5. Goodwill will not be included, directly or indirectly, in any allocation factor \ncalculation that is used to allocate costs, including joint and common costs, to ETG \nor SJG. \n \n6. No time and expenses, third party costs, f ees, expenses, or costs of the transition \n(collectively “transition cost s”) incurred by any party to  the transaction (including \nIIF and its subsidiaries and affiliates) wi ll be borne by the customers of ETG or \nSJG. Transition costs are those costs nece ssary to integrate SJ I, ETG, and/or SJG \ninto the holdings of IIF or its subsidiaries.  \n \n7. SJIU, ETG and SJG will not be allocated any costs from Boardwalk or any other \nsubsidiary or affiliate of IIF.  In addi tion, SJIU, ETG and SJG agree not to engage \nInfrastructure Investment Group (“IIG”) in any transaction in which the fees of IIG \nunder such arrangement would be charged, dire ctly or indirectly, to customers.  SJI \nmay allocate costs from Boardwalk or any other subsidiary or affiliate of IIF to \nETG, SJG or SJIU, subject to Board approva l of an acceptable affiliate services \nagreement.  \n \n8. For ratemaking purposes, the Board will reta in jurisdiction over all costs allocated \nto ETG or SJG by affiliates.  Neither ETG nor SJG will challenge the Board’s authority to determine the appropriate affiliate cost allocations reflected in New Jersey utility rates.   \n  \n9. Any savings realized by ETG and SJG by vi rtue of the Merger will be tracked \nbeginning with the merger closing until th e first rate case for each company.  \nSavings will be flowed through to utility cu stomers in a future base rate case, net \nof any costs to achieve such savings. \n \nC. Impact on Employees and Corporate Governance. \n \n10. For a period of five (5) years following the closing of the Merger, as a result of the Merger, SJI will not implement any involuntary workforce reductions or decreases to wages, benefits and other terms and condi tions of employment in effect prior to \nthe closing of the Merger.  This co mmitment shall not prohibit work force \nreductions for positions that are obsolete or no longer required.  The Company will \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 37 of 91\n7 \n make a good faith effort to  offer training and new assi gnments to employees and \nreassign them to other areas of the Company to avoid such reductions.   \n \n11. SJI will honor all of ETG’s and SJG’s existing collective bargaining agreements in \neffect at the time of th e closing of the Merger. \n \n12. SJI will ensure that ETG’s and SJG’s pension obligations to employees will be satisfied. \n \n13. SJI will maintain SJIU’s, ETG’s and SJ G’s respective local core management \nteams for a period of at least five (5) years following the closing of the Merger \nsubject to a Board order finding in  any other relevant proceeding. \n \n14. Each of SJI’s, ETG’s and SJG’s CEO and se nior management will continue to have \nday- to-day control over operations. \n15. SJI’s, ETG’s and SJG’s local management will remain the primary point of contact \nfor all regulatory, operational, and community engagement matters. \n \n16. SJI shall honor all ex isting ETG and SJG’s pension benefits so long as IIF retains \nownership of SJI, provided that this commi tment shall not preclude IIF or SJI from: \n(a) making future changes to SJG and ETG 's current defined benefit plan if \ncommercially advantageous (including, but  not limited to, cost effectiveness, \nadministrative efficiency, etc.) so long as pension benefits are materially \nequivalent, or (b) making future changes negot iated between SJG and ETG as part \nof their collective bargai ning agreement negotiations. \n \n17. For the period of five (5) years after consummation of the Merger, SJG and ETG \nwill continue to provide the Board with an updated employee count (by position and function, including exempt and non-exempt employees) in annual filings to the Board to facilitate the Board’s ability to  ensure that SJG and ETG maintains an \nadequate workforce to continue to provide safe and reliable service. \n \nD. Impact on Service. \n \n18. SJI, ETG and SJG will maintain their hea dquarters in New Jersey for so long as \nBoardwalk owns SJI. \n \n19. ETG and SJG will maintain their existing ca ll centers, field service centers, and \nwalk-in payment centers for at least thre e (3) years following the closing of the \nMerger, with the exception of SJG’s Pleasantville walk-in payment center, the closure of which was approved by Board Order, effective Ma rch 2, 2022, in BPU \nDocket No. GO21101159. \n \n20. Boardwalk and SJI will provide ETG and SJG with the resources necessary to \ninvest in capital and infrastructure projects to help to ensure that ETG and SJG will \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 38 of 91\n8 \n continue to provide safe, adequa te and proper ut ility service. \n \n21. SJI will end the license agr eement with HomeServe when it expires in 2026.  SJG \nwill not allow the license agreement to automatically renew.  SJI will provide \nnotification to HomeServe that it will not renew the license within 30 days of the \nclosing of the merger to ensure that HomeServe has sufficient time to stop using \nthe logo.   \n \n22. SJI will confirm that no unaffiliated compan ies, other than HomeServe, use the SJI \nlogo or any version of the SJ I logo and SJI will not allo w any new licenses of its \nlogo or any versions of its l ogo for unaffiliated companies. \n \nE. Charitable and Community Support. \n \n23. Boardwalk and SJI will commit that ETG  and SJG will provide community support \ncontributions of at least $500,000 annually each  for a period of at least five (5) years \nfollowing the closing of the Merger.  Community support projects may include \ncharitable, educational, community s upport and economic development efforts. \nThese amounts will be not recovered from customers.   \n24. Boardwalk will commit to make , or to cause to be made , an annual contribution in \nthe amount of $500,000 to NJ SHARES (not earmarked for ETG or  SJG customers) \nfor a period of at least five (5) years follo wing the closing of the Merger to assist \nNew Jersey’s low-income customers with payment of their utility bills. These amounts will not be recovered from cust omers.  ETG and SJG will otherwise \ncontinue their participation in government administered programs such as USF and \nComfort Partners and continue to re cover associated costs through rates. \n \nF. Impact on Competition. \n \n25. Boardwalk and SJI will comply with applic able New Jersey and federal affiliate \nrelations standards, including those relating to retail access and customer choice. SJG and ETG will refrain from granting any undue preference to any affiliate of IIF and comply with the affi liate standards in N.J.A.C.  14:4-3.5 when dealing with \nall affiliates of IIF as th is term is defined below under Ring-Fencing Commitments \nincluding entities that are not designate d as a “related competitive business \nsegment.” \n \n26. SJG and ETG will not contract for service from a new natural gas transportation or storage project owned by an affiliate, or any entity in which an affiliate has an \nownership interest, without pr ior approval from the Board. \n \n27. SJG and ETG will publicly post on a quarterly  basis detailed information required \nby BGSS Minimum Filing Requirement (“MFR”) number 13 for all affiliate gas supply transactions.  The information will be maintained on the website for a period of one year from the posting. \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 39 of 91\n9 \n  \n28. The Joint Petitioners agree to comply with FERC regulations and orders in effect \nfrom time to time to the extent applicable to IIF’s indirect ownership of SJG and/or ETG.  \n \nG. Continued Regulatory Compliance. \n \n29. Following the closing of the Merger, Boardwalk will ensure that SJI and ETG continue to comply with all applicable continuing obligations arising from prior \ntransactions, including the conditions imposed by the Board in connection with SJI’s acquisition of ETG in I/M/O the Acquisition of Eliz abethtown Gas, a Division \nof Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc. by ETG Acquisition Corp., a Subsidiary of South \nJersey Industries, Inc. and Related Transactions, BPU Docket No. GM17121309. \n \nH.

For so long as Boardwalk, SJIU, SJI, IIF US Holding 2 and/or any \nof their successors or assigns directly  or indirectly owns ETG and SJG: \n \n30. Holding Company Existence. Boardwalk will be retained in the ownership chain \nbetween SJI and IIF. Boardwalk Topco LLC, Boardwalk Parent LLC and Boardwalk will have no operational functi ons other than those related to holding \nthe equity interests in SJI.  \n \n31. Corporate Separateness. ETG and SJG will each maintain their separateness in \nterms of their respective existence, franchi ses, obligations and privileges, including \ntheir names and logos.  \n32.

DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 40 of 91\n10 \n IIF, excluding ETG and SJIU, will pledge  ETG’s assets, revenues, or shares. \nNeither Boardwalk nor any other affiliat e of IIF, excluding SJG and SJIU, will \npledge SJG’s assets, revenues, or shares. Neither Boardwalk nor any other affiliate \nof IIF, excluding SJG, ETG, and SJIU, will pledge SJIU’s assets, revenues, or \nshares. \n \n34. No Transaction Related Debt at ETG, SJG or SJIU. None of SJ IU, SJG or ETG will \nincur, guaranty, or pledge a ssets for any new incremental debt related to the Merger. \n \n35. Refinancings or Debt Replacements. ETG’s and SJG’s current rates reflect the cost \nof first mortgage bonds and senior not es that contain “c hange-in-control” \nprovisions that allow the bond and note invest ors to sell (put) their bonds and notes \nback to the respective issuer  at the face amount of the de bt in connection with the \nTransaction.  The Parties acknowledge that (a) to the extent ETG and/or SJG incurs increased interest expense as a result of  issuing new debt (referred to as the \n“Refinanced Debt”) solely to replace any first mortgage bonds and senior notes that \nare redeemed by ETG and/or SJG as a resu lt of an investor exercising a put in \nconnection with the Transaction (referred to as the “CIC Debt”) and (b) such \nincreased interest costs are included in the ba se rates set in future base rate cases, \nthen ETG and/or SJG, as applicable w ill provide customers with a rate credit \n(referred to as the “CIC Rate Credit”) in  future base rate cases for the remaining \ntenor of the CIC Debt on the following terms and conditions: \n  \n(i) Within 30 days of the expiration of the put window in connection with the \nTransaction, the Petitioners wi ll identify all tranches (or po rtions of tranches if less \nthan 100% of a tranche is redeemed) of ETG and SJG debt that were redeemed, \nincluding the interest rate, maturity date, and future principal balance and interest expense (referred to as the “CIC Debt In terest Expense”) by year for the remaining \ntenor of each such tranche.  This in formation will be reflected in a tracking \nspreadsheet to identify the quantum of de bt that will be subject to this provision \nand create the baseline for comparison to the Refinanced Debt terms.  Appendix 1 \nis an illustrative tracking spreadsheet that  SJI will maintain and provide in each \nbase rate case for so long as  this provision is in  force.  On January 15th of each \ncalendar year after the clos ing of the Transaction, ETG  and SJG will provide annual \nreports to BPU Staff and Rate Counsel cont aining the terms of all Refinanced Debt \noutstanding as of December 31st of the preceding calenda r year including interest \nrate, maturity date, and future prin cipal balance and interest expense. \n \n(ii) Commencing with the first ETG a nd SJG base rate cases following the \nclosing of the Transaction, ETG or SJG, as applicable, will identify the total annual \ninterest expense for the Refinanced Debt fo r the test year period (referred to as the \n“Refinanced Debt Interest Expense”).  The Refinanced Debt Interest Expense will be input into the tracking spreadsheet for comparison to the CIC Debt Interest \nExpense for the test year pe riod.  In the event the Refinanced Debt Interest Expense \nis greater than the CIC Debt Interest E xpense, then a CIC Rate Credit will be \ncalculated using the following formula:  \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 41 of 91\n11 \n  \nCIC Rate Credit = Refinan ced Debt Interest Expense (Test YearX)  – CIC Debt \nInterest Expense (Test YearX)   \nAny positive amount from the above formula for SJG and/or ETG respectively will \nbe refunded to customers of the respective utility through an adjustment to customer \nrates (referred to as the “CIC  Rate Credit Adjustment”). \nIt is the intention of the Parties that th e base rates for ETG and SJG will reflect the \nactual cost and balance of the Refinanced Debt  for the test year.  To the extent that \nthe actual cost and balance of any Refinan ced Debt is not included in base rates, \nthen the CIC Rate Credit will be adjusted to exclude any such disallowed debt and \nthe associated costs. \n (iii) All Parties acknowledge the Petitioners are not obligated to issue Refinanced Debt with like tenors to the CIC Debt and may mana ge the refinancing \nof the CIC Debt to the best of their abil ity to mitigate interest rate exposure and \nexpense.  \n(iv) The Parties further acknowledge they will (a) use reasonable efforts to \nadjust the CIC Rate Credit, to the extent required, to avoid negative impact on the \ncredit quality of SJG and ETG, and (b) en sure the terms of this Stipulation are \nimplemented consistently and in their entirety for the remaining tenor of the CIC Debt.  \n(v) The Parties acknowledge that Petiti oners should have the opportunity to \nmitigate the impact to ETG, SJG and sharehol ders if such mitigation actions do not \ncreate an adverse imp act to customers.  The Parties further acknowledge that ETG \nand SJG will retain all applicable tax benefits associated with incremental \nRefinanced Debt Interest Expense relati ve to the CIC Debt Interest Expense. \n \n36. Intercompany Lending. Neither ETG nor SJG shall lend money to SJIU, SJI, \nBoardwalk, IIF or any other affiliate of IIF. SJIU may lend money to ETG and SJG. \n \n37. Money Pool. If SJIU establishes a money pool, the only participan ts in such money \npool shall be SJG, ETG, and SJIU.  \n \n38. Credit Ratings. ETG, SJG, SJIU, and SJI must  take the actions necessary to ensure \nthe existence of ETG’s and SJG’s individua l credit and debt ratings, as applicable. \nETG and SJG will be registered with at  least one of the Nationally Recognized \nStatistical Rating Organizations (“NRSROs”) registered with the Securities and \nExchange Commission. ETG, SJG, SJIU, and SJI, as applicable, will use commercially reasonable efforts to have ETG’s and SJG’s credit ratings reflect the \nring-fencing provisions adopted in this proceeding. \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx.

Within 18 months of the closing of the Merger, SJG and ETG will submit to the \nBoard a proposal to implement a Non- Pipes Alternatives (NPA) program.   \n \na. Under the proposal, for any identified gap between forecasted supply and \ndemand - i.e.-an infrastructure or supply constraint – the utili ties will assess \nalternate options in additi on to traditional supply-side  solutions.  The utilities \nwill develop a process for soliciting propos als to provide natural gas supply or \ndemand relief.  The NPAs to be consid ered include, but are not necessarily \nlimited to, energy efficiency and de mand response measures, compressed \nnatural gas and liquified natural gas, el ectrification, and geothermal facilities.  \nThe NPA proposal will identify and address operational, billing and customer service issues raised by the use of NPAs .  The NPA proposal will also undertake \nan investigation of ways to prioritize potential NPAs in low income and environmental justice communities.  Any proposed NPA involving utility \nownership of non-gas infrastructure must  receive specific Board approval prior \nto recovery of costs in gas distribution rates. \n \nb. The utilities and Environmental Defense Fund agree to collab orate in good faith \nregarding the development of the NPA program proposal prior to submitting the proposal to the BPU. The utilities w ill meet with EDF at least two times and \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 50 of 91\n20 \n will share the proposal with EDF for comm ents before filing the proposal with \nthe Board.   \n \nc. If the NPA program proposal is approved  by the BPU, as the utilities implement \nthe program, they will each issue annua l reports detailing: (1) solicited \nproposals that were examined over the la st two years where a proposal has been \nselected, detailing the selected proposal;  (2) pending solicited proposals to be \nconsidered where a proposal has not ye t been selected; and (3) anticipated \nupcoming solicited proposals. ETG and SJG will file their annual reports \npublicly in the NJ BPU docket for this proceeding, GM22040270, with copies \nto the parties. If any of the above inform ation is unable to be provided publicly \ndue to confidentiality restrictions, th e companies shall so  indicate and shall \nprovide such information pursuant to the BPU’s procedures for handling confidential information.  Moreover, to the extent state or federal law does not \npermit the disclosure of such informati on, the companies shall not be required \nto provide the information.  \n75. ETG and SJG will provide EDF copies of gas leak reports filed with government agencies subject to appropriat e confidentiality restrictions. \n \n76. Gas Leak Equity Analysis  \n \na. By December 31, 2026, ETG will complete  a gas leak equity analysis and \ndevelop a plan to address any identifi ed disproportionate circumstances. By \nDecember 31, 2027, ETG will complete an updated version of this analysis and \nissue an updated version of the plan to address any identified  disproportionate \ncircumstances. The 2026 and 2027 analyses and plans will be filed publicly in \nthe NJ BPU docket for this proceeding, GM22040270, with copies to the parties, and will include the following components:   \ni. ETG will report gas leak density (collect ed through advanced leak detection \n+ surveys and other surveys) by cen sus tracts and census blocks.  \nii. ETG will analyze whether overburdened co mmunities in its service territory \nas defined by the New Jersey Depart ment of Environmen tal Protection are \nsubject to greater leak density than surrounding communities and develop a \nplan and program to address any disproportionate circumstances.  \niii. ETG will submit any such plans to the Parties for comment. Any disputes \nas to ETG’s plans will be submitte d to the Board for resolution.   \n \nb. By June 30, 2024, ETG will report gas leak density by census tracts and census blocks in the areas where cast iron facilities have b een replaced and provide its \nplan for continuing with such repl acement over the co ming years.   \n \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 51 of 91\n21 \n c. Any costs associated with compliance with  this provision will be capped at a \nmaximum of $300,000 per year, and ETG sh all not be required to conduct any \nsurveys or produce any reports that cause it to incur costs in excess of this cap. \n \n77. With respect to the commitme nt in Paragraph 60 of th is Stipulation, SJG and ETG \nwill provide utility specific greenhouse gas emissions data (i.e., separate out each \nutility’s data); define the term “partial” as it is used in the template with regard to \nScope 3 emissions; and explain which emi ssions sources identified in the EEI-AGA \nESG/Sustainability Metrics are included in any stated greenhouse gas emissions \nreduction goals identified in the ESG Annual Report. \n \n78. To the extent directed by statute, or to the extent the Board determines by regulation or generally applicable order, that depl oyment of hydrogen or any particular type \nof deployment of hydrogen is not consistent  with safe, reliable and adequate utility \nservice at reasonable rates, including app licable environmental policies pursuant to \nN.J.S.A. 48:2-23, SJG and ETG will not pursue any such utility or customer-\nsupported deployment of hydrogen.  Howeve r, nothing herein will prevent any \nparty from challenging the r easonableness or lawfulness  of any such statute, \nregulation, or order.  \n79. To the extent directed by statute, or to the extent the Board determines by regulation or generally applicable order,  that deployment of biomethane or any particular type \nof deployment of biomethane is not cons istent with safe, reliable and adequate \nutility service at reasonab le rates, including applicable environmental policies \npursuant to N.J.S.A. 48:2-23, SJG and ETG will not pursue any such utility or \ncustomer-supported deploymen t of biomethane.  Howe ver, nothing herein will \nprevent any party from challenging the reas onableness or lawfulness of any such \nstatute, regulation, or order. The term bi omethane refers to methane (aka, natural \ngas) derived from sources other than fossils , such as livestock operations, landfills, \nand gasification of agricultural crop residue, yard and wood waste.  \n80. In any matter before the NJ  BPU involving initial consid eration or review of any \nSJG/ETG investment in or deployment of hydrogen or biomethane, SJG/ETG will \ncomply with all regulations or rules adopted by the Board that require the \nCompanies to provide information concer ning such investme nts or deployments. \nAny party may contend, and any party may oppose such contention, that the \nfollowing topics would be relevant for disc overy and analysis in such a proceeding: \nanalysis and quantification of the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with a hydrogen or biomethane investme nt or deployment; safety; community \nimpacts, including overburde ned communities; and da ta related thereto. \n \n \nM. Miscellaneous \n81. The Signatory Parties Joint Petitions, BP U Staff, Rate Counsel, and NJLEUC shall \nuse their best efforts to ensure that this  Stipulation be presented to the Board for \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-___, SLV-S-3 \nPage 52 of 91\n22 \n approval at its January 25, 2023 public agenda  meeting in order to facilitate the \nClosing of the Transaction on a timely basi s.  The Signatory Party EDF supports a \ntimely resolution of this matter; \n \n82. This Stipulation represents the entire ty of the agreement among the Signatory \nParties.  This Stipulation includes pr oposals and conditions above and beyond the \nterms contained in the Joint Petition. Notw ithstanding statements made in the Joint \nPetition, testimony, discovery materials or any information provided by the Joint \nPetitioners, only those commitments stated  in this Stipulation shall apply; \n \n83. The Signatory Parties shall support approval of the Tr ansaction upon the terms set \nforth in this Stipulation in any proceedi ngs before the Board regarding approval of \nthe Transaction.  The Signatory Parties shall defend this Stipulation in the event of opposition to approval of the Transaction from non-signatory parties before the \nBoard;  \n84. It is the intent of the Signatory Parties that the provisions he reof be approved by \nthe Board as being in the public interest. The Signatory Parties further agree that they consider the Stipulation to be bi nding on them for all purposes herein;  \n \n85. In the event any particular aspect of th is Stipulation is not accepted and approved \nin its entirety by the Board, any Signator y Party aggrieved th ereby shall not be \nbound to proceed with this Stipulation and shall have the right to litigate all issues addressed herein to a conclusion.  More par ticularly, in the event this Stipulation is \nnot adopted in its entirety by the Board, in any applicable Order(s), then any \nSignatory Party hereto is free to pursue its then available legal remedies with \nrespect to all issues addressed in this S tipulation as though this Stipulation had not \nbeen signed;  \n86. This Stipulation shall become effectiv e and be binding on th e Signatory Parties \nafter the issuance of a Board Order approvi ng this Stipulation or upon such date as \nthe Board may specify.  This Stipulation contains terms and conditions above and \nbeyond the terms contained in the Joint Petition, each of which is interdependent with the others and essential in its own right  to the signing of this Stipulation.  Each \nterm is vital to the agreement as a whole, because the Signatory Parties expressly and jointly state that they would not have signed the Sti pulation had any term been \nmodified in any way.  None of the Signato ry Parties shall be prohibited from or \nprejudiced in arguing a diffe rent policy or position befo re the Board in any other \nproceeding, as such agreements pertain only to this matter and to no other matter;  \n87. This Stipulation sets forth a compromise of divergent positions and shall not be \nregarded as precedent in any future case.  Except as expressly provided herein, no \nSignatory Party shall be deem ed to have approved, agreed  to, or consented to any \nprinciple or methodology underlying or supposed to underlie any agreement \nprovided herein; and  \n  \nPRELIMINARY PUBLIC COPY\nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx.

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION  1 \nQ. Please state your name, business address, and position.  2 \nA. My name is Mark Ellis. My business address is 8595 Nottingham Place, La Jolla, CA 92037. 3 \nI am a self -employed utility finance expert.  4 \nQ. Please summarize your education and professional experience.  5 \nA. I am a former utility executive now working as an independent consultant and testifying 6 \nexpert  in finance and economics in utility regulatory proceedings. I have over 30 years of 7 \nexperience in finance -related roles in the energy industry, including 15 years as the head of 8 \nstrategy for Sempra, now the 4th largest American utility company. Previously, I worked as a 9 \nconsultant in McKinsey’s energy practice, in international project development for 10 \nExxonMobil, and in industrial demand -side management for Southern California Edison. I 11 \nhave an M.S. from MIT’s Technology and Policy Program, where I focused on utility policy 12 \nand conducted research in the MIT Energy Lab, and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from 13 \nHarvard. Please s ee the attached statement of qualifications , Schedule ME -1, for additional 14 \ninformation about my  background . 15 \nQ. Have you previously testified before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission 16 \n(Commission  or MPUC )?  17 \nA. No. 18 \nQ. On whose behalf are you submitting testimony?  19 \nA. I am submitting testimony on behalf of CURE.  20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n5 Q. What is the purpose of your testimony in this proceeding?  1 \nA. The purpose of my testimony  is to contribute constructively to the record in order to assist 2 \nthe Commission in addressing several issues relevant to its dec ision in this case , the proposed 3 \nsale of Minnesota Power (MP), a regulated utility that is part of ALLETE, to Global 4 \nInfrastructure Partners (GIP) and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP).  My 5 \ntestimony will address the  following issues:  potential harms to the public interest from the 6 \nproposed transaction , particularly in relation to cost; overall consistency with the public 7 \ninterest; and impacts on MP ’s ability to comply with the Carbon -Free Energy Standard 8 \n(CES).1 I also discuss some potential regulatory requirements or commitments that could  9 \nrender the proposed transaction consistent with the public interest.  10 \nQ. Please summarize your  findings and  conclusions.  11 \nA. My testimony covers three topics I believe merit the Commission’s and the public’s attention 12 \nand consideration:  (1) the transaction’s  expected  adverse  impact on residential rate s and 13 \nimplications for the CES ; (2) how the proposed transaction proves, unequivocally, that MP’s 14 \nauthorized rate of return (ROR)  is excessive , and that excessive RO Rs are the key motivation 15 \nfor the transaction and the root cause of the forecast unprecedented rate increases ; and (3) 16 \ntwo proposed systemic solutions to problem of excessive ROEs, which are not unique to MP 17 \nor Minnesota.  18 \n \n1  Order Requiring Additional Information and Granting Intervention, and Notice of and Order \nfor Hearing, In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners , PUC Docket No. \nE-015/PA -24-198, Oct. 7, 2024, p. 8,  available at  \nhttps://www.edockets.state.mn.us/documents/%7B50096892 -0000 -CC10 -87F7 -\n25B2F5169160%7D/download . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n6 The proposed transaction  would impose an  untenable economic burden on MP’s residential 1 \ncustomers . [Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins   2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n Section based on highly 6 \nconfidential trade secret information ends]  7 \nI also demonstrate how MP’s authorized RO R, by providing extraordinary returns on 8 \ninvestment  well above the statutorily  mandated cost of capital  (COC), creates perverse 9 \nincentives to maximize capital spendin g and is the root cause  of the proposed rate increases.  I 10 \nthen explain and demonstrate  how these already powerful financial incentives would be 11 \nexacerbated under GIP’ s ownership, due to its financial compensation structure  as a private 12 \nequity investment fund.  13 \nI then propose two solutions  to the  systemic problem of excessive authorized RORs. The first 14 \nis standardiz ing and codify ing the process of calculating ROR and assigning responsibility 15 \nfor that analysis to the Commission . The second is to introduce competition for the provision 16 \nof equity directly to MP  (not ALLETE), with capital providers competing on the basis of 17 \nlowest offered  return , not highest offered price . These solutions would offer significant 18 \nbenefits, both immediately in the form of materially lower rates, and over the long term in 19 \nmitig ating, and potentially eliminating, the perverse incentive to maximize rate  base at 20 \ncustomer  expense . 21 \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n7 In conclusion, I recommend the Commission reject the transaction . Not because private 1 \nequity ownership of MP is not in the public interest, per se. Rather, proceeding with this 2 \ntransaction would obfuscate and exacerbate two critical issues that merit further 3 \ninvestigation , public engagement , and resolution : the cost to MP customers of meeting the 4 \nCES; and the Commission’s practice of authori zing excessive ROEs  and the perverse 5 \nincentives thereby created . The Commission should provide itself and stakeholders the time, 6 \ninformation, and opportunity required to do so.  7 \n[Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins  8 \n  9 \n 10 \n  11 \n Section based on highly confidential trade secret information ends]  12 \nQ. What are the implications of the proposed transaction for MP residential rates?  13 \nA.

EXCESSIVE AUTHORIZED ROE S AND THE TRADITIONAL PRIV ATE 1 \nEQUITY COMPENSATION STRUCTURE : A TOXIC COMBINATION  2 \nD. The Normative Standard for Setting Authorized ROEs Is Well -Established 3 \nand Universally Recognized.  4 \nQ. Before you were an independent consultant, you worked for Sempra.  In what business 5 \nactivities is Sempra engaged?  6 \nA. Sempra is probably best known as the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern 7 \nCalifornia Gas , its legacy utility businesses. Sempra also owns Oncor  (a Texas electric 8 \ndistribution utility ) and a portfolio of energy infrastructure assets in Mexico, and i s a leading 9 \ndeveloper of LNG export facilities in the US. Depending on the day’s market activity, 10 \nSempra alternates with AEP for the 4th and 5th largest US utility holding compan ies. 11 \nQ. You were Sempra’s Chief of Corporate Strategy and Chief Economist.  In those roles, 12 \ndid you work on transactions like the one under review in this proceeding?  13 \nA. Yes. Among my responsibilit ies at Sempra, I developed strategic and valuation frameworks 14 \nfor the company’s major initiatives – investments  (both greenfield and acquisitions ), 15 \ndivestments, policy positions  (e.g., on climate change) , and technology  selection.  I was also 16 \nresponsible for reviewing the financial model and economic case for major investments , and 17 \nfor the enterprise -wide cost of capital function , a critical input into nearly all forward -looking 18 \nfinancial analyses.  The expertise and insight I developed from that experience are directly 19 \nrelevant and applicable to the proposed transaction.  20 \nQ. Do you have any other experience or expertise relevant to this proceeding?  21 \nA. Since leaving Sempra in 2019, I have been working as an expert witness in finance and 22 \neconomics in ut ility regulatory proceedings on behalf of consumer and environmental 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n16 organizations. I am also Senior Fellow  for Utilities at the American Economic Liberties 1 \nProject (AELP), an anti -monopoly think tank.  2 \nOne of my focus areas is utilities’ authorized  rate of return  (ROR) . I recently published a 3 \npaper (included with my testimony as Schedule ME -2) for AELP explai ning, to a policy - 4 \nmaker audience  ROR’s centrality to u tility profitability and decision -making.11 The paper  5 \ndiscusses  the legal principles , grounded in long -standing Supreme Court  precedent , that are 6 \nsupposed to guide regulators in setting a just a nd reasonable ROR : equal to the market -based 7 \ncost of capital , the “ROR=COC standard .” 8 \nQ. Which Supreme Court Cases established the ROR=COC standard?  9 \nA. The principle that rate of return should be set equal to the cost of capital  dates back to a 10 \nconcurring opinion penned by Supreme Court Justice Brandeis in 192312 and was formally 11 \nadopted by the full Court in its landmark 1944 Hope Natural Gas  decision.13 MP cost of 12 \ncapital witness Ann Bulkley’s Brattle Group colleague s, Lawrence Kolbe  and James Read , 13 \nexplain ed the derivation of the ROR=COC standard  from Hope  in their book, The Cost of   14 \n \n11 Mark Ellis, Rate of Return Equals Cost  of Capital: A Simple, Fair Formula  to Stop Investor -\nOwned Utilities from  Overcharging  the Public , American Economic Liberties Project (Jan. \n2025), https://www.economicliberties.us/wp -content/uploads/2025/01/20250102 -aelp-ror-\nv5.pdf . Schedule ME-2.  \n12 Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Svc. Comm’n, 262 U.S. 276, 291 (1923) (“The \ncompensation which the Constitution guarantees an opportunity to earn is the reasonable cost \nof conducting the business. Cost includes, not only operating expenses, but also capital \ncharges. Capital charges cover the allowance, by way of interest, for the use of the capital, \nwhatever the nature of the security issued therefor, the allowance for risk incurred, and enough \nmore to attract capital.”).  \n13 FPC v. Hope Nat. Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591 (1944) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n17 Capital: Estimating the Rate of Return for Public Utilitie s – the very title an explicit 1 \nendorsement of the standard . They  begin by citing the relevant passage of Hope : 2 \nThe ratemaking process under the [Natural Gas] Act, i.e., the fixing of “just and 3 \nreasonable ” rates, involves a balancing of the investor and the consumer interests. 4 \n… From the investor or company point of view, it is  important that there be 5 \nenough revenue not only for operating expenses, but also for the capital costs of 6 \nthe business. These include service on  the debt and dividends on the stock ... By 7 \nthat standard, the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns 8 \non investments in other enterprises having corresponding risk s.14 9 \nKolbe and Read  continue:  10 \nSince by definition the cost of capital of a regulated firm represents precisely the 11 \nexpected return that investors could anticipate from other investments while 12 \nbearing no more and no less risk, and since investors will not provide capital 13 \nunless the investment  is expected to yield its opportunity cost of capital, the 14 \ncorrespondence of the definition of the cost of capital  with the court’s definition 15 \nof legally required earnings appears clear. H ope refers to both “commensurate” 16 \nearnings and the attraction of capital. These two approaches are harmonized when 17 \nthe allowed rate of return is set equal to the cost of capital.15 18 \nIn short, “the return … commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having 19 \ncorresponding risks” is simply the “opportunity cost of capital .” 20 \nQ. Does the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission recognize the ROR=COC standard?  21 \nYes, and so does MP. As Ann E. Bulkley, MP’s cost of capital expert , explains,  citing 22 \nMinnesota Stat. § 216B.16, subd. 6,  “In determining just and reasonable rates, the 23 \nCommission is required to give due consideration to the utility’s cost of furnishing service  24 \nwhich includ es a fair reasonable return on investment .” She defines a fair and  reasonable 25 \nreturn as one sufficient to attract capital , i.e., the market -based “cost of capital. ” She 26 \n \n14 FPC v. Hope Nat. Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, at 603  (1944) . \n15 A. Lawrence Kolbe, James A. Read Jr., and George R. Hall, The Cost of Capital: Estimating \nthe Rate of Return for Public Utilities , p. 21 -25 (MIT Press, 1984).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n18 concludes  by equating the “market -required ROE” with the “cost of equity.”16 Consistent 1 \nwith this principle, in MP’s most recent rate case, Ms. Bulkley describ ed the purpose of her 2 \ntestimony as “provid[ing] a recommendation regarding the appropriate return on equity ,” 3 \nthen “estimated [MP’s] cost of equity  by applying several traditional estimation 4 \nmethodologies”  and equated the two.17 5 \nQ. Have other regulatory bodies endorsed the ROR=COC standard?  6 \nA. Similarly, MP access to capital witness John D. Quackenbush, in a report for the National 7 \nAssociation of Regulatory Utilit y Commissioners (NARUC ), of which Minnesota is a 8 \nmember18, summarizes the basis for the ROR=COC standard:  9 \n“Fundamental financial concepts demonstrate that the fair rate of return to use in 10 \nratemaking for a utility is its cost of capital in order to achieve the proper balance 11 \nbetween customers and investors .”19 12 \nFERC has similarly endorsed the ROR=COC standard:  13 \nThere is compelling economic justification for relying on the market cost of 14 \ncapital as the standard for rate of return decisions.

Does your AELP paper cover any other issues pertinent to th e transaction under 12 \nconsideration in this  proceeding?  13 \nA. Yes. It provides compelling evidence that regulators have been in violation of this standard 14 \nfor decades, authorizing ROEs far above  utilities’ market -based COE . Excess ROEs  unjustly 15 \nbenefit utility shareholders  at a cost to their customers of approximately $50 billion per year. 16 \nThe paper concludes with several recommendations to address this long -standing and critical 17 \nproblem.  18 \n \n20 Ass’n of Bus.

Excessive Authorized ROE s Are a Perpetual  License for a Utility to  Pick Its 1 \nCustomer s’ Pocket s. 2 \nQ. What are the implications of excess authorized ROEs for understanding this 3 \ntransaction and assessing whether it is in the public interest?  4 \nA. Essentially, utilities raise capital at a relatively low cost – i.e., the cost of capital or expected 5 \nreturn22 – in financial markets and invest it in long -lived infrastructure at a significantly 6 \nhigher return – the authorized rate of return.  We know this  is true because t he foundational 7 \nprinciple of finance  – discounted present value – tells us that an asset ’s value will equal the 8 \ncost of the initial investment if and only if its expected rate of return  is equal to  its risk- 9 \nadjusted cost of capital.  [Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins 10 \n 11 \n Section based on highly confidential trade secret information ends]  In a 12 \nprocess that can only be called financial alchemy, excess RORs turn every dollar of 13 \nshareholder capital invested by a utility operating company into a multiple – currently 14 \napproximately 2.2x – in shareholder market capitalization.23 15 \nThis premium , known as the price - or market -to-book ratio (P/B or M/B, respectively)  16 \nreflects the expected future wealth transfer from customers to utility shareholders  arising 17 \n \n22 See, e.g., Tim Koller, Marc Goedhart, and David Wessels, Valuation  (5th ed., Wiley, 2010), p. \n35 (“The cost of capital is the price charged by investors for bearing the risk that the \ncompany’s future cash flows may differ from what they anticipate when they make the \ninvestment. The cost of capital to a company equals the  minimum return that investors expect \nto earn from investing in the company. That is why the terms expected return to investors  and \ncost of capital  are essentially the same. The cost of capital is also called the discount rate, \nbecause you discount future cash flows at this rate when calculating the present value of an \ninvestment, to reflect what you will have to pay investors.”).  \n23 This reflects the S&P 1500 Util ities Index P/B as of January 17, 2025.

What have ALLETE  and its shareholders done to deserve this $1.5-billion premium to 1 \nthe cost of their investment ? 2 \nA. Nothing. It’s not compensation for past performance ; they have already been richly rewarded, 3 \nwith an ROE far in excess of the statutory COE standard, for their past oversight  and 4 \noperation of MP. It’s not compensation for future performance ; they are selling the business 5 \nso, by definition, they are no longer doing anything for which they deserve compensation.  6 \nG. ALLETE’S  Unearned Windfall Is a Regulatory Choice . 7 \nQ. So what does the $1.5 billion that GIP/CPP are offering ALLETE  shareholders on top 8 \nof their actual investment reflect?  9 \nA. ALLETE  shareholders ’ $1.5-billion windfall is purely and only an artifact of MP’s MPUC - 10 \ngranted p ocket -picking monopoly . They are paying up -front for the future value of the excess 11 \nprofits , arising from authorized ROEs greater than MP’s market -based COE, that GIP/CPP  12 \nexpect the Commission  to continue to allow MP to collect . 13 \nQ. That’s a strong claim. Please explain.  14 \nA. I’m going to use a simplified, but relatively accurate, mathematical description of the basic 15 \nutility financial model.  16 \nIf one were to look at GIP/CPP’s financial model for this transaction, they would quickly 17 \nbecome overwhelmed by its detail , size, and complexity. At root, though, utilit ies have a 18 \nsimple  business model : profit is a fixed fraction  (the ROE ) of invested capital , which grows 19 \nsteadily over time . Utility cash flow profile s are predictable and stable  and, therefore , 20 \nrelatively easy to value . As a result, f inance professionals and economists have  been able to 21 \ndevelop simple mathematical models that accurately capture the  inter-relationships between 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n23 the key economic levers of the utility business  model – ROE, COE,  book equity (i.e., the 1 \nequity portion of its rate base) , and growth  – and its market value . 2 \nOne such model that accurately captures the key value -drivers in this transaction is the  3 \nsustainable -growth discounted cash flow  model (SGDCF) , which expresses the relationshi ps 4 \nbetween the key economic levers as follows:  5 \nP/B = ROE (1 – b) / (COE – b ROE),  6 \nwhere b is the  plowback ratio , the share of annual profit that is reinvested in the utility to 7 \ngrow its book equity.27 The product of the plowback ratio and ROE  (b ROE) is the utility’s 8 \ngrowth rate , so as either b or ROE increase s, the growth rate increases as well.  9 \nFigure 3 shows how P/B changes as ROE increases  above COE (assumed constant here) , for 10 \ndifferent plowback ratios . Increasing plowback ratios,  starting from 0%, are represented by 11 \nlines of increasing thickness.  12 \nA few things to note. First, for any given plow back ratio, P/B increase s with ROE. This is 13 \njust common sense. ROE is profit per dollar of book value; higher profits are more valuable.  14 \nSecond , for any given ROE, P/B increases with plowback ratio , at an increasingly steeper 15 \nrate. A utility’ s value increases non -linearly with growth .28 One important implication is that, 16 \nif an investor can buy a utility at a P/B predicated on a certain plowback ratio and growth 17 \nrate, it can dramatically increase the value of its investment by increasing the growth rate.  18 \n 19 \n \n27 Myron J. Gordon, The Cost of Capital to a Public Utility , MSU Public Utility Studies, p. 27-\n30 (1974) . All other terms are as described previously.  \n28 While  not directly observable in the chart, for any given ROE and COE, P/B increases at a rate \nfaster than exponential with growth ( b x ROE).  \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n24 Finally, when ROE is equal to COE, P/B is equal to 1.0, regardless of the plowback ratio or 1 \ngrowth rate. This is consistent with the present value principle of finance; if a utility is just 2 \nearning its cost of equity – which is the legal standard – its P/B should equal 1.0.  This is true 3 \nregardless of the growth rate.  4 \nFigure 3. Sustainable -growth DCF model illustrating the relationship between utility ROE, 5 \nCOE, and P/B  6 \n 7 \nH.

How can GIP /CPP pay such a large premium and still meet their investors’ return 10 \nexpectations?  11 \nA. Prior to the transaction, ALLETE ’s share price indicated that MP’s market value exceeded  its 12 \nbook value, i.e., investors expected MP’s ROE to exceed its COE.29 GIP/CPP are paying a 13 \n \n29 ALLETE, Merger Proposed - Notice of a Special Meeting - Proxy Information, July 10,  2024,  \nhttps://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/018522/20240701/NO MP_581536.PDF . \nP/B=1.0ROE=COE\nP/B\nROEb(and g)\n= 0%\nIncreasing b\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n25 substantial premium over ALLETE ’s pre -transaction market  value.30 The only way GIP/CPP 1 \ncan justify this premium is if they expect  to increase MP’s ROE and/or growth above what 2 \nALLETE ’s investors expected prior to the transaction.  3 \nLike other private equity firms, GIP and CPP have made commitments to their  investors to 4 \nmeet certain return target s. In addit ion, private equity firms typically have performance -based  5 \ncompensation plans that offer employee s financial incentives linked to  the increase in value 6 \nof the assets they acquire.31 GIP/CPP  and their fund managers have powerful  organizational 7 \nand personal incentives to increase the value of MP . 8 \nI. The Traditional Private Equity Compensation Structure E ncourage s 9 \nGIP/CPP to Dig Ever Deeper Into MP Customer Pockets . 10 \nQ. How will GIP/CPP increase the value of MP?  11 \nA. As the SGDCF illustrates, GIP/CPP  basically have two levers for increasing the value of MP: 12 \nexpanding  ROE and growing rate base.

Please pause  your explanation  of your analysis . You say MP’s COE is about 6.0%? That 1 \nis much lower than their authorized ROE of close to 10%. Please elaborate . 2 \nA. My paper for AELP (Exhibit ME -2) discusses this issue in detail. Currently, the cost of equity 3 \nfor US utilities is on the order of 5% to 6%. Included in the evidence presented in the paper 4 \nare professional investment management firms’  estimates of investors’ expected market 5 \nreturns.  According to GIP owner BlackRock’s most recent forecast (as of September 30, 6 \n2024 ), the long -term ( 30-year) expected return, i.e., the cost of equity, for US equities is 7 \n7.4%.52 8 \nUtilities are lower risk than the market as a whole, so their expected return should be 9 \ncorrespondingly lower. A common model used to estimate the cost of equity is the capital 10 \nasset pricing model (CAPM), which expresses the COE as the long -term Treasury expected 11 \nreturn (2.8%) plus a risk -factor, β, multiplied by the difference between the expected returns 12 \non the market as a whole and long -term Treasurys. As of September 30, 2024, the utility β is 13 \n0.6, so the utility COE is 3.0% + 0.6 (7. 4% – 3.0%) = 5. 6%.53 14 \n[Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins  15 \n 16 \n 17 \n 18 \n 19 \n \n52 BlackRock, Capital market assumptions , Nov. 19, 2024, \nhttps://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en -us/insights/charts/capital -market -assumptions . \n53 Utility β calculated from 5 years of monthly returns from the French Data Library, Current \nResearch Returns, available at  \nhttps://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html . \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n34 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n 11 \n12 \n \n54 Regulatory Assistance Project, Improving Utility Performance Incentives in the  United States : \nA Policy, Legal and Financial Framework for Utility Business Model  Reform , p. 2 (Oct. 2023), \n, p. 2. https://www.raponline.org/wp -content/uploads/2023/10/rap -improving -utility -\nperformance -incentives -in-the-united -states -2023 -october.pdf . \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n35  1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n 11 \n 12 \n 13 \n 14 \n 15 \n 16 \n 17 \n Section based on highly confidential trade secret information ends]  18 \nALLETE  maintains they are unable to raise equity capital, which explains why they are 19 \nwilling to sell this right to GIP/CPP.

Two Unambiguous Facts  About the Proposed Sale of MP Pr ove 8 \nUnequivocal ly That MP’s ROE Is Excessive . 9 \nQ. You’ve gone into a lot of technical detail on ROR, COC, and PV . Can you summarize 10 \nthe key findings and conclusions?  11 \nThere are two unambiguous, undeniable facts staring us in the face in th is transaction: (1) 12 \nALLETE shareholders would walk away with a $1.5 -billion gain on the  actual  cost of their 13 \ninvestment in MP; and (2) GIP/CPP are willing to pay this premium only because they expect 14 \nit to be profitable, i.e., meet or exceed their expected investment return target s. The purpose 15 \nof the a ll the analysis is to prove, in the most irrefutable  way possible by invoking only the 16 \nmost fundamental principle of finance – discounted present value – that these two facts can 17 \nbe true if and only if MP’s current and expected future authorized ROE far exceeds its COE.  18 \nThis transaction makes crystal clear what seems to elude this Commission and other 19 \nregulators among the flurry of competing theories, methodologies, models, assumptions, and 20 \nresults in the typical rate of return process: authorized ROEs are systematically too high,   21 \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n43 have been for decades, and investors in both the public and private capital markets expect 1 \nthem to continue into perpetuity.  2 \nThis transaction presents the Commission and the broader Minnesota public an opportunity 3 \nto confront th e problem of excessive RORs and do something about it. The alternative is to 4 \ncontinue  to allow MP and its IOU peers to continue to pick the pockets of their unwitting 5 \ncustomers, forever.  6 \nIV. FIXING THE CORE  PROBLEM WITH THE UTILITY REGULATORY MODEL: 7 \nINSTITUTIONALIZE  THE ROR =COC STANDARD  8 \nO. Standardize and Codify  ROR=COC  to Ensure Compliance with the 9 \nSCOTUS mandate . 10 \n1. The ROR=COC Standard Offers Numerous  Immediate Benefits.  11 \nQ. How would you address  MP’s situation?  12 \nA. I have two proposed solutions. The first is straightforward and, frankly, long overdue. The 13 \nCommission  should move as quickly as possible to  implement a process to systematically, 14 \nreliably, efficiently, and transparently comply  with the SCOTUS -mandated ROR=COC 15 \nstandard . Doing so offers five significant benefits.  16 \n[Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins  17 \n 18 \n 19 \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n44  1 \n 2 \n Section based on highly confidential trade secret information ends]  3 \nSecond, complying with  the ROR=COC standard would eliminate  the potential for capital 4 \nbias, the incentive for MP, whether owned by GIP/CPP or retained by its current 5 \nshareholders, to inflate rate base in order to increase investor  value. As explained above, 6 \nwhen ROE is equal to COE, there’s no financial alchemy upside  – no opportunity to boost 7 \nreturns above the cost of capital  – regardless of the plowback ratio (even b > 100%) or 8 \ngrowth rate . When equity is raised, investors get only their expected return. Because 9 \ninvestors  gain nothing from merely growing rate base, they have no incentive to do so for its 10 \nown sake, but only as needed to ensure safe and reliable service in compliance with all 11 \napplicable laws and regulations.  12 \nThird, setting ROR equal to COC minimizes the cost of the investment that is needed. 13 \nRecovering only actual capital costs in rates – depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, 14 \nand net income – [Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins   15 \n Section 16 \nbased on highly confidential trade secret information ends]  17 \nFourth, as the Regulatory Assistance Project has documented, excessive ROEs crowd out the 18 \nincentive effects of performance -based ratemaking: any reasonable performance award is 19 \n \n  \n \n  \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n45 dwarfed by the value created just by growing rate base.63 I witnessed this first -hand at 1 \nSempra. ROR=COC  creates a financially level playing field , where performance incentives 2 \ncan fulfill  their intended purpose . In so doing, the ROR=COC  standard is the antidote to 3 \ncapital bias . 4 \nThese first four benefits relate to regulatory outcomes. The fifth benefit is internal to the 5 \nCommission , arising from the aforementioned “process to systematically, reliably, efficiently, 6 \nand transparently comply  with the SCOTUS -mandated ROR=COC standard .” 7 \n2. Just a Few Straightforward, Practical Policies Can Ensure Compliance 8 \nWith the ROR=COC Standard . 9 \nQ. What do es your first proposed solution entail ? 10 \nA. I envision several steps.  First, clarify in regulation or, if necessary, legislation, that  (1) 11 \n“authorized rate of return ” and “cost of capital ” are two distinct  concepts ; and (2) that the 12 \nauthorized rate of return must  be set equal to the market -based cost of capital.  13 \nQ. Why is the clarification of ROR and COC necessary?  14 \nCurrently, t he two terms  are frequently used interchangeably – for example, in MP’s required 15 \nGRC filing, “ Schedule D -1: Rate of Return / Cost of Capital .”64 Utility ROR experts have 16 \nexploit ed this confusion to promulgate a nd propagate  a classic is -ought fallacy : because ROR 17 \nis supposed to be  equal to COC, it is equal to COC. For example, they have successfully 18 \n \n63 Regulatory Assistance Project, Improving Utility Performance Incentives in the United States: \nA Policy, Legal and Financial Framework for Utility Business Model Reform , p. 2 (Oct. 2023), \nhttps://www.raponline.org/wp -content/uploads/2023/10/rap -improving -utility -performance -\nincentives -in-the-united -states -2023 -october.pdf . \n64 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority  to Increase Electric Service \nRates in Minnesota , PUC Docket  No. E015/GR -23-155, p. 67 , eDockets No. 202311 -200092 -\n10. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n46 introduced analyses  that reference only other authorized ROEs – the FERC -banned risk 1 \npremium and expected earnings models65 – without  even a pretense of estimating a market - 2 \nbased cost of capital.  To its  credit , this Commission recognizes the flaws with these models 3 \nand has rejected their results.66 4 \nThe confusion and lack of clarity between ROR and COC, and utilities’ exploitation of them , 5 \nseems to have facilitated the decades -long slide into our current situation, where not a single 6 \njurisdiction in the entire country is in compliance with the SCOTUS ROR=COC standard.  7 \nQ. What is your second step  to ensure compliance with the ROR=COC standard ? 8 \nA. Second, standardize and codify the process for calculating COC. Utilities frequently assert 9 \nthat COC  is “more art than science.” Under this pretext,  utility ROR experts have , over the 10 \nlast several decades,  introduced a variety of methodologies, models, and assumptions that 11 \nlack any empirical or theoretical basis and often “def[y] general financial logic,” as FERC 12 \ndescribed one commonly used model.67 Following FERC’s lead, such approaches should be 13 \nbanned outright.  14 \n \n65 Zack Hale, DC Circuit ruling gives FERC new chance to establish durable transmission \nROEs , S&P Global, Aug. 12, 2022 , https://www.spglobal.com/market -intelligence/en/news -\ninsights/articles/2022/8/dc -circuit -ruling -gives -ferc-new-chance -to-establish -durable -\ntransmission -roes-71694369 . \n66  Findings of Fact, Conclusions, and Order, In the Matter of the Application of Northern States \nPower Company, dba Xcel Energy, for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in the \nState of Minnesota , MPUC Docket No. E -002/GR -21-630, p. 89 , July 17, 2023 , \nhttps://www.edockets.state.mn.us/documents/%7BC0236589 -0000 -C115 -A5A9 -\nE96843D1FFF6%7D/download?contentSequence=0&rowIndex=58 . \n67 Zack Hale, DC Circuit ruling gives FERC new chance to establish durable transmission \nROEs , S&P Global, Aug. 12, 2022, https://www.spglobal.com/market -intelligence/en/news -\ninsights/articles/2022/8/dc -circuit -ruling -gives -ferc-new-chance -to-establish -durable -\ntransmission -roes-71694369 . \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n47 Q. Do you agree?  1 \nA. I strongly disagree. Cost of capital is a topic in which I have decades of real -world practical 2 \nexperience as well as deep and nuanced technical understanding. I researched, designed, 3 \nimplemented, and oversaw the cost of capital function for one of the largest US utility 4 \nholding companies with an unusually diverse portfolio of businesses. Sempra relied on the 5 \nprocess I created in making multi -billion -dollar investment decisions.  6 \nBut Sempra is not unique. Virtually every company that invests in long -lived assets must 7 \ncalculate a cost of capital. Given its importance, it is one of the most thoroughly researched 8 \nareas of finance.  The basic methodologies and models are well -established and rest on sound 9 \ntheoretical and empirical foundations  developed over the last 70 -plus years . They are simple 10 \n– typically taught in introductory finance courses – the necessary input data are widely 11 \navailable , and , properly implemented, they produce consistent results . As demonstrated  in my 12 \nAELP paper, there is remarkable consensus about what the market -based cost of equity is.68 13 \nQ. What is the third step to ensure compliance with the ROR=COC standard?  14 \nA. Third, o nce codified, responsibility for calculating COC should rest with the Commission  15 \n(subject to appeal), not utilities. The Commission  is much better positioned to maintain and 16 \nensure  quality, transparency, consistency , and objectivity  across the utilities in its jurisdiction.  17 \n \n68 Mark Ellis, Rate of Return Equals Cost of Capital: A Simple, Fair Formula to Stop Investor -\nOwned Utilities from Overcharging the Public , American Economic Liberties Project, p. 7 (Jan. \n2025), https://www.economicliberties.us/wp -content/uploads/2025/01/20250102 -aelp-ror-\nv5.pdf .

It would also dramatically reduce the time, cost, effort , and angst  involved  3 \nrelative to the “dueling experts” status quo.  Minnesota would not be acting alone; a bill to 4 \nthis effect is currently under consideration in New York.70 5 \n3. Frequently Invoked Objections to the ROR=COC Standard Are Red 6 \nHerrings and Do Not Survive  Scrutiny.  7 \nQ. Doesn’t the ROR=COC standard risk under -investment?  8 \nA. No. The market -based cost of capital is, by definition, th e return sufficient to attract any 9 \ndesired level investment.  10 \nKeep in mind, a pproximately 30% of US electricity demand is met by publicly -owned 11 \nutilities  (POU s). Their customer satisfaction, reliability, and environmental performance are 12 \ncomparable to IOUs.71 They operate on a true cost -of-service model, with no mark -up on 13 \ntheir financing costs  akin to IOUs’ excess ROEs. They manage to keep the lights on without 14 \nany financial alchemy. There’s no reason IOUs can’t as well.  15 \nQ.

For IOUs’ cost of equity, even if we enforce the ROR=COC standard, won’t we 1 \nstill have to rely on regulators to estimate the market -based cost of capital ? 2 \nA. Yes, that is a challenge.  I have two things to say about that.  First, we shouldn’t let the perfect 3 \nbe the enemy of the good. The evidence that authorized ROEs far exceed the market -based 4 \nCOE is overwhelming and compelling, with th is transaction serving as a particularly 5 \npoignant example.  Regulators can confidently reduce ROEs to approximately 6% 6 \nimmediately.  From there, utility price -to-book ratios can, in the words of  Kolbe  and Read , 7 \nMP COC  expert Bulkley’s Brattle Group colleague s, be used “as a guide for regulators,” 8 \nadjusting ROEs until P/B approaches 1.0.72 9 \nQ. What is your second  point about continuing to rely on regulators to set ROR?  10 \nA. My second thought  is that the potential to leverage markets to provide an unambiguous, 11 \nobservable cost of equity for utilities has never been explored and, therefore, never been 12 \nimplemented. The existing utility regulat ory paradigm –an equity  (but not for debt) financing 13 \nmonopoly inextricably attached to the “natural” operating monopoly, with the return set by 14 \nregulatory fiat  – dates back over 100 years. In that time, f inancial markets have become 15 \nunrecognizably sophisticated and liquid  and can aggregate, segregate, and accurately price 16 \nrisk in an infinite number of ways , with no better example than the transaction under 17 \nconsideration in this proceeding.  18 \nCreating a market mechanism that provides an unambiguous, transparent, and competitively 19 \ndetermined utility cost of equity would be relatively straightforward . It would also unlock   20 \n \n72 Kolbe et al., The Cost of Capital: Estimating the Rate of Return for Public Utilities,  p. 25  \n(1984 ). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n50 large pools of low -cost, patient capital currently sidelined from the utility sector by 1 \nunnecessary risks and costs that are not inherent to utilities’ underlying business, but are 2 \npurely artifacts of the dominant financing paradigm adopted by regulators.  3 \nI will discuss this potential solution to the challenge of regulating the return on equity later in 4 \nmy testimony.  5 \nQ. Wouldn’t reducing ROEs adversely impact utility stock prices?  6 \nA. Yes. Utility stock s would trade down, but as the Supreme Court established  in Hope , 7 \nregulators are not obligated to maintain utility stock valuations , and that such an obligation 8 \nwould make a nonsense of regulators’ consumer protection  mandate : 9 \nRate-making is indeed but one species of price -fixing. . . . The fixing of prices, 10 \nlike other applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property 11 \nwhich is being regulated. But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean that 12 \nthe regulation is invalid. . . . It does, however, indicate that “fair value” is the end 13 \nproduct of the process of ratemaking, not the starting point , as the Circuit Court 14 \nof Appeals held. The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend 15 \nupon “fair value” when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings 16 \nunder whatever rates may be anticipated .73 17 \nQ. Wouldn’t reducing MP’s ROE adversely affect MP’s and ALLETE ’s credit and ability 18 \nto raise capital?  19 \nA. I discuss this potential concern in the AELP paper described above74 and in testimony I 20 \nsubmitted in 2024 in a rate of return proceeding in California , which I am including with this 21 \n \n73 Fed.

This is because ROE 4 \naccounts for only about half of the cash flow used to assess a utility’s credit quality.  5 \nSecond, and more importantly, any potential erosion in credit quality can be easily 6 \ncounteracted with a modest increase in equity ratio. A higher equity ratio would partially 7 \noffset the customer savings of a lower  ROE, but the trade -off is not one -for-one. ROE, utility 8 \nprofits, and, as a result, customer rates, can all be reduced substantially without any adverse 9 \nimpact on a utility’s credit quality or ability to raise capital.  10 \nP.

You mentioned you have two proposed solutions for MP’s financial challenges. What is 14 \nyour second proposal ? 15 \nA.

This is what 6 \nequity markets , like that for publicly traded shares,  do. It is also w hat ALLETE has done in 7 \nthis transaction, potentially yielding a $1.5 -billion unearned windfall . 8 \nInstead, the proposal borrow s from how debt markets work : have investors bid down the 9 \nreturn  at which they’d be willing to provide equity.  I call it “competitive direct equity”  10 \n(CDE).  11 \nQ. Isn’t the “bid up the price” model – often well above book value – how other equity 12 \nissuances work, like IPOs and venture capital? Why should utilities be treated 13 \ndifferently?  14 \nA. Yes, venture capital and IPOs essentially bid up the price of the underlying asset until the 15 \nimplied expected return equals investors’ opportunity cost of capital. But there’s an important 16 \ndistinction between utilities and typical IPOs and VC. In the latter, new investors are willing 17 \nto pay more than book value because the new investors believe the existing owners offer a 18 \nproduct or service whose value is determined in a competitive  market  of some sort. The 19 \ncompany could have created a new product for an existing market (e.g., Tesla) or an entirely 20 \nnew industry (e.g., Uber, OpenAI), expanded supply in an existing market (e.g., new oil   21 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n53 wells), or just own a scarce resource (e.g., developable beachfront property). The difference 1 \nbetween what new investors are willing to pay and what the existing owners have invested is 2 \na reflection of the value created in the market of goods and services through the existing 3 \nowners’ ingenuity and risk -taking.  4 \nQ. How are utilities  different than these companies ? 5 \nA. For utilities, in contrast, the difference between what new investors are willing to pay and 6 \nwhat the existing owners have invested is a reflection solely of a regulatory decision , as 7 \nrecognized in Hope : “the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever 8 \nrates may be anticipated. ”77 The equity market for utilities is not like the market for the 9 \nequity of other companies, because the value of the equity is determined by regulatory fiat, 10 \nnot by any value created by the existing owners in the market of goods and service  through 11 \ntheir ingenuity and risk -taking . 12 \nQ. But utilities are innovative and take risks. For example, they deploy new technologies 13 \nand develop  and implement  innovative policies.  14 \nUtilities can be innovative, but the key difference is that they don’t take risk in their 15 \ninnovation. The costs of investigating and deploying new technologies are recoverable in 16 \nrates, as are the salaries of the people developing and implementing new policies.  Cost-of- 17 \nservice regulation protects utilities from most of the risks faced by companies not subject to 18 \nit. To the extent utilities have residual risk, like operational risk, it is reflected in their market - 19 \nbased cost of capital  and is adequately compensated by the ROR=COC standard . 20 \n \n77 Fed. Power Comm’n v. Hope Nat. Gas Co. , 320 U.S. 591, 601 (1944) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n54 In short, the equity markets for other companies reward the things we want markets to 1 \nreward: efficiency, innovation, quality, service, value. In contrast, the market for utility 2 \nequity mostly rewards regulatory capture,78 something we should seek to avoid or at least 3 \nminimize.  4 \nQ. Why would this produce lower ROEs  than the current process of having regulators set 5 \nROEs?  6 \nA. Investors betray through their behavior that they are willing to accept an expected return 7 \nlower than the authorized ROE. Under the present value principle, and as demonstrated in 8 \nFigure 5, if investors are willing to pay more than book value, it must be the case, 9 \nmathematically, that their expected return , i.e., the market -based COE,  is lower than 10 \nauthorized ROE s. 11 \nQ. Wouldn’t your first proposal – standardizing and codifying the calculation of COC – 12 \nproduce the same result?  13 \nA. By implement ing my first proposed solution , regulators could come much closer than they 14 \nare today to setting returns equal to the market -based cost  of capital. None theless, t hey would 15 \nstill need to rely on models and market feedback , like Kolbe  and Read ’s P/B “guide to 16 \nregulators ,” not a transparent, unambiguous number like a bond interest rate , so the ROR 17 \nwould never be exactly equal to COC . But the benefits of competitive direct equity go far 18 \nbeyond just accuracy.  19 \n \n78 If one questions how deeply entrenched regulatory capture is in the U.S., to the point of blasé \nexpectation, just look at the lead sponsor of NARUC’s annual conference: the Edison Electric \nInstitute, the utilities’ largest and most influential trade assoc iation, shamelessly displayed at \nthe top of the page. NARUC appears not to care about maintaining even a patina of propriety \nand impartiality. See NARUC, Annual Meeting, https://www.naruc.org/annual -meeting/  (last \nvisited Feb. 4, 2025).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n55 2. Competitive Direct Equity  Offers Numerous Other Benefits.  1 \nQ. What are the additional benefits  of competitive direct equity?  2 \nA. The benefit s of competitive direct equity stem primarily from its reduction of investment 3 \nrisk. The current  utility ownership paradigm  – operating companies owned  by publicly traded 4 \nparent companies  – introduces unnecessary and undesirable investment risk into what is 5 \nfundamentally a low-risk business.  Figure 7 compares the total return to shareholders (TRS ; 6 \ndividends plus capital gains ) to the  realized trailing -twelve -month ROE for the S&P 1500 7 \nUtilities Index.  TRS is eight times more volatile than ROE.79 8 \n \n79 Analysis of S&P Capital IQ Pro  TRS, earnings -per-share (EPS) , price -to-earnings ratio ( P/E), \nand P/B  data. This comparison  likely understates the incremental volatility introduced by the \npublicly traded IOU paradigm. ROE is for the parent companies , not the utility operating \ncompanies. Parents tend to have more leverage and/or own other businesses with more risk \nthan utilities, which would tend to increase the volatility of their ROEs  relative to their utility \nsubsidiaries.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n56 Figure 7. S&P 1500 Utilities Index TRS  and ROE  1 \n 2 \nPublicly traded parent companies’ additional volatility arises from two causes. First, the 3 \nparent does not distribute all of its utility income, but retains some to invest in potential 4 \nfuture growth, which is uncertain. Second, the discounted present value of that future growth 5 \nwill fluctuate with interest rate and overall market risk appetite.  This incremental risk raises 6 \nthe cost of equity directly, according to the risk -reward principle of finance, and indirectly by 7 \nreducing the supply of available capital.  8 \nUnder c ompetitive direct equity , investors would have direct exposure to the utility operating 9 \ncompany’s ROE, unmitigate d by the parent’s distribution decisions and the vicissitudes of the 10 \nstock market , dramatically reducing risk .80 Consequently,  the first benefit of  CDE ’s 11 \n \n80 [Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins   \n \n \n \n \n Section based on highly confidential trade secret \ninformation ends]  \n-20%-10%0%10%20%30%40%\nTRS\nROE\n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n57 investment risk reduction is an incrementally even lower cost of capital than what is reflected 1 \nin current markets. The ROR=COC standard alone would bring ROEs down to a certain 2 \nlevel, based on the risk of owning utility equity under the current paradigm of utility 3 \nownership. Competitive direct equity would further reduce ROEs.  4 \nQ. Where would the supply of low-cost capital come from?  5 \nA. I expect the initial investors would be private equity firms competing for many of the same 6 \nassets and opportunities as GIP and CPP – but with an important difference. GIP operates 7 \nunder  the traditional private equity model : buy a company, grow its earnings, resell  within a 8 \npre-specified holding period,  share in the profits . But not all private equity  is invest ed on 9 \nthese terms.  10 \nOther private equity investors, such as pension s, other retirement asset  managers , and 11 \nendowments, have a buy -and-hold approach and look for assets with long -term predictable 12 \nyields. Many of these long -term investors also have ESG, climate, energy transition, and 13 \nsimilar mandates  for which utilities are qualifying investments. In principle, utilities are ideal  14 \n– the proverbial “widows and orphans” safe and predictable investment. In practice, because 15 \nof the volatility introduced by parent company and public market intermediation, these 16 \ninvestors generally do not preferentially invest in utilities.81  17 \n \n81 For example, CalPERS ’s ownership of publicly traded utilities is roughly proportional to their \nshare of total public market capitalization.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n58 Q. Why are you confident investors will step up?  1 \nA. Prominent finance leaders expect the supply of such long-term, yield -seeking , infrastructure - 2 \nfocused private market capital  will increase rapidly over the coming decade s. For example, 3 \nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink ’s 2024 annual chairman’s letter to investors, title d “Time to 4 \nrethink retirement,” identifies retirement savings and infrastructure, energy in particular, as 5 \n“two of the mid -21st Century’s biggest economic challenges .” He proceeds to highlight the 6 \nrole of private capital in helping energy companies reduce costs  and GIP’s leadership in that 7 \narena.82 Marc Rowan, the CEO Apollo Global Management, whose Athene retirement 8 \nservices business manages approximately  $250 billion in assets, has expressed similar 9 \nviews.83 10 \nAs a retirement asset manager, Athene does not have the same  sale-proceeds -upside -sharing 11 \ncompensation structure as GIP ; their focus is risk -adjusted yield.84 And e ven if GIP’s current 12 \ntraditional private equity compensation model  isn’t well -suited for CDE, Mr. Fink’s letter 13 \nmakes it clear that BlackRock sees substantial opportunity in  aggregating and  investing 14 \nretirement assets in long -term, stable yield -producing  private  equity infrastructure.  15 \n \n82 BlackRock, Larry Fink’s 2024 Annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors , \nhttps://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor -relations/larry -fink-annual -chairmans -letter . \n83 See Apollo Investor Day 2024, \nhttps://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_6fc9e3739287543394941fa00b44dd27/apollo/db/2224/\n21725/pdf/Apollo+2024+Investor+Day+Presentation+.pdf . \n84 Private conversation with Apollo Global Management infrastructure investment team member. \nOn file with author.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n59 Q. Lower ris k directly reduces the cost of equity, which, by drawing in new supplies of 1 \ncapital, further reduces the cost. Are there o ther benefits?  2 \nA. Two other potential CO C-reducing benefit s are these alternative investors’ tax positions and 3 \nbalance sheets. Investors in public -traded IOU s face double taxation : the corporat ions’ 4 \nincome tax es and their own dividend taxes.  Direc t invest ment could potentially be structured 5 \nto reduce the tax burden , with some of the savings redound ing to consumers in the form of a 6 \nlower cost of equity . 7 \nBlackRock, Apollo, and other private capital firms invest across the capital structure, debt 8 \nand equity. In principle, they could provide the utility both debt and equity at a blended cost 9 \nof capital , managing  the capital structure internally . This would only be considered if it were 10 \nmutually beneficial  to investors and utility customers , but the potential opportunity merits 11 \ninvestigation.  12 \nIn addition to these incremental COC -reduction opportunities, there may also be some 13 \nbroader public interest benefits.  14 \nQ. Please elaborate.  15 \nA. Two come to mind. First,  to revisit the pool of capital  discussion. While Messrs. Fink and 16 \nRowan’s focus on retirement savings is self -serving, the underlying issue is of genuine public 17 \nconcern  and national interest . The migration over the last several decades away from defined - 18 \nbenefit pensions to defined -contribution IRAs and 401(k)s has left many Americans ill - 19 \nprepared for retirement. Utilities are one of the few businesses  that provide a long -term 20 \npredictable return profile better than bonds – ideal for retirement investors , if they could 21 \ninvest directly . Utilities  are also substantial, responsible  for hundreds of billions of dollars of 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n60 capital expenditure annually. Under the guidance of forward -thinking, public -spirited 1 \nregulators , utilities could play a pivotal role in addressing our nation’s retirement crisis.85 2 \nQ. And the second ? 3 \nA. A second category of public interest benefit s might be referred to as shareholder democracy  4 \nor democratic capitalism . Other potential private capital providers include public employee 5 \npension plans. The potential for these plans owning stakes , possibly sufficient to hold board 6 \nseats, might be intriguing to some.  7 \nA second potential shareholder democracy benefit is public ownership . Perhaps the biggest 8 \nbarrier to communities even consider ing public ownership is the exorbitant cost of buying 9 \nout the incumbent utility  – they have to pay the same type of unearned windfall GIP/CPP are 10 \noffering ALLETE.  The injustice of this predicament  is Kafkaesque: a community dissatisfied 11 \nwith their local utility due to its excessive profits must pay the  full value of those profits  up- 12 \nfront to get out from under them . No wonder only 20 utilities have been municipalized since 13 \n2000.86 CDE could allow communities to buy  in at book value and build their stake over 14 \ntime.87 15 \n \n85 National Council on Aging, Addressing the Nation’s  Retirement Crisis: The 80 %, Aug. 30, \n2024, https://www.ncoa.org/article/addressing -the-nations -retirement -crisis -the-80-percent -\nfinancially -struggling/ . \n86 Ursula Schryver & Barry Moline , Municipalization: setting the record straight , American \nPublic Power Association, Nov.  12, 2019 , https://www.publicpower.org/blog/municipalization -\nsetting -record -straight . \n87 The ROR=COC standard, by itself, would also eliminate this  hurdle.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n61 Q. A key democratic capitalism benefit of publicly traded utilities is that they are  1 \naccessible to individuals. Can CDE provide similar opportunities for individual 2 \ninvestors?  3 \nA. I expect CDE, once implemented, to quickly generate  compelling investment opportunities 4 \nfor individuals, comparable in liquidity and transaction cost to publicly traded equities, but 5 \nwith a more attractive risk -reward profile than products currently available.  6 \nOne of the most successful financial innovations  of the last half -century  is the exchange 7 \ntraded fund (ETF) , which assemble s a portfolio of assets  for sale to individual investors on 8 \npublic stock exchanges.  Because they are traded on exchanges, they are liquid and have low 9 \ntransaction costs . ETF management fees also are low, because several firms compete to 10 \nprovide them, including Vanguard, State Street, Invesco, Charles Schwab, and the largest, 11 \nBlackRock’s iShares .88 I envision ETF providers assembling portfolios of utility CDE stakes  12 \nfor sale to individual investors.  13 \nSuch ETFs might offer a unique ly attractive risk -reward profile. For example, if the utility 14 \ndistributes 100%  of CDE income and the CDE R OE is periodically reset to the prevailing 15 \nCOE, the market value of the  CDE stake should be relatively constant over time, with a 16 \nreturn inversely correlated with overall market risk appetite (or aversion) .89  17 \nThese are just a few examples of the types of democratic capitalism opportunities CDE might 18 \nengender.  All would require further investigation , development , and public deliberation . I  19 \n \n88 Matthew Johnston, 5 Biggest ETF Companies , Investopedia , May 15, 2024, \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/5 -biggest -etf-companies.asp . \n89 High market risk appetite pushes COE down while aversion pushes it  up. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n62 mention them not because I believe they are ready for implementation , but merely to point 1 \nout that CDE could unlock opportunities  that were previously foreclosed from consideration.  2 \n3. The Commission Can and Should Start  Straightaway.  3 \nQ. At what point in the regulatory process would this take place?  4 \nA. For MP, t he current sale to GIP/CPP should be aborted, for the numerous reasons I’ve 5 \nexplained. But the proposed sale of MP presents a unique opportunity to pilot CDE.  ALLETE 6 \nand MP have laid much of the dealmaking groundwork – engaging lawyers, investment 7 \nbankers, and other advisors; filling data rooms; and assembling transaction teams. These 8 \nefforts could lar gely be repurposed to a CDE process. Certainly, much additional work 9 \nremains, but the Commission should not allow ALLETE and MP’s efforts to date to go to 10 \nwaste.  11 \nMore  generally, the natural time for a utility to “go to market” for CDE would be toward the 12 \nend of a rate case, once the utility and regulator have agreed on a capex forecast . Instead of 13 \ndefaulting to the utility or its parent providing all incremental equity needs (through retained 14 \nearnings and/or additional equity), the utility would  solicit offers from multiple parties who 15 \ncompete on the basis of offered ROE. The ROE that clears this market process is, by 16 \ndefinition, the market -based COE.  17 \nQ. Would this process apply to the equity already invested in the utility?  18 \nA. Numerous CDE implementation details remain to be identified, explored, and resolved. I 19 \nexpect this would be among the most contentious.  A case could be made that the ROE that 20 \nclears the market for incremental equity reflects the market price and should apply to all 21 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n63 outstanding equity. Fortunately, regardless of how that issue is ultimately resolved , CDE 1 \nwould  still offer immediate direct customer and other benefits.  2 \nQ. What next steps  do you recommend to advance your CDE proposal ? 3 \nA. The next step would be to commission a study , convene  a technical  conference, and/ or open a 4 \nproceeding  to identify the issues and questions – legal, financial, regulatory, administrative, 5 \ntechnological, etc. – that would need to be investigated and addressed in implementing such a 6 \ncompetitive direct equity auction program.  I envision this quickly becoming a multi -state 7 \ninitiative , for two reasons : (1) t he problem, and therefore the potential benefits  of this 8 \nsolution , are common across all states ; and (2) investors and regulators share a common 9 \ninterest in standardized processes and investment terms across utilities and states  to facilitate 10 \nthe maximum participation  and efficiency.90 11 \nV. CONCLUSION  12 \nQ. Do you have any concluding comments?  13 \nThis transaction casts a spotlight on two critical, interconnected issues facing the 14 \nCommission, MP, and MP customers: the cost of meeting the CES, and the perverse 15 \nincentives created by excessive authorized ROEs. Excessive ROEs exacerbate CES cost 16 \nconcerns in two ways: they make the customer cost of all capital spending approximately 17 \n40% higher than it should be; and they create powerful incentives for MP to maximize its 18 \ncapital spending because that excess 40% redounds directly to MP’s owners. These higher 19 \n \n90 NARUC might seem an ideal candidate to play a coordinating role but probably isn’t. See \nfootnote 7878. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n64 customer costs also jeopardize the feasibility of meeting the CES. In short, the potential for a  1 \nMP customer tripe -whammy – higher rates, rising faster, for a possibly worse environmental 2 \noutcome. Addressing excessive ROEs provides a systematic and comprehensive solution to 3 \nboth of these pressing concerns.  4 \nQ.
