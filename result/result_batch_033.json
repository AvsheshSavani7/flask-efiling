    "content": "STATEMENTS\nCommissioner Christie’s Concurrence to\nGlobal Infrastructure Management-\nBlackRock Section 203 Order, EC24-58\nSeptember 06, 2024\nDocket No. EC24-58-000\nI concur in today’s order authorizing, under section 203 of the Federal Power Act, a\ntransaction in which BlackRock Funding, Inc., a newly created subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc.\n(BlackRock), will acquire all of the limited liability company interests in Global Infrastructure\nManagement, LLC (Transaction). \nI have long been concerned with huge asset managers, like BlackRock, seeking to acquire\ninterests in public utilities, especially in traditional load-serving entities (LSEs). [1]  The\ninfluence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the\nconsumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.  Such horizontal\nshareholdings pose the threat of decreased innovation, reduced competition, and\nultimately higher prices to consumers, as well as the prospect of chilling investment in\nexactly the new generation resources we need to meet increased demand for power and to\nenhance the reliability of the grid.  So this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny, as\nI have stated before. [2] \nFor purposes of this Transaction, I concur because it is consistent with Commission\nprecedent and policy and because BlackRock has previously received a section 203 blanket\nauthorization. [3]   BlackRock, pursuant to its blanket authorization, already holds interests\nin many LSEs as well as independent power producers (IPPs).  And in this Transaction, the\nother shoe drops:  BlackRock now seeks to acquire interests in even more IPPs, primarily in\nCalifornia, a relevant market in which it already holds extensive interests pursuant to its\nblanket authorization.  Of course, IPPs present the threat of competition to the generation\ntied to these other holdings, along with the generation BlackRock itself seeks to build. \nBlackRock is now firmly on both sides of the competition fence, as protestors here assert.\nBut, because of BlackRock’s blanket authorization, there is no further scrutiny.  Whether an\nentity with a blanket authorization is or will be on both sides of the fence should be front\nand center for serious scrutiny in any next steps taken on the Blanket Authorization Notice\nof Inquiry. You do not need a Ph.D. in economics to see the potential for anticompetitive\nconduct and outcomes when an investment entity like a huge asset manager seeks to ownCommissioner Christie’s Concurrence to Global Infrastructure Manage... https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/commissioner-christies-concur...\n1 of 3 1/31/25, 11:39 AM\nSchedule JB-2 \nBaker Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\ngeneration assets that will be — or should be — competitors.  Market power is an ever-\npresent concern, and one rule I taught my law students is that any seller with market power\nwill use it.  That’s not a moral judgment, just economic reality.   \nAnd, as I have also expressed previously, and which merits reiteration here, public utilities\nare not typical for-profit, shareholder-owned companies: \nIn particular, public utilities that provide electrical power to retail customers\nare usually holders of a state-granted monopoly franchise that comes with\nvarious public service obligations, such as providing reliable power service\nat rates that are just and reasonable.  So whether a public utility is owned by\ninvestors directly or through a holding company structure, it is absolutely\nessential for regulators to make sure that the interests of investors do not\nconflict with the public service obligations that a utility has.  And yes,\nthere  is a potential conflict.  That potential conflict requires heightened\nregulatory scrutiny when huge investment companies and asset managers,\nas well as large private equity funds, which individually and collectively\ndirect literally trillions of dollars in capital, appear to be acting not as\npassive investors simply seeking the best risk-based returns for their own\nclients, but instead appear to be  actively  using their investment power to\naﬀect how the utility meets its own public service obligations. [4]\nNot only does this potential conflict present problems from the consumer protection and\nreliability perspectives, but it also can produce structural changes to the very markets that\nthe Commission regulates, leading the Commission to fix and tweak rates and practices\nunder section 205, rather than preventing the concerning structural change from occurring\nin the first place.\nMore fundamentally, however, the concentration of horizontal shareholding in the entities\nregulated by the Commission causes less innovation, in a time where innovation is exactly\nwhat we need.  We need more  investment in the generation units that enhance reliability\nand reduce consumer prices, not less.  Cross-ownership creates the threat of the exercise of\nmarket power.  Market power, even through concentrated horizontal shareholding, deters\ninvestment; it does not encourage it.  And importantly, truly eﬀ ective regulation of\ntransactions aﬀ ecting public utilities does not result in a chilling of investment.  Investors\nwill always seek an adequate return, which good utility regulation recognizes.  And it is the\nCommission’s responsibility, indeed all utility regulators’ responsibility, to make sure that\nsuch money is not being needlessly extracted from consumers’ pockets through exercises of\nmarket power or other forms of rent-seeking. \nFor these reasons, I respectfully concur.Commissioner Christie’s Concurrence to Global Infrastructure Manage... https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/commissioner-christies-concur...\n2 of 3 1/31/25, 11:39 AM\nSchedule JB-2 \nBaker Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n______________________________\nMark C.

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION  1 \nQ. Please state your name, business address, and position.  2 \nA. My name is Mark Ellis. My business address is 8595 Nottingham Place, La Jolla, CA 92037. 3 \nI am a self -employed utility finance expert.  4 \nQ. Please summarize your education and professional experience.  5 \nA. I am a former utility executive now working as an independent consultant and testifying 6 \nexpert  in finance and economics in utility regulatory proceedings. I have over 30 years of 7 \nexperience in finance -related roles in the energy industry, including 15 years as the head of 8 \nstrategy for Sempra, now the 4th largest American utility company. Previously, I worked as a 9 \nconsultant in McKinsey’s energy practice, in international project development for 10 \nExxonMobil, and in industrial demand -side management for Southern California Edison. I 11 \nhave an M.S. from MIT’s Technology and Policy Program, where I focused on utility policy 12 \nand conducted research in the MIT Energy Lab, and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from 13 \nHarvard. Please s ee the attached statement of qualifications , Schedule ME -1, for additional 14 \ninformation about my  background . 15 \nQ. Have you previously testified before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission 16 \n(Commission  or MPUC )?  17 \nA. No. 18 \nQ. On whose behalf are you submitting testimony?  19 \nA. I am submitting testimony on behalf of CURE.  20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n5 Q. What is the purpose of your testimony in this proceeding?  1 \nA. The purpose of my testimony  is to contribute constructively to the record in order to assist 2 \nthe Commission in addressing several issues relevant to its dec ision in this case , the proposed 3 \nsale of Minnesota Power (MP), a regulated utility that is part of ALLETE, to Global 4 \nInfrastructure Partners (GIP) and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP).  My 5 \ntestimony will address the  following issues:  potential harms to the public interest from the 6 \nproposed transaction , particularly in relation to cost; overall consistency with the public 7 \ninterest; and impacts on MP ’s ability to comply with the Carbon -Free Energy Standard 8 \n(CES).1 I also discuss some potential regulatory requirements or commitments that could  9 \nrender the proposed transaction consistent with the public interest.  10 \nQ. Please summarize your  findings and  conclusions.  11 \nA. My testimony covers three topics I believe merit the Commission’s and the public’s attention 12 \nand consideration:  (1) the transaction’s  expected  adverse  impact on residential rate s and 13 \nimplications for the CES ; (2) how the proposed transaction proves, unequivocally, that MP’s 14 \nauthorized rate of return (ROR)  is excessive , and that excessive RO Rs are the key motivation 15 \nfor the transaction and the root cause of the forecast unprecedented rate increases ; and (3) 16 \ntwo proposed systemic solutions to problem of excessive ROEs, which are not unique to MP 17 \nor Minnesota.  18 \n \n1  Order Requiring Additional Information and Granting Intervention, and Notice of and Order \nfor Hearing, In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota  Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by  \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board and  Global Infrastructure Partners , PUC Docket No. \nE-015/PA -24-198, Oct. 7, 2024, p. 8,  available at  \nhttps://www.edockets.state.mn.us/documents/%7B50096892 -0000 -CC10 -87F7 -\n25B2F5169160%7D/download . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n6 The proposed transaction  would impose an  untenable economic burden on MP’s residential 1 \ncustomers . [Section based on highly confidential trade secret information  begins  2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n Section based on highly 6 \nconfidential trade secret information ends]  7 \nI also demonstrate how MP’s authorized RO R, by providing extraordinary returns on 8 \ninvestment  well above the statutorily  mandated cost of capital  (COC), creates perverse 9 \nincentives to maximize capital spendin g and is the root cause  of the proposed rate increases.  I 10 \nthen explain and demonstrate  how these already powerful financial incentives would be 11 \nexacerbated under GIP’ s ownership, due to its financial compensation structure  as a private 12 \nequity investment fund.  13 \nI then propose two solutions  to the  systemic  problem of excessive authorized RORs. The first 14 \nis standardiz ing and codify ing the process of calculating ROR and assigning responsibility 15 \nfor that analysis to the Commission . The second is to introduce competition for the provision 16 \nof equity directly to MP  (not ALLETE), with capital providers competing on the basis of 17 \nlowest offered  return , not highest offered price . These solutions would offer significant 18 \nbenefits, both immediately in the form of materially lower rates, and over the long term in 19 \nmitig ating, and potentially eliminating, the perverse incentive to maximize rate  base at 20 \ncustomer  expense . 21 \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n7 In conclusion, I recommend the Commission reject the transaction . Not because private 1 \nequity ownership of MP is not in the public interest, per se. Rather, proceeding with this 2 \ntransaction would obfuscate and exacerbate two critical issues that merit further 3 \ninvestigation , public engagement , and resolution : the cost to MP customers of meeting the 4 \nCES; and the Commission’s practice of authori zing excessive ROEs  and the perverse 5 \nincentives thereby created . The Commission should provide itself and stakeholders the time, 6 \ninformation, and opportunity required to do so.  7 \n[Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins  8 \n  9 \n 10 \n  11 \n Section based on highly confidential trade secret information ends]  12 \nQ. What are the implications of the proposed transaction for MP residential rates?  13 \nA.

EXCESSIVE AUTHORIZED ROE S AND THE TRADITIONAL PRIV ATE 4 \nEQUITY COMPENSATION STRUCTURE : A TOXIC COMBINATION  5 \nD. The Normative Standard for Setting Authorized ROEs Is Well -Established 6 \nand Universally Recognized.  7 \nQ. Before you were an independent consultant, you worked for Sempra.  In what business 8 \nactivities is Sempra engaged?  9 \nA. Sempra is probably best known as the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern 10 \nCalifornia Gas , its legacy utility businesses. Sempra also owns Oncor  (a Texas electric 11 \ndistribution utility ) and a portfolio of energy infrastructure assets in Mexico, and i s a leading 12 \ndeveloper of LNG export facilities in the US. Depending on the day’s market activity, 13 \nSempra alternates with AEP for the 4th and 5th largest US utility holding compan ies. 14 \nQ. You were Sempra’s Chief of Corporate Strategy and Chief Economist.  In those roles, 15 \ndid you work on transactions like the one under review in this proceeding?  16 \nA. Yes. Among my responsibilit ies at Sempra, I developed strategic and valuation frameworks 17 \nfor the company’s major initiatives – investments  (both greenfield and acquisitions ), 18 \ndivestments, policy positions  (e.g., on climate change) , and technology  selection.  I was also 19 \nresponsible for reviewing the financial model and economic case for major investments , and 20 \nfor the enterprise -wide cost of capital function , a critical input into nearly all forward -looking 21 \nfinancial analyses.  The expertise and insight I developed from that experience are directly 22 \nrelevant and applicable to the proposed transaction.  23 \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n15 Q. Do you have any other experience or expertise relevant to this proceeding?  1 \nA. Since leaving Sempra in 2019, I have been working as an expert witness in finance and 2 \neconomics in ut ility regulatory proceedings on behalf of consumer and environmental 3 \norganizations. I am also Senior Fellow  for Utilities at the American Economic Liberties 4 \nProject (AELP), an anti -monopoly think tank.  5 \nOne of my focus areas is utilities’ authorized  rate of return  (ROR) . I recently published a 6 \npaper (included with my testimony as Schedule ME -2) for AELP explai ning, to a policy - 7 \nmaker audience  ROR’s centrality to u tility profitability and decision -making.11 The paper  8 \ndiscusses  the legal principles , grounded in long -standing Supreme Court  precedent , that are 9 \nsupposed to guide regulators in setting a just a nd reasonable ROR : equal to the market -based 10 \ncost of capital , the “ROR=COC standard .” 11 \nQ. Which Supreme Court Cases established the ROR=COC standard?  12 \nA. The principle that rate of return should be set equal to the cost of capital  dates back to a 13 \nconcurring opinion penned by Supreme Court Justice Brandeis in 192312 and was formally 14 \nadopted by the full Court in its landmark 1944 Hope Natural Gas  decision.13 MP cost of 15 \ncapital witness Ann Bulkley’s Brattle Group colleague s, Lawrence Kolbe  and James Read , 16 \n \n11 Mark Ellis, Rate of Return Equals Cost  of Capital: A Simple, Fair Formula  to Stop Investor -\nOwned Utilities from  Overcharging  the Public , American Economic Liberties Project (Jan. \n2025), https://www.economicliberties.us/wp -content/uploads/2025/01/20250102 -aelp-ror-\nv5.pdf .

These include service on  the debt and dividends on the stock ... By 8 \nthat standard, the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns 9 \non investments in other enterprises having corresponding risk s.14 10 \nKolbe and Read  continue:  11 \nSince by definition the cost of capital of a regulated firm represents precisely the 12 \nexpected return that investors could anticipate from other investments while 13 \nbearing no more and no less risk, and since investors will not provide capital 14 \nunless the investment  is expected to yield its opportunity cost of capital, the 15 \ncorrespondence of the definition of the cost of capital  with the court’s definition 16 \nof legally required earnings appears clear. H ope refers to both “commensurate” 17 \nearnings and the attraction of capital. These two approaches are harmonized when 18 \nthe allowed rate of return is set equal to the cost of capital.15 19 \nIn short, “the return … commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having 20 \ncorresponding risks” is simply the “opportunity cost of capital .” 21 \nQ. Does the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission recognize the ROR=COC standard?  22 \nYes, and so does MP. As Ann E. Bulkley, MP’s cost of capital expert , explains,  citing 23 \nMinnesota Stat. § 216B.16, subd. 6,  “In determining just and reasonable rates, the 24 \nCommission is required to give due consideration to the utility’s cost of furnishing service  25 \nwhich includ es a fair reasonable return on investment .” She defines a fair and  reasonable 26 \n \n14 FPC v.

Quackenbush , in a report for the National 8 \nAssociation of Regulatory Utilit y Commissioners (NARUC ), of which Minnesota is a 9 \nmember18, summarizes the basis for the ROR=COC standard:  10 \n“Fundamental financial concepts demonstrate that the fair rate of return to use in 11 \nratemaking for a utility is its cost of capital in order to achieve the proper balance 12 \nbetween customers and investors .”19 13 \nFERC has similarly endorsed the ROR=COC standard:  14 \nThere is compelling economic justification for relying on the market cost of 15 \ncapital as the standard for rate of return decisions.

Utilities are entitled to recover only actual, prudently incurred costs. COSR is 10 \n“cost -of,” not “cost -plus.” 11 \nQ. Does your AELP paper cover any other issues pertinent to th e transaction under 12 \nconsideration in this  proceeding?  13 \nA. Yes. It provides compelling evidence that regulators have been in violation of this standard 14 \nfor decades, authorizing ROEs far above  utilities’ market -based COE . Excess ROEs  unjustly 15 \nbenefit utility shareholders  at a cost to their customers of approximately $50 billion per year. 16 \nThe paper concludes with several recommendations to address this long -standing and critical 17 \nproblem.  18 \n \n20 Ass’n of Bus.

Excessive Authorized ROE s Are a Perpetual  License for a Utility to  Pick Its 1 \nCustomer s’ Pocket s. 2 \nQ. What are the implications of excess authorized ROEs for understanding this 3 \ntransaction and assessing whether it is in the public interest?  4 \nA. Essentially, utilities raise capital at a relatively low cost – i.e., the cost of capital or expected 5 \nreturn22 – in financial markets and invest it in long -lived infrastructure  at a significantly 6 \nhigher return – the authorized rate of return.  We know this  is true because t he foundational 7 \nprinciple of finance  – discounted present value – tells us that an asset ’s value will equal the 8 \ncost of the initial investment if and only if its expected rate of return  is equal to  its risk- 9 \nadjusted cost of capital.  [Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins  10 \n 11 \n Section based on highly confidential trade secret information ends]  In a 12 \nprocess that can only be called financial alchemy, excess RORs turn every dollar of 13 \nshareholder capital invested by a utility operating company into a multiple – currently 14 \napproximately 2.2x – in shareholder market capitalization.23 15 \nThis premium , known as the price - or market -to-book ratio (P/B or M/B, respectively)  16 \nreflects the expected future wealth transfer from customers to utility shareholders  arising 17 \n \n22 See, e.g., Tim Koller, Marc Goedhart, and David Wessels, Valuation  (5th ed., Wiley, 2010), p. \n35 (“The cost of capital is the price charged by  investors for bearing the risk that the \ncompany’s future cash flows may differ from what they anticipate when they make the \ninvestment. The cost  of capital to a company equals the minimum return that investors expect \nto earn from investing in the company. That is why the terms expected return to investors  and \ncost of capital  are essentially the same. The cost of capital is also called the discount rate, \nbecause you discount future  cash flows at this rate when calculating the present value of an \ninvestment, to reflect what you will have to pay investors.”).  \n23 This reflects the S&P 1500 Util ities Index P/B as of January 17, 2025 .

The discrepancy between the authorized ROE and the market -based COE  is the sole and 8 \nentire justification for this transaction.  Essentially, ALLETE  is selling MP’s  exclusive 9 \npocket -picking franchise  to GIP/CPP for approximately $1.5 billion more than ALLETE  has 10 \ninvested in it.26 11 \n \n24 Mark Ellis, Rate of Return Equals Cost of Capital: A Simple, Fair Formula to Stop Investor -\nOwned Utilities from Overcharging the Public , American Economic Liberties Project, p.8 (Jan. \n2025), https://www.economicliberties.us/wp -content/uploads/2025/01/20250102 -aelp-ror-\nv5.pdf .

What have ALLETE  and its shareholders done to deserve this $1.5-billion premium to 1 \nthe cost of their investment ? 2 \nA. Nothing. It’s not compensation for past performance ; they have already been richly rewarded, 3 \nwith an ROE far in excess of the statutory COE standard, for their past oversight  and 4 \noperation of MP. It’s not compensation for future performance ; they are selling the business 5 \nso, by definition, they are no longer doing anything for which they deserve compensation.  6 \nG. ALLETE’S  Unearned Windfall Is a Regulatory Choice . 7 \nQ. So what does the $1.5 billion that GIP/CPP are offering ALLETE  shareholders on top 8 \nof their actual investment reflect?  9 \nA. ALLETE  shareholders ’ $1.5-billion windfall is purely and only an artifact of MP’s MPUC - 10 \ngranted p ocket -picking monopoly . They are paying up -front for the future value of the excess 11 \nprofits , arising from authorized ROEs greater than MP’s market -based COE, that GIP/CPP  12 \nexpect the Commission  to continue to allow MP to collect . 13 \nQ. That’s a strong claim. Please explain.  14 \nA. I’m going to use a simplified, but relatively accurate, mathematical description of the basic 15 \nutility financial model.  16 \nIf one were to look at GIP/CPP’s financial model for this transaction, they would quickly 17 \nbecome overwhelmed by its detail , size, and complexity. At root, though, utilit ies have a 18 \nsimple  business model : profit is a fixed fraction  (the ROE ) of invested capital , which grows 19 \nsteadily over time . Utility cash flow profile s are predictable and stable  and, therefore , 20 \nrelatively easy to value . As a result, f inance professionals and economists have  been able to 21 \ndevelop simple mathematical models that accurately capture the  inter-relationships between 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n22 the key economic levers of the utility business  model – ROE, COE,  book equity (i.e., the 1 \nequity portion of its rate base) , and growth  – and its market value . 2 \nOne such model that accurately captures the key value -drivers in this transaction is the  3 \nsustainable -growth discounted cash flow  model (SGDCF) , which expresses the relationshi ps 4 \nbetween the key economic levers as follows:  5 \nP/B = ROE (1 – b) / (COE – b ROE),  6 \nwhere b is the  plowback ratio , the share of annual profit that is reinvested in the utility to 7 \ngrow its book equity.27 The product of the plowback ratio and ROE  (b ROE) is the utility’s 8 \ngrowth rate , so as either b or ROE increase s, the growth rate increases as well.  9 \nFigure 3 shows how P/B changes as ROE increases  above COE (assumed constant here) , for 10 \ndifferent plowback ratios . Increasing plowback ratios,  starting from 0%, are represented by 11 \nlines of increasing thickness.  12 \nA few things to note. First, for any given plow back ratio, P/B increase s with ROE. This is 13 \njust common sense. ROE is profit per dollar of book value; higher profits are more valuable.  14 \nSecond , for any given ROE, P/B increases with plowback ratio , at an increasingly steeper 15 \nrate. A utility’ s value increases non -linearly with growth .28 One important implication is that, 16 \nif an investor can buy a utility at a P/B predicated on a certain plowback ratio and growth 17 \nrate, it can dramatically increase the value of its investment by increasing the growth rate.  18 \n 19 \n \n27 Myron J. Gordon, The Cost of Capital to a Public Utility , MSU Public Utility Studies, p. 27-\n30 (1974) . All other terms are as described previously.  \n28 While  not directly observable in the chart, for any given ROE and COE, P/B increases at a rate \nfaster than exponential with growth ( b x ROE).  \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n23 Finally, when ROE is equal to COE, P/B is equal to 1.0, regardless of the plowback ratio or 1 \ngrowth rate . This is consistent with the present value principle of finance; if a utility is just 2 \nearning its cost of equity – which is the legal standard – its P/B should equal 1.0 . This is true 3 \nregardless of the growth rate.  4 \nFigure 3. Sustainable -growth DCF model illustrating the relationship between utility ROE, 5 \nCOE, and P/B  6 \n 7 \nH. GIP/CPP Can Justify Its $1.5 -Billion  Premium Only by Dramatically 8 \nAccelerating MP’s Rate Base Growth . 9 \nQ. How can GIP /CPP pay such a large premium and still meet their investors’ return 10 \nexpectations?  11 \nA. Prior to the transaction, ALLETE ’s share price indicated that MP’s market value exceeded  its 12 \nbook value, i.e., investors expected MP’s ROE to exceed its COE.29 GIP/CPP are paying a 13 \n \n29 ALLETE, Merger Proposed - Notice of a Special Meeting - Proxy Information, July 10,  2024,  \nhttps://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/018522/20240701/NO MP_581536.PDF . \nP/B=1.0ROE=COE\nP/B\nROEb(and g)\n= 0%\nIncreasing b\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n24 substantial premium over ALLETE ’s pre -transaction market  value.30 The only way GIP/CPP 1 \ncan justify this premium is if they expect  to increase MP’s ROE and/or growth above what 2 \nALLETE ’s investors expected prior to the transaction.  3 \nLike other private equity firms, GIP and CPP have made commitments to their  investors to 4 \nmeet certain return target s. In addit ion, private equity firms typically have performance -based  5 \ncompensation plans that offer employee s financial incentives linked to  the increase in value 6 \nof the assets they acquire.31 GIP/CPP  and their fund managers have powerful  organizational 7 \nand personal incentives to increase the value of MP . 8 \nI. The Traditional Private Equity Compensation Structure E ncourage s 9 \nGIP/CPP to Dig Ever Deeper Into MP Customer Pockets . 10 \nQ. How will GIP/CPP increase the value of MP?  11 \nA. As the SGDCF illustrates, GIP/CPP  basically have two levers for increasing the value of MP: 12 \nexpanding  ROE and growing rate base.

Two Unambiguous Facts  About the Proposed Sale of MP Pr ove 3 \nUnequivocal ly That MP’s ROE Is Excessive . 4 \nQ. You’ve gone into a lot of technical detail on ROR, COC, and PV . Can you summarize 5 \nthe key findings and conclusions?  6 \nThere are two unambiguous, undeniable facts staring us in the face in th is transaction: (1) 7 \nALLETE shareholders would walk away with a $1.5 -billion gain on the  actual  cost of their 8 \ninvestment in MP; and (2) GIP/CPP are willing to pay this premium only because they expect 9 \nit to be profitable, i.e., meet or exceed their expected investment return target s. The purpose 10 \nof the a ll the analysis is to prove, in the most irrefutable  way possible by invoking only the 11 \nmost fundamental principle of finance – discounted present value – that these two facts can 12 \nbe true if and only if MP’s current and expected future authorized ROE far exceeds its COE.  13 \nThis transaction makes crystal clear what seems to elude this Commission and other 14 \nregulators among the flurry of competing theories, methodologies, models, assumptions, and 15 \nresults in the typical rate of return process: authorized ROEs are systematically too high, 16 \nhave been for decades, and investors in both the public and private capital markets expect 17 \nthem to continue into perpetuity.  18 \nThis transaction presents the Commission and the broader Minnesota public an opportunity 19 \nto confront th e problem of excessive RORs and do something about it. The alternative is to 20 \ncontinue  to allow MP and its IOU peers to continue to pick the pockets of their unwitting 21 \ncustomers, forever.  22 \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n43 growth rate . When equity is raised, investors get only their expected return. Because 1 \ninvestors  gain nothing from merely growing rate base, they have no incentive to do so for its 2 \nown sake, but only as needed to ensure safe and reliable service in compliance with all 3 \napplicable laws and regulations.  4 \nThird, setting ROR equal to COC minimizes the cost of the investment that is needed. 5 \nRecovering only actual  capital costs in rates – depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, 6 \nand net income – [Section based on highly confidential trade secret information begins   7 \n Section 8 \nbased on highly confidential trade secret information ends]  9 \nFourth, as the Regulatory Assistance Project has documented, excessive ROEs crowd out the 10 \nincentive effects of performance -based ratemaking: any reasonable performance award is 11 \ndwarfed by the value created just by growing rate base.63 I witnessed this first -hand at 12 \nSempra.

Just a Few Straightforward, Practical Policies Can Ensure Compliance 1 \nWith the ROR=COC Standard . 2 \nQ. What do es your first proposed solution entail ? 3 \nA. I envision several steps.  First, clarify in regulation or, if necessary, legislation, that  (1) 4 \n“authorized rate of return ” and “cost of capital ” are two distinct  concepts ; and (2) that the 5 \nauthorized rate of return must  be set equal to the market -based cost of capital.  6 \nQ. Why is the clarification of ROR and COC necessary?  7 \nCurrently, t he two terms  are frequently used interchangeably – for example, in MP’s required 8 \nGRC filing, “ Schedule D -1: Rate of Return / Cost of Capital .”64 Utility ROR experts have 9 \nexploit ed this confusion to promulgate a nd propagate  a classic is -ought fallacy : because ROR 10 \nis supposed to be  equal to COC, it is equal to COC. For example, they have successfully 11 \nintroduced analyses  that reference only other authorized ROEs – the FERC -banned risk 12 \npremium and expected earnings models65 – without  even a pretense of estimating a market - 13 \nbased cost of capital.  To its  credit , this Commission recognizes the flaws with these models 14 \nand has rejected their results.66 15 \n \n64 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority  to Increase Electric Service \nRates in Minnesota , PUC Docket  No. E015/GR -23-155, p. 67, eDockets No. 202311 -200092 -\n10. \n65 Zack Hale, DC Circuit ruling gives FERC new chance to establish durable transmission \nROEs , S&P Global, Aug. 12, 2022 , https://www.spglobal.com/market -intelligence/en/news -\ninsights/articles/2022/8/dc -circuit -ruling -gives -ferc-new-chance -to-establish -durable -\ntransmission -roes-71694369 . \n66  Findings of Fact, Conclusions, and Order, In the Matter of the Application of Northern  States \nPower Company, dba Xcel Energy, for  Authority to Increase Rates for Electric  Service in the \nState of Minnesota , MPUC Docket No. E-002/GR -21-630, p. 89 , July 17, 2023 , \nhttps://www.edockets.state.mn.us/documents/%7BC0236589 -0000 -C115 -A5A9 -\nE96843D1FFF6%7D/download?contentSequence=0&rowIndex=58 . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n45 The confusion and lack of clarity between ROR and COC, and utilities’ exploitation of them , 1 \nseems to have facilitated the decades -long slide into our current situation, where not a single 2 \njurisdiction in the entire country is in compliance with the SCOTUS ROR=COC standard.  3 \nQ. What is your second step  to ensure compliance with the ROR=COC standard ? 4 \nA. Second, standardize and codify the process for calculating COC. Utilities frequently assert 5 \nthat COC  is “more art than science.” Under this pretext,  utility ROR experts have , over the 6 \nlast several decades,  introduced a variety of methodologies, models, and assumptions that 7 \nlack any empirical or theoretical basis and often “def[y] general financial logic,” as FERC 8 \ndescribed one commonly used model.67 Following FERC’s lead, such approaches should be 9 \nbanned outright.  10 \nQ. Do you agree?  11 \nA. I strongly disagree. Cost of capital is a topic in which I have decades of real -world practical 12 \nexperience as well as deep and nuanced technical understanding. I researched, designed, 13 \nimplemented, and oversaw the cost of capital function for one of the largest US utility 14 \nholding companies with an unusually diverse portfolio of businesses. Sempra relied on the 15 \nprocess I created in making multi -billion -dollar investment decisions.  16 \nBut Sempra is not unique. Virtually every company that invests in long -lived assets must 17 \ncalculate a cost of capital. Given its importance, it is one of the most thoroughly researched 18 \nareas of finance.

They are simple 1 \n– typically taught in introductory finance courses – the necessary input data are widely 2 \navailable , and , properly implemented, they produce consistent results . As demonstrated  in my 3 \nAELP paper, there is remarkable consensus about what the market -based cost of equity is.68 4 \nQ. What is the third step to ensure compliance with the ROR=COC standard?  5 \nA. Third, o nce codified, responsibility for calculating COC should rest with the Commission  6 \n(subject to appeal), not utilities. The Commission  is much better positioned to maintain and 7 \nensure  quality, transparency, consistency , and objectivity  across the utilities in its jurisdiction.  8 \nStandardizing , codifying , and managing  a transparent , rigorous,  and replicable process for 9 \ncalculating COC would be a very modest undertaking for a regulator.69 I know, because I did 10 \nit at Sempra.  It would also dramatically reduce the time, cost, effort , and angst  involved  11 \nrelative to the “dueling experts” status quo.

Their customer satisfaction, reliability, and environmental  performance are 2 \ncomparable to IOUs.71 They operate on a true cost -of-service model, with no mark -up on 3 \ntheir financing costs  akin to IOUs’ excess ROEs. They manage to keep the lights on without 4 \nany financial alchemy. There’s no reason IOUs can’t as well.  5 \nQ. POUs rely on debt, an d their cost of capital is set in markets – either the bond market 6 \nor among competing banks and other lenders – that provide a directly observable 7 \nnumber.  For IOUs’ cost of equity, even if we enforce the ROR=COC standard, won’t we 8 \nstill have to rely on regulators to estimate the market -based cost of capital ? 9 \nA. Yes, that is a challenge.  I have two things to say about that.  First, we shouldn’t let the perfect 10 \nbe the enemy of the good. The evidence that authorized ROEs far exceed the market -based 11 \nCOE is overwhelming and compelling, with th is transaction serving as a particularly 12 \npoignant example.  Regulators can confidently reduce ROEs to approximately 6% 13 \nimmediately.  From there, utility price -to-book ratios can, in the words of  Kolbe  and Read , 14 \nMP COC  expert Bulkley’s Brattle Group colleague s, be used “as a guide for regulators,” 15 \nadjusting ROEs until P/B approaches 1.0.72 16 \nQ. What is your second  point about continuing to rely on regulators to set ROR?  17 \nA. My second thought  is that the potential to leverage markets to provide an unambiguous, 18 \nobservable cost of equity for utilities has never been explored and, therefore, never been 19 \n \n71 See American Customer Satisfaction Index, Energy Utilities, \nhttps://theacsi.org/industries/energy -utilities/ ; and American Public Power Association, 2024 \nPublic Power Statistical Report, https://www.publicpower.org/system/files/documents/2024 -\nPublic -Power -Statistical -Report.pdf . \n72 Kolbe et al., The Cost of Capital: Estimating the Rate of Return for Public Utilities , p. 25  \n(1984 ). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n48 implemented. The existing utility regulat ory paradigm –an equity  (but not for debt) financing 1 \nmonopoly inextricably attached to the “natural” operating monopoly, with the return set by 2 \nregulatory fiat  – dates back over 100 years. In that time, f inancial markets have become 3 \nunrecognizably sophisticated and liquid  and can aggregate, segregate, and accurately price 4 \nrisk in an infinite number of ways , with no better example than the transaction under 5 \nconsideration in this proceeding.  6 \nCreating a market mechanism that provides an unambiguous, transparent, and competitively 7 \ndetermined utility cost of equity would be relatively straightforward . It would also unlock 8 \nlarge pools of low -cost, patient capital currently sidelined from the utility sector by 9 \nunnecessary risks and costs that are not inherent to utilities’ underlying business, but are 10 \npurely artifacts of the dominant financing paradigm adopted by regulators.  11 \nI will discuss this potential solution to the challenge of regulating the return on equity later in 12 \nmy testimony.  13 \nQ. Wouldn’t reducing ROEs adversely impact utility stock prices?  14 \nA. Yes. Utility stock s would trade down, but as the Supreme Court established  in Hope , 15 \nregulators are not obligated to maintain utility stock valuations , and that  such an obligation 16 \nwould make a nonsense of regulators’ consumer protection  mandate : 17 \nRate-making is indeed but one species of price -fixing. . . . The fixing of prices, 18 \nlike other applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property 19 \nwhich is being regulated. But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean that 20 \nthe regulation is invalid. . . . It does, however, indicate that “fair value” is the end 21 \nproduct of the process of ratemaking, not the starting point , as the Circuit Court 22 \nof Appeals held. The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n49 upon “fair value” when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings 1 \nunder whatever rates may be anticipated .73 2 \nQ. Wouldn’t reducing MP’s ROE adversely affect MP’s and ALLETE ’s credit and ability 3 \nto raise capital?  4 \nA. I discuss this potential concern in the AELP paper described above74 and in testimony I 5 \nsubmitted in 2024 in a rate of return proceeding in California , which I am including with this 6 \ntestimony as Exhibit MEE -3.75 This argument, widely invoked by utilities to justify excessive 7 \nROEs, is a red herring, for two reasons.  8 \nFirst, the impact on a utility’s credit rating and cost of debt from even a sharp reduction in 9 \nROE is far less than utilities’ fear -mongering  would have us believe. This is because ROE 10 \naccounts for only about half of the cash flow used to assess a utility’s credit quality.  11 \nSecond, and more importantly, any potential erosion in credit quality can be easily 12 \ncounteracted with a modest increase in equity ratio. A higher equity ratio would partially 13 \noffset the customer savings of a lower  ROE, but the trade -off is not one -for-one. ROE, utility 14 \nprofits, and, as a result, customer rates, can all be reduced substantially without any adverse 15 \nimpact on a utility’s credit quality or ability to raise capital.  16 \n \n73 Fed.

Let Real  Competition , Not a Surrogate,  Set ROR.  1 \n1. Let Investors Bid Down RO E to a Transparent, Market -based  COE  2 \n(Instead of Bidding Up Utility Stock Prices ). 3 \nQ. You mentioned you have two proposed solutions for MP’s financial challenges. What is 4 \nyour second proposal ? 5 \nA. A long -standing regulatory principle maintains that “regulation is a surrogate for 6 \ncompetition,”76 implying that, where competition is possible, it is preferred. My second 7 \nproposal  is simply to honor that principle : sever the bond between  the utility’s  monopoly on 8 \nthe provision of equity capital, which is not a natural monopoly, from i ts operating 9 \nmonopoly, which is , and allow capital providers to compete  to provide equity  directly to the 10 \nutility operating company (not the parent) , based on offered ROE . 11 \nThe current approach essentially has investors bid up the price  of the monopoly pocket - 12 \npicking machine to a level commensurate with their desired expected return. This is what 13 \nequity markets , like that for publicly traded shares,  do. It is also w hat ALLETE has done in 14 \nthis transaction, potentially yielding a $1.5 -billion unearned windfall . 15 \nInstead, the proposal borrow s from how debt markets work : have investors bid down the 16 \nreturn  at which they’d be willing to provide equity.  I call it “competitive direct equity”  17 \n(CDE).  18 \n \n76 Dennis L.

Isn’t the “bid up the price” model – often well above book value – how other equity 1 \nissuances work, like IPOs and venture capital? Why should utilities be treated 2 \ndifferently?  3 \nA. Yes, venture capital and IPOs essentially bid up the price of the underlying asset until the 4 \nimplied expected return equals investors’ opportunity cost of capital. But there’s an important 5 \ndistinction between utilities and typical IPOs and VC. In the latter, new investors are willing 6 \nto pay more than book value because the new investors believe the existing owners offer a 7 \nproduct or service whose value is determined in a competitive  market  of some sort. The 8 \ncompany could have created a new product for an existing market (e.g., Tesla) or an entirely 9 \nnew industry (e.g., Uber, OpenAI), expanded supply in an existing market (e.g., new oil 10 \nwells), or just own a scarce resource (e.g., developable beachfront property). The difference 11 \nbetween what new investors are willing to pay and what the existing owners have invested is 12 \na reflection of the value created in the market of goods and services through the existing 13 \nowners’ ingenuity and risk -taking.  14 \nQ. How are utilities  different than these companies ? 15 \nA. For utilities, in contrast, the difference between what new investors are willing to pay and 16 \nwhat the existing owners have invested is a reflection solely of a regulatory decision , as 17 \nrecognized in Hope : “the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever 18 \nrates may be anticipated .”77 The equity market for utilities is not like the market for the 19 \nequity of other companies, because the value of the equity is determined by regulatory fiat, 20 \nnot by any value created by the existing owners in the market of goods and service  through 21 \ntheir ingenuity and risk -taking . 22 \n \n77 Fed. Power Comm’n v. Hope Nat. Gas Co ., 320 U.S. 591, 601 (1944) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n52 Q. But utilities are innovative and take risks. For example, they deploy new technologies 1 \nand develop  and implement  innovative policies.  2 \nUtilities can be innovative, but the key difference is that they don’t take risk in their 3 \ninnovation. The costs of investigating and deploying new technologies are recoverable in 4 \nrates, as are the salaries of the people developing and implementing new policies.  Cost-of- 5 \nservice regulation protects utilities from most of the risks faced by companies not subject to 6 \nit. To the extent utilities have residual risk, like operational risk, it is reflected in their market - 7 \nbased cost of capital  and is adequately compensated by the ROR=COC standard . 8 \nIn short, the equity markets for other companies reward the things we want markets to 9 \nreward: efficiency, innovation, quality, service, value. In contrast, the market for utility 10 \nequity mostly rewards regulatory capture,78 something we should seek to avoid or at least 11 \nminimize.  12 \nQ. Why would this produce lower ROEs  than the current process of having regulators set 13 \nROEs?  14 \nA. Investors betray through their behavior that they are willing to accept an expected return 15 \nlower than the authorized ROE. Under the present value principle, and as demonstrated in 16 \nFigure 5, if investors are willing to pay more than book value, it must be the case, 17 \nmathematically, that their expected return , i.e., the market -based COE,  is lower than 18 \nauthorized ROE s. 19 \n \n78 If one questions how deeply entrenched  regulatory capture is in the U.S., to the point of blasé \nexpectation, just look at the lead sponsor of NARUC’s annual conference: the Edison Electric \nInstitute, the utilities’ largest and most influential trade association, shamelessly displayed at \nthe top  of the page. NARUC appears not to care about maintaining even a patina of propriety \nand impartiality. See NARUC, Annual Meeting, https://www.naruc.org/annual -meeting/  (last \nvisited Feb. 4, 2025).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n53 Q. Wouldn’t your first proposal – standardizing and codifying the calculation of COC – 1 \nproduce the same result?  2 \nA. By implement ing my first proposed solution , regulators could come much closer than they 3 \nare today to setting returns equal to the market -based cost  of capital. None theless, t hey would 4 \nstill need to rely on models and market feedback , like Kolbe  and Read ’s P/B “guide to 5 \nregulators ,” not a transparent, unambiguous number like a bond interest rate , so the ROR 6 \nwould never be exactly equal to COC . But the benefits of competitive direct equity go far 7 \nbeyond just accuracy.  8 \n2. Competitive Direct Equity  Offers Numerous Other Benefits.  9 \nQ. What are the additional benefits  of competitive direct equity?  10 \nA. The benefit s of competitive direct equity stem primarily from its reduction of investment 11 \nrisk. The current  utility ownership paradigm  – operating companies owned  by publicly traded 12 \nparent companies  – introduces unnecessary and undesirable investment risk into what is 13 \nfundamentally a low-risk business.  Figure 7 compares the total return to shareholders (TRS ; 14 \ndividends plus capital gains ) to the  realized trailing -twelve -month ROE for the S&P 1500 15 \nUtilities Index.  TRS is eight times more volatile than ROE.79 16 \n \n79 Analysis of S&P Capital IQ Pro  TRS, earnings -per-share (EPS) , price -to-earnings ratio ( P/E), \nand P/B  data. This comparison  likely understates the incremental volatility introduced by the \npublicly traded IOU paradigm. ROE is for the parent companies , not the utility operating \ncompanies. Parents tend to have more leverage and/or own other businesses with more risk \nthan utilities, which would tend to increase the volatility of their ROEs  relative to their utility \nsubsidiaries.  \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n55 investment risk reduction is an incrementally even lower cost of capital than what is reflected 1 \nin current markets. The ROR=COC standard alone would bring ROEs down to a certain 2 \nlevel, based on the risk of owning utility equity under the current paradigm of utility 3 \nownership. Competitive direct equity would further reduce ROEs.  4 \nQ. Where would the supply of low-cost capital come from?  5 \nA. I expect the initial investors would be private equity firms competing for many of the same 6 \nassets and opportunities as GIP and CPP – but with an important difference. GIP operates 7 \nunder  the traditional private equity model : buy a company, grow its earnings, resell  within a 8 \npre-specified holding period,  share in the profits . But not all private equity  is invest ed on 9 \nthese terms.  10 \nOther private equity investors, such as pension s, other retirement asset  managers , and 11 \nendowments, have a buy -and-hold approach and look for assets with long -term predictable 12 \nyields. Many of these long -term investors also have ESG, climate, energy transition, and 13 \nsimilar mandates  for which utilities are qualifying investments. In principle, utilities are ideal  14 \n– the proverbial “widows and orphans” safe and predictable investment. In practice, because 15 \nof the volatility introduced by parent company and public market intermediation, these 16 \ninvestors generally do not preferentially invest in utilities.81 17 \nQ. Why are you confident investors will step up?  18 \nA. Prominent finance leaders expect the supply of such long-term, yield -seeking , infrastructure - 19 \nfocused private market capital  will increase rapidly over the coming decade s. For example, 20 \n \n81 For example, CalPERS ’s ownership of publicly traded utilities is roughly proportional to their \nshare of total public market capitalization.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n56 BlackRock CEO Larry Fink ’s 2024 annual chairman’s letter to investors, title d “Time to 1 \nrethink retirement,” identifies retirement savings and infrastructure, energy in particular, as 2 \n“two of the mid -21st Century’s biggest economic challenges .” He proceeds to highlight the 3 \nrole of private capital in helping energy companies reduce costs  and GIP’s leadership in that 4 \narena.82 Marc Rowan, the CEO Apollo Global Management, whose Athene retirement 5 \nservices business manages approximately  $250 billion in assets, has expressed similar 6 \nviews.83 7 \nAs a retirement asset manager, Athene does not have the same  sale-proceeds -upside -sharing 8 \ncompensation structure as GIP ; their focus is risk -adjusted yield.84 And e ven if GIP’s current 9 \ntraditional private equity compensation model  isn’t well -suited for CDE, Mr. Fink’s letter 10 \nmakes it clear that BlackRock sees substantial opportunity in  aggregating and  investing 11 \nretirement assets in long -term, stable yield -producing  private  equity infrastructure.  12 \nQ. Lower ris k directly reduces the cost of equity, which, by drawing in new supplies of 13 \ncapital, further reduces the cost. Are there o ther benefits?  14 \nA.

Please elaborate.  10 \nA. Two come to mind. First,  to revisit the pool of capital  discussion. While Messrs. Fink and 11 \nRowan’s focus on retirement savings is self -serving, the underlying issue is of genuine public 12 \nconcern  and national interest . The migration over the last several decades away from defined - 13 \nbenefit pensions to defined -contribution IRAs and 401(k)s has left many Americans ill - 14 \nprepared for retirement. Utilities are one of the few businesses  that provide a long -term 15 \npredictable return profile better than bonds – ideal for retirement investors , if they could 16 \ninvest directly . Utilities  are also substantial, responsible  for hundreds of billions of dollars of 17 \ncapital expenditure annually. Under the guidance of forward -thinking, public -spirited 18 \nregulators , utilities could play a pivotal role in addressing our nation’s retirement crisis.85 19 \n \n85 National Council on Aging, Addressing the Nation’s  Retirement Crisis: The 80 %, Aug. 30, \n2024, https://www.ncoa.org/article/addressing -the-nations -retirement -crisis -the-80-percent -\nfinancially -struggling/ . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n58 Q. And the second ? 1 \nA. A second category of public interest benefit s might be referred to as shareholder democracy  2 \nor democratic capitalism . Other potential private capital providers include public employee 3 \npension plans. The potential for these plans owning stakes , possibly sufficient to hold board 4 \nseats, might be intriguing to some.  5 \nA second potential shareholder democracy benefit is public ownership . Perhaps the biggest 6 \nbarrier to communities even consider ing public ownership is the exorbitant cost of buying 7 \nout the incumbent utility  – they have to pay the same type of unearned windfall GIP/CPP are 8 \noffering ALLETE.  The injustice of this predicament  is Kafkaesque: a community dissatisfied 9 \nwith their local utility due to its excessive profits must pay the  full value of those profits  up- 10 \nfront to get out from under them . No wonder only 20 utilities have been municipalized since 11 \n2000.86 CDE could allow communities to buy  in at book value and build their stake over 12 \ntime.87 13 \nQ. A key democratic capitalism benefit of publicly traded utilities is that they are  14 \naccessible to individuals. Can CDE provide similar opportunities for individual 15 \ninvestors?  16 \nA. I expect CDE, once implemented, to quickly generate  compelling investment opportunities 17 \nfor individuals, comparable in liquidity and transaction cost to publicly traded equities, but 18 \nwith a more attractive risk -reward profile than products currently available.  19 \n \n86 Ursula Schryver & Barry Moline , Municipalization: setting the record straight , American \nPublic Power Association, Nov.  12, 2019 , https://www.publicpower.org/blog/municipalization -\nsetting -record -straight . \n87 The ROR=COC standard, by itself, would also eliminate this  hurdle.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n59 One of the most successful financial innovations  of the last half -century  is the exchange 1 \ntraded fund (ETF) , which assemble s a portfolio of assets  for sale to individual investors on 2 \npublic stock exchanges.  Because they are traded on exchanges, they are liquid and have low 3 \ntransaction costs . ETF management fees also are low, because several firms compete to 4 \nprovide them, including Vanguard, State Street, Invesco, Charles Schwab, and the largest, 5 \nBlackRock’s iShares .88 I envision ETF providers assembling portfolios of utility CDE stakes  6 \nfor sale to individual investors.  7 \nSuch ETFs might offer a unique ly attractive risk -reward profile. For example, if the utility 8 \ndistributes 100%  of CDE income and the CDE R OE is periodically reset to the prevailing 9 \nCOE, the market value of the  CDE stake should be relatively constant over time, with a 10 \nreturn inversely correlated with overall market risk appetite (or aversion) .89  11 \nThese are just a few examples of the types of democratic capitalism opportunities CDE might 12 \nengender.  All would require further investigation , development , and public deliberation . I 13 \nmention them not because I believe they are ready for implementation , but merely to point 14 \nout that CDE could unlock opportunities  that were previously foreclosed from consideration.  15 \n3. The Commission Can and Should Start  Straightaway.  16 \nQ. At what point in the regulatory process would this take place?  17 \nA. For MP, t he current sale to GIP/CPP should be aborted, for the numerous reasons I’ve 18 \nexplained. But the proposed sale of MP presents a unique opportunity to pilot CDE.  ALLETE 19 \nand MP have laid much of the dealmaking groundwork – engaging lawyers, investment 20 \n \n88 Matthew Johnston, 5 Biggest ETF Companies , Investopedia , May 15, 2024, \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/5 -biggest -etf-companies.asp . \n89 High market risk appetite pushes COE down  while  aversion  pushes it  up. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n60 bankers, and other advisors; filling data rooms; and assembling transaction teams. These 1 \nefforts could lar gely be repurposed to a CDE process. Certainly, much additional work 2 \nremains, but the Commission should not allow ALLETE and MP’s efforts to date to go to 3 \nwaste.  4 \nMore  generally, the natural time for a utility to “go to market” for CDE would be toward the 5 \nend of a rate case, once the utility and regulator have agreed on a capex forecast . Instead of 6 \ndefaulting to the utility or its parent providing all incremental equity needs (through retained 7 \nearnings and/or additional equity), the utility would  solicit offers from multiple parties who 8 \ncompete on the basis of offered ROE. The ROE that clears this market process is, by 9 \ndefinition, the market -based COE.  10 \nQ. Would this process apply to the equity already invested in the utility?  11 \nA. Numerous CDE implementation details remain to be identified, explored, and resolved. I 12 \nexpect this would be among the most contentious.  A case could be made that the ROE that 13 \nclears the market for incremental equity reflects the market price and should apply to all 14 \noutstanding equity. Fortunately, regardless of how that issue is ultimately resolved , CDE 15 \nwould  still offer immediate direct customer and other benefits.  16 \nQ. What next steps  do you recommend to advance your CDE proposal ? 17 \nA. The next step would be to commission a study , convene  a technical  conference, and/ or open a 18 \nproceeding  to identify the issues and questions – legal, financial, regulatory, administrative, 19 \ntechnological, etc. – that would need to be investigated and addressed in implementing such a 20 \ncompetitive direct equity auction program.  I envision this quickly becoming a multi -state 21 \ninitiative , for two reasons : (1) t he problem, and therefore the potential benefits  of this 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –   PUC Docket No. E0/15PA -24-198 \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN    and E015/M -24-383 \nEXCISED  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \n CURE Exhibit __________  \n  \n61 solution , are common across all states ; and (2) investors and regulators share a common 1 \ninterest in standardized processes and investment terms across utilities and states  to facilitate 2 \nthe maximum participation  and efficiency.90 3 \nV. CONCLUSION  4 \nQ. Do you have any concluding comments?  5 \nThis transaction casts a spotlight on two critical, interconnected issues facing the 6 \nCommission, MP, and MP customers: the cost of meeting the CES, and the perverse 7 \nincentives created by excessive authorized ROEs. Excessive ROEs exacerbate CES cost 8 \nconcerns in two ways: they make the customer cost of all capital spending approximately 9 \n40% higher than it should be; and they create powerful incentives for MP to maximize its 10 \ncapital spending because that excess 40% redounds directly to MP’s owners. These higher 11 \ncustomer costs also jeopardize the feasibility of meeting the CES. In short, the potential for a 12 \nMP customer tripe -whammy – higher rates, rising faster, for a possibly worse environmental 13 \noutcome. Addressing excessive ROEs provides a systematic and comprehensive solution to 14 \nboth of these pressing concerns.  15 \nQ. Have all of your opinions expressed herein been provided to a reasonable degree of 16 \neconomic professional certainty and been informed by your education, training, 17 \nbackground, and experience?  18 \nA. Yes. 19 \n \n90 NARUC might seem an ideal candidate to play a coordinating role but probably isn’t.

    "content": "RATE OF RETURN \nEQUALS COST OF CAPITAL: \nA Simple, Fair Formula to Stop Investor-Owned Utilities From  Overcharging the Public\nMark Ellis\nJanuary 2025\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n2 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTINTRODUCTION \nThe American utility market is based on a social contract. The government sanctions private, for-\nprofit monopolies to provide approximately 70% of electricity and 95% of natural gas deliveries in the United States.\n1 In return, these private monopolies, called investor-owned utilities (IOUs), \nagree to provide universal service and to be subject to cost-of-service regulation (COSR) of their customer rates, usually by state utility commissions. The other 30% of electricity and 5% of gas are provided by publicly or mutually owned utilities.\nIOUs are granted regional franchises not subject to competition under the rationale that they \nare “natural monopolies”: their service can be most efficiently provided by a single entity.\n2 In \nprinciple, utility rates must be “just and reasonable”: sufficient to recover only the actual and prudent costs incurred in providing service to their captive customers.\nThere is an inherent tension in the cost of service–based utility regulatory model. As investor-\nowned businesses, IOUs seek to maximize their profits, which often runs headlong into regulators’ goal of achieving just and reasonable rates. Moreover, IOUs too often have the upper hand in their interactions with regulators, to the detriment of their customers. Over the last three years, IOU residential electricity rates have increased 49% more than inflation.\n3 In contrast, their publicly \nowned counterparts have increased 44% less than inflation. In some states, the contrast is even more stark. Investor-owned San Diego Gas & Electric’s residential rate increased by 78%, to over 45 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) between 2020 and 2023. Similarly sized Sacramento Municipal Utility District’s average residential rate rose less than inflation and, at less than 17 cents/kWh, is barely one-third of SDG&E’s. As a result of IOU price hikes, their residential customers’ average monthly electric bills hit $137, 15% higher than public utility residential customers’, compared to just 3% higher in 2020. As of September 2024, nearly one-quarter of US households were unable to fully pay their energy utility bills in at least one month in the past year.\n4 \nThis policy brief explains a root cause of this problem: excessive utility rates of return allowed by utility commissions in setting customer prices. Rate of return (ROR) is the time-value-of-money compensation to investors for assuming the risk of providing capital to the utility. After an overview of utility rate-making principles, this brief covers how excessive utility rates of return contribute to the divergence between investor and public interests, and how IOUs have been able \n1 “ Other providers,” retail power marketers and Community Choice Aggregators that sell almost exclusively through investor-owned utilities in  \nstates with consumer choice, are included in the IOU total.

It concludes with \ncommon-sense recommendations to realign utility investor incentives with the public interest, particularly codifying in legislation the long-standing regulatory standard setting the rate of return equal to the market-based cost of capital, standardizing the financial models used to calculate the cost of capital, improved coordination in the utility consumer advocate community, leveling the regulatory litigation playing field and fostering regulartory responsibility.\nIOUS’ COST-OF-SERVICE BUSINESS MODEL\nIn exchange for their monopoly franchises, IOUs agree to provide universal service within their service territories and to be subject to regulation of the rates they charge customers.\n5 This bargain \nbuilds on centuries-old American policy recognizing that certain privately owned property has such broad impact on society at large that it becomes “affected by a public interest” —\n \nresulting in \nlegal obligations to set fair prices for captive users.6 \nUtilities are typically subject to oversight by federal and state regulators.7 At the federal level, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates interstate power transmission, wholesale power sales, and hydropower licensing.\n8 IOUs are typically regulated by state \nregulatory commissions.9 The primary responsibilities of these regulators include determining \nwhat kind of infrastructure and investments are necessary to serve customers, and setting the rates utilities can charge for their services.\n10 Some state regulators determine the rates IOUs may \ncharge at fixed intervals (e.g., every two years) but many do not, and IOUs generally may request rate changes at any time.\n11 Such requests trigger regulatory proceedings, in which the IOUs have \nthe burden of showing that rate increases are needed to earn a fair rate of return.12  \nState regulators are obligated to ensure that rates are “just and reasonable.”13 State regulators often \n5  S ee, e.g., ibid. at 2, pp. 3-6; For a broader overview of other problems in the utility sector —  including IOU holding company consolidation –– see \nalso our companion report: Michael J.

Ongoing costs are those that are “consumed” as incurred, like power plant fuel, employee salaries, and rent. These costs are essentially passed through in rates, with no markup.\n15 Capital costs \nare those that are “consumed” over time, like power plants, pipelines, and transmission and distribution lines. While the utility pays for these upfront with an initial investment, they are recovered in rates over their useful life, which can be a decade or more. For example, for an investment with a 20-year useful life, 1/20, or 5%, of the initial cost will be recovered in rates each year. The annual charge for this return of capital is called “depreciation and amortization.”\n16\nAn additional prudent and actual cost utilities must recover is their cost of capital. When utilities make an investment, they are essentially making a “loan” to customers who pay it back, with “interest,” over time. Depreciation and amortization only cover the principle, or the return of capital; utilities also must be compensated for the return on capital. As with other costs, the just and reasonable standard requires that this return on capital be equal to the prudent and actual cost of capital, no more, no less.\nThe prudent cost of capital that is allowed to be \nrecovered in rates is simply the cost determined by financial markets. Utilities must compete with all other companies in the capital markets to attract investment. A rate of return below the cost of capital is not just and reasonable for the investors who provided capital in the past and will dissuade investors from providing the utility the capital it will need in the future.

Case Study: San Diego Gas & Electric  \nrevenue breakdown1\nThe earnings summary provided by San Diego Gas & Electric in its 2024 general rate case illustrates the composition of revenue for a typical US utility. The total revenue requirement is the sum of operating and capital costs. Operating costs account for roughly half; capital costs account for the other half. Of the capital cost component, roughly half is the return of capital, i.e., depreciation and amortization. The other half is the time-value-of-money return on capital — interest on debt, profits (net income) accruing to equity investors, plus taxes on net income, which are recoverable from customers and included in the revenue requirement.\n1  “ Revised Prepared Direct Testimony of Ryan Hom (Summary \nof Earnings) Before the Public Utilities Commission of the State \nof California,“ San Diego Gas & Electric Company, August 2022, https://www.sdge.com/sites/default/files/regulatory/SDGE-44-R%20Revised%20Direct%20Testimony%20R%20Hom-SOE_1414.pdf ; “Decision on Test Year 2020 Cost of Capital for the \nMajor Energy Utilities,” Public Utilities Commission of the State of California, Dec. 20, 2019, https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M322/K633/322633896.PDF .47%\n25%16%Net\nincome Income taxes\n5%\nInterest\n6%\nDepreciation \n& amortizationOperating \nexpensesFigure 1. SDG&E revenue breakdown\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n5 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTrate of return above the cost of capital is not just and reasonable for customers: they are paying \nmore than necessary for no benefit — an unjust enrichment of utility investors at the expense of customers.\nThe principle that rate of return should be set equal to the cost of capital (ROR = COC) has a long \nhistory, dating back to a concurring opinion penned by Supreme Court Justice Brandeis in 1923\n17 \nand formally adopted by the full Court in its landmark 1944 Hope Natural Gas decision.18\nLike other investor-owned companies, utilities finance their capital expenditures with a mix of debt and equity. A utility’s cost of debt is easy to determine; it’s simply the interest rate charged by its lenders. In contrast, its cost of equity (COE) is not directly observable; it must be estimated. The associated revenue requirement to compensate equity investors is calculated as cumulative investment (net of accumulated depreciation) multiplied by the equity ratio (the amount of equity in the overall capital structure) and the return on equity (ROE).\n19\nThat final calculation — cumulative net investment x equity ratio x ROE — equals the utility’s net income, or profit after taxes. As with any other for-profit business, an investor-owned utility’s primary objective is to maximize profit. This equation is therefore the key to understanding the unique utility business model and the incentives it creates for utility management and decision-making. \nFINANCIAL ALCHEMY OF ROE\nOf the three inputs into the utility profit function, ROE has the biggest potential impact on utility stock market value.\n20 Utilities therefore devote significant time, effort, and resources to convincing \nstate utility commissions to award them ROEs as high as possible. (That ROE is then an input for determining rates).\n17  S outhwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Svc. Comm’n, 262 U.S. 276, 291 (1923) (“The compensation which the Constitution guarantees an opportunity \nto earn is the reasonable cost of conducting the business.

These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock [citation omitted]. By that standard, the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks [emphasis added].” “[T]he return … commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks” is simply the opportunity cost of capital. This standard has been repeatedly endorsed by regulators, academics, and experts testifying on behalf of utilities. See also, e.g., Roger A. Morin, New Regulatory Finance, Public Utilities Reports, 2006, p. 23 (“The regulator should set the allowed rate of return equal to the cost of capital so that the utility can achieve the optimal rate of investment at the minimum price to the ratepayers.”).)\n19\n  W\nhile frequently used interchangeably in regulatory proceedings, COE and ROE are two distinct concepts. COE is the market-based, or \nopportunity, cost of equity or the (not directly observable) expected return on the market price of a company’s publicly traded stock. ROE is an accounting performance metric: net income divided by equity book value. See, e.g., ibid. at 10, p. 15.\n20\n  T\nhis is because, while utilities’ stock market value scales with the levels of cumulative investment and equity ratio, it scales with the difference \nbetween ROE and COE, not ROE.\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n6 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECT\nAnd they have been successful in doing so, winning approval for rates far exceeding the ROR \n= COC standard for decades. The clearest evidence that utilities earn more than their cost of equity is their stock market valuations. A fundamental principle of finance is that the value of an investment to asset with a return equal to its cost of capital is just the initial investment; if it is earning more than its cost of capital, the value will be greater than the initial investment and vice versa.\nUtility shareholders’ investment is the book value of equity as recorded in the utility’s financial \nstatements. By simply comparing utility stocks’ market prices to their book values (the market-to-book ratio, or M/B), we can see whether authorized returns are in line with utilities’ actual cost of equity.\nFigure 2 shows the average utility sector M/B over the last nearly 100 years. It has exceeded 1.0 for \nthe last 30 years and has hovered around 2.0 for the last 15 years.\n21 A rough rule of thumb equates \nM/B to the ratio of the ROE to COE.22 Utilities have been awarded ROEs approximately twice \ntheir actual, market-based cost of equity — in other words, twice what is “just and reasonable” — for over a decade.\n21  K enneth R.

The highest of 34 expected return forecasts, 8.3%, is a full 1.3% lower than the average authorized ROE. US utilities are lower risk than the market as a whole due to their cost-of-service regulatory model and relatively stable long-term growth, so their expected returns should be less than the 6.7% market average.\n25\n23  S ee, e.g., Tim Koller, Marc Goedhart, and David Wessels, Valuation (5th ed.), Wiley, 2010, p. 35 (“The cost of capital is the price charged by \ninvestors for bearing the risk that the company’s future cash flows may differ from what they anticipate when they make the investment.

Every dollar of shareholder capital they invest turns into roughly two dollars in their stock market value — a powerful incentive to invest as much as possible. The aggregate stock market value of all US investor-owned utilities is approximately $1.3 trillion. At the current M/B of 2.3, investors value the ongoing excess wealth extraction from utility customers at over a trillion dollars.\n26\nAs ROE increases relative to COE, M/B — the financial alchemy ratio — increases as well, setting up a vicious cycle in which inflated ROEs create an increasingly powerful incentive to invest, driving ever-upward spiraling profits — up 28% after inflation over the last five years, far outpacing GDP and electricity and gas demand (up 11%, 3%, and 6%, respectively) — and corresponding rate impacts.\n27\nTHE NEAR- AND LONG-TERM URGENCY TO \nADDRESS EXCESS RORS\nAnother consequence of excessive RORs is that they limit regulators’ ability to pursue other \npublic interest priorities. Regulators often offer utilities performance-based incentives, essentially profit “adders” for performing non-investment activities that serve the public interest, like conservation and efficiency. Given how much shareholder value utilities’ bread-and-butter investment in rate base creates, it is difficult to offer a performance incentive that can compete. As a result, the track record of such performance incentives is mixed, if not poor.\n28\nIOU investment, adjusted for inflation, has risen approximately 3.8% per year faster than demand over the last three decades, such that the amount of capital investment per kWh delivered was more than 2.5 times higher over the five years through 2023 than 25 years earlier\n29 — a clear \nreflection of utilities’ “capital bias,” the incentive created by excessive rates of return and their financial alchemy multiplier effect, to preferentially pursue the most capital-intensive means of \n26  A s of Nov. 22, 2024, the S&P 1500 Utilities Index market capitalization and M/B were $1.3 trillion and 2.3, respectively, implying an excess \nmarket capitalization of (2.3 – 1.0)/2.3 x $1.3 trillion = $0.73 trillion. Utilities collect from customers the state and federal taxes owed on these \nprofits, at a combined rate of approximately 26% (see Cristina Enache, “Corporate Tax Rates around the World, 2024,” Tax Foundation, Dec. 17, 2024, https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/global/corporate-tax-rates-by-country-2024/ ). The present value of the excess wealth the market \nexpects utilities to extract from customers is therefore $073 trillion / (1 – 26%) = $1.0 trillion. The S&P 1500 Utilities Index’s market capitalization also reflects the index members’ non-utility businesses, which account for account for approximately 10% of their total assets and revenue, but excludes non-publicly traded utilities like those owned by Berkshire Hathaway (see “2023 Financial Review,“ Edison Electric Institute, June 10, 2024, pp. 25, 29, https://www.eei.org/-/media/Project/EEI/Documents/Issues-and-Policy/Finance-And-Tax/Financial_ Review/FinancialReview_2023.pdf ). Applying the same M/B and combined tax rate to US investor-owned utilities’ 2023 FERC-reported (via S&P Global \nMarket Intelligence) book equity value of $0.66 trillion yields a wealth transfer of $1.1 trillion.\n27  S &P 1500 Utilities Index trailing-12-month operating earnings increased 51% in the five years through the third quarter of 2024; inflation over the \nsame period was 22%. https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-eps-est.xlsx.\n28  I\nbid. at 2.\n29  “ National Data: Fixed Assets Accounts Tables,” Bureau of Economic Analysis, accessed Dec. 10, 2024, https://apps.bea.gov/\niTable/?reqid=10&step=2&isuri=1; ibid. at 3.\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n9 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTserving customers.30 In contrast, state and local public utility investment rose only 0.6% faster \nthan demand over the same period, and the amount of capital invested per kWh delivered \nincreased only 20%.31\nThe result is a vicious cycle of ever-increasing rates. In just the last few years, average IOU residential rates have increased 49% more than inflation. This increase is not due to any fundamental change in IOUs’ true cost of service. The average rates of publicly owned utilities, which do not have the same incentives to over-invest, have increased at barely half the rate of inflation.\n32 As a result, the gap between IOU and public rates has more than doubled from 12% \nin 2020 (13.7 cents/kWh for IOUs vs. 12.2 for public utilities) to 29% in 2023 (17.3 and 13.4 cents/ kWh, respectively).\nExcess IOU RORs are a pressing pocketbook issue for American consumers. Economywide, \nexcess IOU RORs cost utility customers approximately $50 billion per year, or about 13.6% of total IOU gas and electric revenue.\n33 The cost to individual households averages over $300 per year.34 \nThis is excess utility profits — cost over and above a fair and reasonable rate of return — for which customers receive no benefit whatsoever.\nThe need to reduce RORs is particularly urgent as trillions of dollars are expected to be funneled \nthrough utilities for the energy transition, to mitigate rising wildfire and climate change risks, and to meet new sources of demand like electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.\n35 Bringing \nRORs into compliance with the regulatory standard would enable every dollar of utility revenue collected from customers for capital investment to go approximately 25% further — 25% more bang for every customer buck put toward utility investment.\n36\n30  “ Policy Explainer: How Utility Reform Can Align Profits with Climate Goals,” Climate XChange, Nov. 10, 2022, https://climate-xchange.\norg/2022/11/how-utility-reform-can-align-profits-with-climate-goals/ .\n31  I\nbid. at 30.\n32  I\nbid. at 3.\n33  A\ns of Nov. 22, 2024, the S&P 1500 Utilities Index forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings ratio was 18.9.

The value of a utility stock is simply the discounted present value of its \nfuture profits, so excess profits are (1 – B/M) x profits = $40 billion. Grossing-up for state and local taxes (combined rate of 26%), which are collected from customers, results in total excess customer costs of $55 billion.

Analyzing decades of data, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University concluded in 2019 that “[w]hat regulators should do, what regulators say they’re doing, and what regulators actually do may be three very different things.”\n38 Researchers at the \nUniversity California, Berkeley, reached similar conclusions in 2022.39\nHow have IOUs been able to get away with this for so long, when the evidence of excess ROEs is so clear? A number of factors are at work.\nCIRCULAR RATE CALCULATION MODELS THAT DEVIATE FROM \nTEXTBOOK FINANCIAL PRINCIPLES \nUtility regulatory proceedings are public, including the various filings submitted by utilities \nand other parties on the rate of return.

Two of them — the risk premium model and expected earnings analysis — are used only in utility regulatory proceedings and nowhere else in finance. This is because they do not even purport to estimate the cost of equity but merely calculate return on equity based on either historical regulatory-awarded ROEs (the risk premium model) or forecasts of future ROEs which, in turn, are based on recently awarded ROEs (the expected earnings analysis). Promisingly, in 2022, the FERC recognized these models’ circularity and prohibited their use, observing that they “def[y] general financial logic.”\n40 Nonetheless, both utility and non-utility experts continue to use \nthem in state proceedings, mostly unchallenged.\nThe other two models commonly used in utility regulatory proceedings, the capital asset pricing \nmodel (CAPM) and discounted cash flow model (DCF), are all used by other finance practitioners and academics. Nonetheless, utility ROR experts routinely implement the DCF and CAPM with unrealistic assumptions to arrive at results comparable to those produced by the conceptually flawed ROE-based models. Examples of faulty implementation include growth projections for corporate profits, which currently account for less than 10% of US GDP, overtaking GDP in its entirety within a decade or two; and relying on input assumptions from providers with multi-decade track records of systematic upward bias.\n41\nPUBLIC ADVOCATES AS UNWITTING ACCOMPLICES\nA second factor enabling utilities’ success in winning approval for unreasonable rates of return is their relative unity of purpose compared to advocates and intervenors.\n42 Utilities all recognize \n(1) the importance of high RORs and (2) that consistency helps them. Relying on the FERC-disapproved ROE-based models at the state level is a direct way utilities maintain consistency; each utility is simply referring to the ROEs awarded to its peers. They also maintain consistency indirectly, by engaging the same handful of firms to provide their ROR analysis and testimony. Of more than 60 ongoing proceedings as of November 2023, just four firms provided more than 90% of utilities’ ROR testimony.\n43 Two experts, one each from The Brattle Group and ScottMadden, \naccounted for more than half.\n40  Z ack Hale, “DC Circuit ruling gives FERC new chance to establish durable transmission ROEs,” S&P Global Market Intelligence, Aug. 12, 2022, \nhttps://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/dc-circuit-ruling-gives-ferc-new-chance-to-establish-\ndurable-transmission-roes-71694369 .\n41  “ Phase 2 Opening Testimony of Mark E.

To train them, utilities decades ago established a low-cost certification organization, the Society of Utility Regulatory Financial Analysts (SURFA). SURFA ’s curriculum includes the two conceptually flawed ROE-based models, as well as the CAPM and DCF. Indeed, the SURFA manual calls the comparable earnings method, its umbrella term for ROE-based models, the “‘grandaddy’ of cost of equity methods” even while acknowledging it “does not square well with economic theory.”\n44 \nThrough SURFA and the promulgation of flawed financial models, the utilities have effectively co-opted their potential opponents. Moreover, few advocates and intervenors appear to recognize the importance of ROR, in terms of its impact on rates and utility incentives. After all, their mostly SURFA-trained experts essentially retread the utilities’ playbook, using the same flawed methodologies as the utilities and consequently producing similarly flawed results, so the value at stake is not apparent to them. For example, two firms widely engaged by third-party intervenors and state consumer advocates (such as the Arizona Residential Utility Consumer Office and the South Carolina Utility Energy Users Committee) — such as Brubaker & Associates\n45 and J. \nPollack46 — both use the circular, FERC-prohibited risk premium model in state proceedings. So, \ntoo, did an expert who testified numerous times on behalf of FERC itself, as a consumer member of the Federal Executive Agencies, collectively the largest US electricity end-user, which regularly participates in utility regulatory proceedings.\n47  Dependent as they are on their own experts’ \nflawed analysis, advocate attorneys typically lack sufficient financial knowledge to effectively cross-examine utility witnesses.\n48\nIn addition, advocates often have competing interests and priorities, both among themselves and internally; even consumer protection organizations often have objectives beyond lower bills.\n49 \nLack of awareness of the value at stake combined with competing priorities is a recipe for neglect.\nEven when advocates do engage on ROR, they often inadvertently undermine their own efforts. \nDone correctly, ROR is grounded in well-established financial principles. Well-known, empirically validated models for estimating the cost of capital are taught in introductory finance courses, and the ranges of reasonable input assumptions are relatively narrow, either because they are directly observable in the market (e.g., dividend yields and interest rates) or bounded by macroeconomic \n44 D avid C.

FERC’s current ROR expert does not use these \nmodels.\n48 A c\nommon argument made by utilities in objecting to lower ROEs is that any potential savings are illusory: a lower ROE would impair the utility’s \ncredit, resulting in a higher cost of debt that would exceed any potential savings from lower ROEs. The appendix explains the flaws in this argument and demonstrates that utility profits can be significantly reduced while maintaining the utility’s desired credit rating.\n49  Fo r example, the mission of the California Public Advocates Office is “to advocate for the lowest possible bills for customers of California’s \nregulated utilities consistent with safety, reliability, and the state’s climate goals.” But its focus areas include distributed energy resources, natural gas decarbonization, and zero-emission vehicles.

Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for multiple \nadvocates each to hire several different ROR witnesses, who inevitably differ in one or more of their methodologies or assumptions, if not in their recommendations.\n51 Differing testimony among \nadvocates, who all want a lower rate, makes ROR seem much more subjective than it is. Why should a commission accept the advocates’ testimony over the utility’s if the advocates cannot even agree among themselves on basic financial principles?\nIn the rare instances where accurate ROR testimony is submitted, it is often disregarded — not on \nits merits, but simply because it differs so dramatically from what regulators are used to seeing and what other advocates submit.\n52\nUNEVEN PLAYING FIELD\nRegulatory proceedings are plagued by asymmetries of information, expertise, and resources. Utilities can spend as much as they want on their ROR and other proposals and their defense and pass on the cost to customers. Their gatekeepers and opponents, in contrast, are subject to significant constraints — limited budgets, broad missions, lowest-bid government procurement rules that result in lower-quality, often perfunctory testimony, procedural hurdles such as judicial deference, and politics (regulators are often appointed by governors who, in turn, often receive significant political donations from utilities and their unions)\n53 — all of which combine to create a \ngrossly uneven playing field. Given the sharp differences in their budgets and resources, utilities can easily overwhelm the regulatory process, diverting attention and resources away from the most consequential regulatory issues, such as ROR.\nAlthough this would seem to provide opportunities for advocates to find common cause with \nlarge commercial players, deep-pocketed entities tend to focus on improving their own individual lot rather than seeking systemic change. Like other parties, they also have competing interests. For example, large commercial users might focus on cost allocation across customer classes or the rate impact of incentive programs for which they are ineligible. Large industrial users like data \n50  Fo r example, both the CAPM and DCF are covered in widely used introductory finance textbooks. See Richard A. Breadley, Stewart C.

They are simply more likely—and more \nlikely to cause harm—in systems that are poorly designed and constructed, which is why we present a concrete set of reforms in this brief. As noted below, regulators can also take more responsibility to ensure they serve the public well.\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR BREAKING THE \nCYCLE\nAligning authorized returns with the cost of capital would eliminate the powerful financial \nincentive driving capital bias, transforming utility behavior and facilitating greater responsiveness to regulatory and public interests. The tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue freed up from lower utility profits could be returned to customers in the form of lower rates; redeployed to finance additional, needed investment for the energy transition; or a mix of both.\nAs ROE is brought closer to COE, M/B — the shareholder value multiplier — declines. The flip \nside of ROE financial alchemy is that reducing ROE is the key first step in both ending the upward rate spiral and getting utilities to pay due attention to other regulatory and public priorities. If investment becomes less attractive, then whatever rewards or penalties regulators impose for other activities become relatively more attractive. As others have observed, “ All regulation is incentive regulation.”\n62 \nLower ROEs can therefore achieve several important objectives:\n•\n R\neducing rates immediately by 10% or more\n•\n R\neducing incentives to over-invest (because the attractiveness of investment, as \nreflected in a lower M/B financial alchemy multiplier, is relatively lower) thereby slowing rate increases\n•\n R\nepurposing the freed-up investment “headroom” to accelerate needed investment \n(reliability, safety, environmental, demand, etc.)\n•\n I\nncreasing the relative importance of other regulatory priorities (e.g., customer service, \ncommunity engagement, labor relations, environmental investment, etc.)\nRestoring the ROR = COC standard can be thought of as regulatory alchemy, transforming a broken regulatory system into one that serves its intended purpose: just and reasonable rates to support prudent investment in the public interest.\ndownload?contentSequence=0&rowIndex=272, p. 141 (In estimating utilities’ perpetuity profit growth rate, which, mathematically, cannot \nexceed GDP growth: “[T]here was ‘no basis to believe that the growth in GDP would be comparable’ to the growth of regulated utilities”).\n62  I nara Scott, “Incentive Regulation, New Business Models, and the Transformation of the Electric Power Industry,” Michigan Journal of \nEnvironmental & Administrative Law, 2016, https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&context=mjeal .\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n16 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTBut the self-reinforcing factors sustaining excessive utility RORs have been at play for \ndecades. Breaking this dynamic will therefore require new approaches. Following are several recommendations that, pursued individually or jointly, can help break the vicious cycle.\nCODIFY ROR = COC\nThe problem of excess RORs would disappear if regulators simply complied with the nearly century-old case law standard and set the rate of return equal to the cost of capital.\n63 That they \nhave failed to do so for decades, though, suggests they must be legally compelled. The most straightforward and comprehensive remedy is therefore to codify the ROR = COC standard through federal legislation. \nIn addition to clarifying regulators’ objective in determining the rate of return, legislation should \ndirect the appropriate regulatory bodies to develop rules that constrain acceptable models, analyses, assumptions, data, and testimony.\n64 As explained above, specific models and assumptions \nthat are known to be flawed should simply be barred. \nSTANDARDIZE ROR CALCULATION MODELS\nIf ROR = COC is not codified in legislation, advocates and intervenors should use standardized COC calculation models grounded in conventional financial principles. The finance theory and models used to estimate COC do not vary from state to state, so the methodologies and data sources used in determining ROR should be the same across all utilities. \nSHARE INFORMATION AND RESOURCES AMONG PUBLIC \nADVOCATES\nRate of return therefore does not pose the same coordination challenges as other concerns about \nutility regulation, such as environmental issues, which can be more variable across state lines due to different laws. \nLowering rates is also a universal concern, in contrast to other public interest concerns, which \nmay be in tension with each other and involve tradeoffs that split coalitions. Furthermore, the success of other important initiatives hinges on restoring utilities’ incentives to pay attention to anything other than growing rate base. \n63  R egulators in other countries already tether ROR to COC, with better outcomes for consumers. See, e.g., “UKRN guidance for regulators \non the methodology for setting the cost of capital,” UK Regulators Network, March 2023, https://ukrn.org.uk/app/uploads/2023/03/CoC-\nguidance_22.03.23.pdf ; “Rate of Return: What does it mean for consumers?,” Australian Energy Council, March 9, 2023, https://www.\nenergycouncil.com.au/analysis/rate-of-return-what-does-it-mean-for-consumers/ ; “Economic Trends Shift Canadian Utility ROEs,” Concentric \nEnergy Advisors, Feb. 6, 2024, https://ceadvisors.com/economic-trends-shift-canadian-utility-roes/ .\n64  S ee, e.g., New York Senate Bill S6557A, https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S6557 .\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n17 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTAdvocates and intervenors should therefore coordinate across regions and states to share \ninformation and resources and develop common long-term media relations and advocacy strategies.\n65 There are few if any organizations that both span multiple regions and focus on \nROR. In the context of regulatory proceedings, advocates and intervenors should pivot to retaining experts who are not indoctrinated by SURFA but rather come from a normative finance background. They should also share best practices and templates for testimony, cross-examination scripts, and briefs to build common strategies for rebutting invalid, but nonetheless still widely used, models and assumptions. \nREBALANCE LITIGATION \nA fourth avenue for addressing ROR abuse is through litigation. Utility regulatory proceedings typically take place in administrative courts with their own appeals processes. Decisions can be appealed to non-administrative courts, but the hurdles can be significant.\nProcedurally, most states have adopted doctrines similar to the recently overruled Chevron \ndeference,\n66 imposing a high legal burden to challenge a regulatory decision.67 Essentially, \nappellants must demonstrate that the regulatory decision reflects a misinterpretation of the law. Unless ROR = COC is codified in law, states should limit the deference accorded to utility regulators with respect to rate determinations.\nLegislators should also take measures to facilitate public advocacy. FERC, at the direction of \nCongress, has taken steps including establishment of an Office of Public Participation to educate the public about how to participate in FERC proceedings.\n68 But FERC should adopt an intervenor \nfunding or compensation program as well.69 Laudably,  some states have authorized programs \nto compensate advocates for the costs of their participation in utility regulatory proceedings, regardless of the outcome, but fewer than half are active.\n70 Among those outside California, the \nonly state that provides an overall budget sufficient to finance substantive participation and offers uncapped reimbursement of reasonable actual costs, these programs effectively serve as mere fig leaves to give the appearance of encouragement of stakeholder participation and of a level playing field for intervenors.\n65  Fo rmer FERC ALJ Scott Hempling has observed that “intervenors … treat proceedings like win-loss contests rather than building blocks in a \npolicy edifice.” See Scott Hempling, “Effective Regulatory Procedures: Purposes, Practices and Paths,” Australian Competition & Commerce \nCommission/Australian Energy Regulator Conference, August 2016, p. 16, https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Presentation%20by%20Scott%20Hempling%2C%20Attorney%20at%20Law%2C%20Maryland%20%2C%20USA%2C%20commentator%20on%20the%20Effective%20Regulation%20of%20Public%20Utilities.pdf .\n66\n  S\nee Loper Bright Enterprises v.

Michigan offers reimbursement of actual costs, \nbut aggregate available compensation is only about $2 million per year for all proceedings statewide. In addition, compensation is grant-based, not reimbursement of actual costs, burdening intervenors with the risk of proceedings that are inherently uncertain. Even in California, reimbursement can be delayed over two years and is subject to substantial retrospective regulatory discretion. See ibid. at 43.\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n18 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTFOSTER REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY\nHempling’s explanation of capture also points to regulators’ personal roles in addressing it. Just \nas “[o]ne can enter that state [of capture] through one’s own actions or inactions. One can allow oneself to be captured. One can assist, and sustain, one’s own captivity,”\n71 one can resist, end, \nand prevent their captivity. Hempling offers constructive insight into the purpose of regulation (to “align,” not “balance,” interests in accordance with the law), as well as recommendations for prioritizing issues and framing proceedings as educational seminars, not adversarial contests.\n72\nLegislators can assist by fostering a more neutral political environment for regulatory deliberation. While prohibited in most states, some still allow utilities to recover lobbying expenses in customer rates.\n73 The practice should be universally banned.\nSome regulators have started to adopt a less passive, more inquisitive attitude toward excessive rates of return. As described above, FERC has acknowledged the circularity inherent in two of the utilities’ favored methodologies and banned their use. Similarly, and in sharp contrast to her counterparts in Wisconsin and Florida, California Public Utilities Commissioner Darcie Houck has publicly endorsed many of the arguments put forth by advocates and intervenors, including: the legal requirement, established across three SCOTUS precedents, to set the rate of return equal to the cost of capital; the compelling evidence offered by utility market-to-book ratios that authorized ROEs exceed this legal standard; and excess rates of return encourage excessive utility capital spending.\n74\nEven where regulators have focused on ROR, though, there is ample room for improvement. The remaining two models FERC approved produce results comparable to the systematically biased rejected models – a clear indication of errors in their implementations.\n75 This obvious \nlogical inconsistency eluded FERC’s notice. And, despite her acknowledgement in a public voting meeting of California’s excessive ROEs and their implications for the state’s electricity affordability crisis, Commissioner Houck nonetheless voted in favor of the decision authorizing their continuation.\n71  I bid. at 4.\n72  I\nbid., pp. 11-15. \n73  S helby Green, “Tracking State Legislation to Get Politics Out of Utility Bills,” Energy and Policy Institute, updated April 15, 2024, https://\nenergyandpolicy.org/tracking-states-getting-politics-out-of-utility-bills/ .\n74  “ Voting Meeting At 11:00 AM,” California Public Utilities Commission, Oct. 17, 2024, https://www.adminmonitor.com/ca/cpuc/voting_\nmeeting/20241017/ .\n75  F\nERC’s recommended implementations of the two remaining models rely on economically impossible long-term stock market growth rates.\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n19 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTCONCLUSION \nExcessive utility rates of return are the root of everything that’s wrong with the US utility sector \n— capital bias, spiraling rates, unresponsiveness to consumer interests, and grudging compliance with public policy goals. Despite the clear nature of the problem, its persistence over decades suggests new approaches are needed. \nThe costs of maintaining the status quo are self-evident: tens of billions of dollars in customer \novercharges, every year, forever; continued upward-spiraling rates; no change in utility incentives or behavior; continued disregard of the public interest; and perhaps trillions of dollars of foregone investment in energy innovation, grid resilience, and safety measures. With a wide variety of public interest goals on the line — including, most directly, affordability for consumers — the time to act is now. \nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n20 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTAPPENDIX\nDO HIGHER INTEREST COSTS OFFSET ROE SAVINGS? \nOne of the most common arguments made by utilities in objecting to lower ROEs is that any \npotential savings are illusory: a lower ROE would impair the utility’s credit rating – potentially triggering a downgrade – resulting in higher costs of debt (COD) that would exceed any potential savings from lower ROEs. Yet when pressed to provide any analysis or examples demonstrating the increase in COD would exceed the ROE customer savings, utilities cannot do so.\n1\nA lower ROE can impact a utility’s cost of debt by reducing the amount of cash flow available to cover interest payments: lower profits and cash flow increase the risk of non-payment, and therefore the cost of debt. But any incremental increase in the cost of debt is overwhelmed by the customer savings on utility profits. A basic understanding of utility rate making and credit markets explains why.\nThe effect of changes in ROE on the total combined cost of debt and equity, which is what \nmatters to customers, is the result of three inter-relationships: (1) ROE’s contribution to the cash flow-to-debt ratio (CF/D), which is the key metric used by credit rating agencies to assess utility credit quality;\n2 (2) the relationship between credit rating and COD (i.e., interest rate); and (3) the \nrelative contributions of ROE, grossed-up for federal and state income taxes, and COD to total customer costs.\nFigure 4 shows the CF/D and corresponding interest rate premium relative to the 30-year \nTreasury (T30) at different credit ratings.\n3 Notably, the change in interest rate premium is \nrelatively modest even for significant changes in credit quality: an increase of approximately 0.6% for a halving of cash flow coverage and 6-notch downgrade (from Aa2 to Baa2).\n4\nFigure 4\nMoody’s credit rating Aa A Baa\nCF/D 26% - 35% 18% - 26% 11%-18%\nCOD – T30 1.1% - 1.3% 1.3% - 1.5% 1.5% - 2.0%\n1  S ee, e.g., Letter and testimony from Mark E.

See, e.g., NextEra Energy, “Financial Strength: Credit Ratings Summary,” \nhttps://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/fixed-income-investors/financial-strength . For definitions of these different measures, see, e.g., \nAndrew Holmes, “Cash Flow and Liquidity,” Moody’s Analytics, January 2014, https://rmgfinancial.com/core/files/rmgfinancial/uploads/files/Cash%20Flow%20and%20Liquidity%20(Holmes).pdf .\n3  M oody’s Analytics, “Ratings: Regulated Electric and Gas Networks,” April 13, 2022, https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/386754 , \npp. 4-6 (CF/D metrics); S&P Global Market Intelligence (historical Utility and Treasury bond interest rates; May 1992 - August 2023 average).\n4\n  E\nach grade is comprised of 3 notches, e.g., A1, A2, A3. Cash flow and interest rate changes are interpolated from rating band endpoints.\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n21 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTAt current authorized ROEs of approximately 10%, net income – ROE x equity – accounts for \nroughly half of cash flow;5 other components include depreciation and amortization, deferred \ntaxes, and various rating agency adjustments that are not sensitive to changes in net income.6 \nConsequently, even a 50% reduction in ROE would reduce the key CF/D metric by only 25%.\nAn illustrative example demonstrates the positive trade-off, for consumers, between a lower \nROE and a higher COD. Assume a utility with a 50/50 debt/equity ratio and a 10% authorized ROE, or 13.5% after grossing-up for state and federal income taxes, which are passed through to customers.\n7 At the typical 50% net income-to-cash flow ratio, its CF/D would be 20%, putting \nit at the low end of the A rating band (A3), a common rating for utility operating companies.8 \nAssuming a 5% cost of debt, the total customer rate of return on both debt and equity combined, including taxes, is 9.3%.\n9\nA 40% reduction in ROE, to 6% (8.1% including taxes), would reduce CF/D by 20%, to 16%, at the high end of the Baa rating band (Baa1). The corresponding interest rate would be 5.2%.\n10 The \nnew total customer ROR is 6.7%, 28% lower than with a 10% ROE, even after accounting for the increase in the cost of debt.\nAll else equal, reducing ROE inevitably reduces a utility’s credit quality. Although the higher \ninterest costs entailed are outweighed by the customer savings on utility profits, utilities and regulators may nonetheless wish to maintain a minimum credit quality standard. This can be achieved by increasing the amount of equity in the capital structure. Doing so raises CF/D by both increasing net income (the numerator) and decreasing debt (the denominator).\n11 Reducing \nthe amount of debt in the capital structure also has a salutary effect on other key metrics monitored by rating agencies, including the debt-to-capitalization and cash flow-to-interest ratios.\n12\n5  Fo r a more detailed explanation of the inter-relationships between ROE, CF/D, and debt interest rate, see “Phase 2 Opening Testimony of Mark \nE.

S&P’s A- rating is equivalent to Moody’s A3.\n9\n  T\nhe total cost of capital charged to customers is the weighted average cost of equity, grossed-up for taxes, and debt: [E x ROE / (1 – tax rate) + D \nx COD] / (E + D), where E and D are the dollar amounts of equity and debt, respectively.\n10\n  E\nstimates interpolated from CF/D and COD rating band endpoints.\n11  U tilities sometimes claim, erroneously, that increasing the equity ratio would require recalling outstanding debt, potentially incurring make-\nwhole payments and penalties (see, e.g., Ex. JIOU-01, Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. et al., Reply Testimony on Affordability, Timing, and Capital Structure, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Application No. 22-04-008, Feb. 26, 2024, p. 21, https://pgera.azurewebsites.net/Regulation/ValidateDocAccess?docID=784959) . In any given year, an amount equivalent to approximately 10% of the outstanding debt balance is issued, \nboth to replace retiring debt and to invest in rate base growth (e.g., average debt tenor of 20 years and 5% growth). Consequently, simply by not issuing any new debt, utilities could reduce their debt ratio by 10 percentage points (say, from 50% to 40%) in 2 to 3 years.\n12  S ee, e.g., Moody’s Analytics, “Ratings: Regulated Electric and Gas Networks,” April 13, 2022, https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-\ndocuments/386754 .\nSchedule ME-2 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n22 AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECTIn our example, maintaining a 20% CF/D would require increasing the equity ratio to 58% \nfrom 50%. With more equity in the capital structure, the total customer rate of return increases slightly, to 6.8%, but is still 27% lower than the 10% ROE base case.\nFigure 5\nEquity | debt ROE CODCustomer ROR\n26% tax rateCF/D Credit rating\n50 | 50 10.0% 5.0% 9.3% 20% A3\n50 | 50 6.0% 5.2% 6.7% 16% Baa1\n58 | 42 6.0% 5.0% 6.8% 20% A3\nFor simplicity, this illustrative example assumes ROE does not change with credit quality. In practice, the cost of equity (COE) varies with credit rating: the improved credit quality that accompanies a higher equity ratio reduces COE. If ROE is adjusted accordingly, as required under the ROR=COC standard, the changes in ROE and COD roughly offset each other, such that customer savings would be the same under either credit rating.\n13\nThis illustrative example demonstrates that (1) contrary to utility assertions, the potential increase in COD from a lower ROE is overwhelmed by the customer savings on utility profits; and (2) any potential reduction in credit quality (and resultant increase in COD) can be completely offset with an increase in equity ratio.\n13  Fo r a more detailed explanation, see “Phase 2 Opening Testimony of Mark E.

INTRODUCTION  .......................................................................................................................  1 3 \nA. Qualifications  .......................................................................................................................  1 4 \nB. Testimony Summary  ...........................................................................................................  2 5 \nII. THE COMMISSION SHOULD FIND THAT THE PURPOSE OF COST OF CAPTIAL 6 \nPROCEEDINGS IS TO DETERMINE THE UTILITES’ ACTUAL COSTS OF 7 \nCAPITAL, NOT TO DETERMINE AUTHORIZED RATES OF RETURN BASED ON 8 \nOTHER AUTHORIZED RATES OF RETURN THAT FAR EXCEED UTILTIES’ 9 \nACTUAL COSTS OF CAPITAL.  ................................................................................................  7 10 \nA. Rate of Return on Capital and Cost of Capital are not the same: Rate of Return 11 \non Capital is a Financial Performance Metric; Cost of Capital is a Measure of 12 \nEconomic Cost.  ................................................................................................................... 7  13 \nB. Well- Established Legal and Regulatory Standards Establish That the 14 \nCommission Should Set ROR Equal to COC in Cost of Capital Proceedings. ................... 9  15 \nC. Abundant, Robust Evidence Reveals that Authorized Rates of Return Far Exceed 16 \nthe Utilities’ Actual Costs of Capital.  ................................................................................. 13 17 \n1. Investment firms’ expected return forecasts for the U.S. equity market as a 18 \nwhole – which is riskier, on average, than utilities – are consistently lower 19 \nthan utilities’ authorized ROEs.  ..................................................................................  13 20 \n2. Utility market -to-book ratios reveal that utilities’ cost of equity is substantially 21 \nlower than authorized ROEs.  .....................................................................................  15 22 \n3. Peer -reviewed academic research concludes authorized ROEs far exceed 23 \nutilities actual cost of equity.  .......................................................................................  27 24 \n4. Utilities’ own internal estimates of their cost of equity are significantly lower 25 \nthan the ROEs they request and the ROEs the Commission approves.  ................... 28 26 \n5. Excess ROEs create a cycle of upward spiraling growth in rate base and 27 \ncustomer rates.  ...........................................................................................................  29 28 \n6. The California Utilities’ spiraling rates have hit their customers particularly 29 \nhard.  ............................................................................................................................ 34 30 \nIII. THE COMMISSION SHOULD REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO PROVIDE 31 \nQUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE INTER -RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ROE AND 32 \nCREDIT METRICS TO SUPPORT THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND ROE 33 \nPROPOSALS........................................................................................................................... 35 34 \nA. ROE and Capital Structure Both Affect Credit Quality and Therefore Cannot Be 35 \nDetermined Separately.  .................................................................................................... 35 36 \n1. ROE and capital structure interact to affect key credit metrics.  ................................ . 35 37 \n2. Utilities should be required to analyze quantitatively the interaction of ROE 38 \nand capital structure in their ROE and equity ratio proposals.  ...................................  36 39 \nB. COE and Therefore the Appropriate ROE Are Also Affected by Capital Structure.  .........  38 40 \n1. COE estimates should account for differences in proxy group members’ 41 \ncapital structures.  .......................................................................................................  39 42 \n2. Utilities’ ROE proposals should reflect their proposed equity ratios, not the 43 \nproxy group members’.  ............................................................................................... 42 44 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nC. ROE and Equity Ratio Should Be Optimized to Minimize Customer Costs While 1 \nMeeting Investor Requirements.  .......................................................................................  42 2 \n1. Utilities’ ROE and E/C proposals are not optimized to minimize customer 3 \ncosts while ensuring investor interests are also satisfied.  ..........................................  42 4 \n2. The trade- off between ROE and E/C highlights the need for more rigorous, 5 \nquantitative analysis.  .................................................................................................. 49 6 \nIV. THE COMMISSION SHOULD PROHIBIT USE OF THE FLAWED RISK PREMIUM 7 \nMODEL BECAUSE THE MODEL’S CIRCULARITY AND USE OF HISTORICAL 8 \nAUTHORIZED ROEs RENDER THE  MODEL UNRELIABLE AND INAPPROPRIATE 9 \nFOR USE IN COST OF CAPITAL PROCEEDINGS.  ..............................................................  52 10 \nV. THE COMMISSION SHOULD PROHIBIT USE OF THE FLAWED EXPECTED 11 \nEARNINGS ANALYSIS BECAUSE OF THE MODEL’S CIRCULARITY AND USE OF 12 \nHISTORICAL OR FORECAST BOOK ROEs RENDER THE  MODEL UNRELIABLE 13 \nAND INAPPROPRIATE FOR USE IN COST OF CAPITAL PROCEEDINGS.  .......................  55 14 \nVI. WHEN UTILIZING THE DCF MODEL, THE COMMISSION SHOULD PROHIBIT 15 \nPARTIES FROM PROJECTING ANALYSTS’ 3-TO-5- YEAR GROWTH FORECASTS 16 \nINTO PERPETUITY.  ............................................................................................................... 58 17 \nVII. WHEN UTILIZING THE CAPM, THE COMMISSION SHOULD PROHIBIT PARTIES 18 \nFROM INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS, DATA SOURCES, AND MODIFICATIONS 19 \nTHAT LACK CONCEPTUAL OR EMPIRICAL VALIDITY.  ......................................................  64 20 \nA. The Commission Should Require Parties to Utilize the Current Risk -Free Rate, 21 \nNot Forecast Risk -Free Rates.  .........................................................................................  65 22 \nB. The Commission Should Require Parties to Evaluate Multiple Sources and 23 \nMethodologies in Estimating  Beta, as Opposed to Utilizing a Single Source or 24 \nEstimation Methodology.  ...................................................................................................  70 25 \nC. The Commission Should Prohibit Use of Adjusted Beta, Which Is Not Valid for 26 \nUtilities.  ..............................................................................................................................  73 27 \nD. The Commission Should Prohibit the Constant Growth DCF Using Analyst 28 \nGrowth Forecasts and Forecast Risk -Free Rates in Calculating a Forward - 29 \nLooking MRP.  ....................................................................................................................  79 30 \nE. The Commission Should Require Parties to Use the Total, Not Income -Only, 31 \nBond Return in Calculating a Historical MRP.  .................................................................. 80 32 \nF. The Commission Should Require Parties to Use Geometric, Not Arithmetic, 33 \nReturns, in Calculating a Historical MRP.  .........................................................................  84 34 \nG. The Commission Should Prohibit Parties from Utilizing the Empirical CAPM.  ................. 88 35 \nVIII. THE COMMISSION SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES OF THE UTILITIES’ 36 \nPERSISTENT COST OF DEBT OVER -COLLECTION SO THAT IT MAY 37 \nIMPLEMENT MEANINGFUL MEASURES TO MINIMIZE IT.  ................................................. 94 38 \nA. The Utilities Have Persistently Over -Collected Their Cost of Debt.  .................................. 94 39 \n1. Cost of debt over -collection materially impacts customers costs – and 40 \nexecutive compensation.  ............................................................................................ 95 41 \n2. Upwardly biased interest rate forecasts are a contributing factor in cost of 42 \ndebt over -collection.  ...................................................................................................  97 43 \nB.

Please state your name and professional affiliation.  3 \nA. My name is Mark E. Ellis. I am an economic and financial consultant. My business address is 4 \n8595 Nottingham Place, La Jolla, CA 92037. 5 \n 6 \nQ. On whose behalf are you testifying?  7 \nA. I am testifying on behalf of The Protect Our Communities Foundation (PCF). 8 \n 9 Q. Do you certify under penalty of perjury that, to the best of your knowledge, the 10 \ntestimony you will give in this proceeding is true and correct?  11 \nA. Yes. 12 \n 13 Q. Please summarize your education and professional work experience.  14 \nA. I graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Materials 15 \nSciences and Engineering and from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Master 16 \nof Science in Technology and Policy. 17 \n  I have over 30 years of professional experience in the energy industry. Before starting my 18 \nconsulting practice in 2020, I led the strategy function at Sempra Energy for fifteen years. 19 \nMy responsibilities included developing and implementing the enterprise- wide cost of capital 20 \nestimation process. This critical corporate finance function entailed thorough and ongoing 21 \nresearch of the academic and practitioner literature on the historical cost of capital and the 22 \nvarious cost of capital estimation methodologie s and models; creating a process to estimate, 23 \nquarterly, the forward -looking, risk- adjusted cost of capital for Sempra’s portfolio of 24 \ncompanies spanning a variety of geographies and lines of business; and calibrating the results 25 \nagainst historical data and reputable, objective third -party estimates.  26 \n  Previously, I held various positions in strategy, project development, and engineering 27 \nwith McKinsey, ExxonMobil, Southern California Edison, and Sanyo Electric. 28 \n  In 2023, I provided expert testimony on behalf of The Protect Our Communities 29 \nFoundation (PCF) before the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in Phase 1 of 30 \nthis proceeding. In 2022, I provided expert testimony on behalf of PCF before the CPUC in 31 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nthe three California Utilities’ consolidated application s (A.21- 08-013 et seq.) to suspend the 1 \nCost of Capital Mechanism (CCM). In 2020, I provided expert testimony on behalf of The 2 \nUtility Reform Network (TURN) before the CPUC in PG&E’s application (A.2 1-20- 04-23) 3 \nfor a $7.5- billion wildfire cost securitization. I have also recently testified on the rate of 4 \nreturn in North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire. Attachment MEE-1 5 \ncontains more detail about my background. 6 \n 7 \nB. Testimony Summary  8 \nQ. What is the purpose of your testimony in this proceeding?  9 \nA. I have been asked by PCF to assess and develop recommendations regarding the following 10 \nquestion outlined in the Scoping Memo: “ [w]hether other policy modifications should be 11 \nordered with regard to future cost of capital application cycles .”1 This question includes , 12 \ninter alia,  “[a]ppropriate methodologies for calculating return -on-equity,” “[m]easures to 13 \nprevent circularity, self -reference, and status quo biases; ” and “affordability considerations. ”2 14 \n 15 \nQ. Please summarize your testimony. 16 \nA. I make the following seven recommendations for  modifications that should be ordered with 17 \nregard to future cost of capital application cycles , each supported by detailed analysis and 18 \nother evidence: 19 \n  (1) The Commission should find  that the goal of CPUC cost of capital proceedings is to 20 \nestimat e the U tilities’ respective cost s of capital. I provide abundant, robust evidence 21 \ndemonstrating that authorized returns in California and nationwide far exceed the 22 \nrequirements of Hope  and other legal and regulatory standards requiring regulators to allow 23 \nutility investors an “opportunity to earn returns sufficient to ‘attract capital .’”3  24 \n 1 A.22 -04-008 et seq., Assigned Commissioner’s Ruling Consolidating Four Applications and Scoping \nMemo and Ruling (July 12, 2022), p. 3; A.22 -04-008 et seq., Administrative Law Judge’s Ruling \nOutlining Phase 2 Issues and Schedule (October 31, 2023), p. 2. \n 2 A.22-04-008 et seq. , Administrative Law Judge’s Ruling Outlining Phase 2 Issues and Schedule  \n(October 31, 2023) , p. 3-4.  \n3  Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v.

(1944) 320 U.S. 591,  605 ( “Rates which enable the company to operate \nsuccessfully, to maintain its financial integrity, to attract capital, and to compensate its investors for \nthe risks assumed certainly cannot be condemned as invalid, even though they might produce only a \nmeager r eturn on the so-called ‘fair value’ rate base.”)  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  (2) The Commission should find that capital structure and ROE are interdependent ; and  1 \nthe Commission should order the Utilities to provide evidence sufficient to allow the 2 \nCommission to determine capital structure and ROE  jointly, incorporating consideration of 3 \nkey metrics used by credit rating agencies. 4 \n  (3) The Commission should follow the example of FERC in prohibiting the use of 5 \nfinancial models based  on historical authorized ROEs , like the Risk Premium Model, due to 6 \ntheir inherent circularity.   7 \n  (4) The Commission should follow the example of FERC in prohibiting the use of 8 \nfinancial models based on historical or forecast book ROEs, like the Expected Earnings 9 \nAnaly sis, due to their inherent circularity.  10 \n  (5) The Commission should prohibit projecting analysts’ 3- to-5-year growth forecasts 11 \ninto perpetuity in the DCF model, due to their limited forecast horizon and economically 12 \nimpossible implications.  13 \n  (6) The Commission should prohibit, in the impl emen tation of the CAPM, several 14 \ncommon assumptions, data sources, and modifications, due to their lack of conceptual or 15 \nempirical validity.  16 \n  (7) The Commission should investigate the causes of Utilities’ persistent cost of debt 17 \nover- collection  and implement measures to minimize it. 18 \n  Figure 1 lists each of my recommendations and its rationale.  19 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nFigure 1 . Summary of recommendations  1 \nRecommendation  Rationale  \n1. Find rate of return must be equal to the \ncost of capital  • Persistent confusion and misunderstanding despite w ell-\nestablished legal, regulatory, and economic standard  \n2. Require integrated quantitative analysis \nof equity ratio, ROE, and credit quality  • Critical to any meaningful analysis and to credit rating \nagencies  and investor s \n \n3. Prohibit models based on authorized \nROE, e.g., Risk Premium Model  • Do not produce a market -based COC (confuse ROR \nand COC)  \n• Not used elsewhere in finance \n• Rejected by FERC  4. Prohibit models based on historical or \nforecast book ROE, e.g., Expected \nEarnings Analysis  \n5. Prohibit , in the DCF,  projection of \nanalysts’ 3 -to-5-year growth forecasts \ninto perpetuity  • Forecasts valid only 3 to 5 years  \n• Produces economically impossible results  \n6. Prohibit , in the implementation  of the \nCAPM, se veral common  flawed \nassumptions , data sources, and \nmodifications  • Lack conceptual or empirical validity  \n• Forecast interest rates  • Inconsistent with DCF timing  \n• Systematic upward bias  \n• Current rate is best available predictor  \n• Single source for bet a • Different calculation methods can produce widely \nvarying results over time  \n• Multiple sources should be examined  \n• Adjusted beta  • Not valid for utilities  \n• Forward -looking MRP: CG DCF w/ \nanalyst growth rates  • Forecasts valid only 3 to 5 years  \n• Produces economically impossible results  \n• Historical MRP   \n– Income -only, not total, bond return s • Inconsistent with use of realized total returns for market  \n• Not an investable asset  \n– Arithmetic, not geometric, average \nreturns  • Geometric better reflects long -term investor \nexpectations  \n• ECAPM  • Invalid application of academic research: u tility (long -\nterm) cost of capital is not analogous to the (short -term) \nresearch on which ECAPM is based  \n• No independent research or textbooks  endorsing \nECAPM \n• Adjusting for long- term utility COC, research findings do \nnot hold  \n7. Investigate and minimize persistent cost \nof debt over -collection  • Material impact on customer costs – and executive \ncompensation  \n• Not completely explained by upwardly biased interest \nrate forecasts  \n 2 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nQ. Please concisely state any proposed ordering paragraphs that the Commission should 1 \nissue in the second phase of this proceeding .4 2 \nA. The Commission should order that the purpose of its cost of capital proceedings is to set a 3 \nutility’s rate of return on equity equal to  its cost of equity capital.   4 \n The Commission should or der the Utilities to provide evidence sufficient to allow the 5 \nCommission to determine capital structure and ROE jointly, inc orporating consideration of 6 \nkey metrics used by credit rating agencies.  7 \n The Commission should prohibit the use of the Risk Premium Model because it is circular, 8 \nbased on historical authorized ROEs.  9 \n The Commission should prohibit the use of the Expected Earnings Analysis because it is 10 \ncircular, based on historical or forecast book ROEs. 11 \n The Commission should order that, when utilizing the DCF model in cost of capital 12 \nproceedings, parties shall not project analysts’ 3 -to-5-year growth forecasts into perpetuity . 13 \n The Commission should order that, when utilizing the CAPM in cost of capital proceedings, 14 \nparties shall not utilize common assumptions, data sources, and modifications that lack 15 \nconceptual or empirical validity.  16 \n The Commission should order an investigation into the causes of the Utilities’ persistent cost 17 \nof debt over-collection. 18 \n The Commission should order the development of measures to minimize the Utilities’ 19 \npersistent cost of debt over -collection , informed by the results of the investigation into the 20 \ncauses of the Utilities’ persistent cost of debt over-collection. 21 \n 22 \nQ. Please concisely state any specific findings and conclusions of law  that would justify the 23 \nproposed orders.5 24 \nA. The Commission should find that the purpose of its cost of capital proceedings is to set a 25 \nutility’s rate of return on equity equal to  its cost of equity capital.   26 \n The Commission should conclude that the “cost of capital is the minimum rate of return 27 \nnecessary to attract capital to an investment.”6   28 \n The Commission should find that capital structure and ROE are interdependent. 29 \n The Commission should find that the Risk Premium Model is based on historical authorized 30 \nROEs.  31 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n The Commission should find that the Expected Earnings Analysis is based on historical or 1 \nforecast book ROEs. 2 \n The Commission should find that the Risk Premium Model and the Expected Earnings 3 \nAnalysis are circular . 4 \n The Commission should find that, when utilizing the DCF model, projecting a nalysts’ 3- to-5- 5 \nyear growth forecasts  into perpetuity involves the invalid and unrealistic use of these 6 \nforecasts, which have a limited forecast horizon , and economically impossible implications. 7 \n The Commission should find that parties should not, when utilizing the DCF model in cost of 8 \ncapital proceedings, project analysts’ 3 -to-5-year growth forecasts into perpetuity.  9 \n The Commission should find that parties should not, when utilizing the CAPM in cost of 10 \ncapital proceedings, include assumptions, data sources, and modifications that lack 11 \nconceptual or empirical validity. 12 \n The Commission should find that the Utilities’ persistent cost of debt over-collection 13 \nwarrants an investigation of the causes of the persistent debt over -collection.  14 \n The Commission should find that measures to minimize the Utilities’ persistent cost of debt 15 \nover- collection  should be implemented based on the findings of the investigation of the 16 \ncauses of the persistent debt over -collection.  17 \n I summarize the evidentiary basis for each of these in Figure 1, and below I provide the 18 \nfollowing testimony describing the  evidentiary basis for each of these.  19 \n 20 \n 4 A.22 -04-008 et seq., Administrative Law Judge’s Ruling Outlining Phase 2 Issues and Schedule \n(October 31, 2023), p. 4 (“Parties are directed to concisely state, in their opening testimony and \nopening briefs, any proposed ordering paragraphs that they seek the Commission to issue in the \nsecond phase of this proceeding.”).  \n 5 A.22 -04-008 et seq., Administrative Law Judge’s Ruling Outlining Phase 2 Issues and Schedule \n(October 31, 2023), p. 4 (“Parties shall also concisely state any specific findings and conclusions of law that would justify their proposed orders, as well as the basis in evidence for their proposed \nfindings and conclusions of law.”).  \n6 Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC (D.C. Cir.) (1991) 926 F.2d 1206, 1208, citing to A. Lawrence \nKolbe et al., The Cost of Capital: Estimating the Rate of Return for Public Utilities 13 (1984).  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nII. THE COMMISSION SHOULD FIND THAT THE PURPOSE OF  COST OF 1 \nCAPTIAL PROCEEDINGS IS TO DETERMINE THE UTILITES’ ACTUAL 2 \nCOSTS OF CAPI TAL, NOT TO DETERMINE AUTHORIZED RATES OF 3 \nRETURN BASED O N OTHER A UTHORIZED RATES OF  RETURN THAT FAR 4 \nEXCEED UTILTIES ’ ACTUAL COSTS OF CAPITAL. 5 \nA. Rate of Return on  Capital and Cost of Capital are not the same: Rate of 6 \nReturn on Capital is a Financial Performance Metric; Cost of Capital is a 7 \nMeasure of Economic Cost.  8 \nQ. What should be the goal of the Commission’s  cost of capital proceeding s? 9 \nA. A cost of capital proceeding authorizes the total rate of return on capital that utilities are 10 \nallowed to recover in customer rates. The goal of a cost of capital proceeding is to determine 11 \nthe amount of each source of capital – common equity, preferred equity, and debt – and a 12 \nreturn on each that is as close as possible to the actual cost of each source of capital. The 13 \ncommon name of the proceedings in which authorized returns are determined, including in 14 \nCalifornia – cost of capital – reveals this intention that the financial return should match the 15 \neconomic cost. The questions articulated in the Scoping Memo implicitly acknowledge this 16 \ngoal, referring to the “cost” of various sources of capital.7 17 \n 18 \nQ. How does the rate of return on capital differ from the cost of capital?  19 \nA. The rate of return on capital, often shortened to  as “rate of return,” is a measure of financial 20 \nperformance, calculated by dividing the value returned  to investors – e.g., interest, preferred 21 \ndividend, net income – by the amount of capital invested. The cost of capital is the return 22 \ninvestors expect  on their investment.  23 \n  It is referred to as a cost because it reflects what investors demand in return for assuming 24 \nthe risk of the investment and, therefore, what companies must pay for that investment. The 25 \nrate of return on each form of capital, whether calculated retrospectively or estimated 26 \nprospectively, may or may not equal its respective cost of capital. 27 \n 28 \n 7 A.22 -04-008 et seq., Assigned Commissioner’s Ruling Consolidating Four Applications and Scoping \nMemo and Ruling (July 12, 2022), p. 3.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nQ. Why is the distinction between the cost of capital and rate of return important?  1 \nA. The cost of capital and rate of return (on capital) are entirely different concepts. The rate of 2 \nreturn is a financial performance metric. The cost of capital is an economic concept. 3 \nNonetheless, they are frequently referred to interchangeably in utility regulatory proceedings, 4 \nperhaps in part because finance professionals commonly refer to the cost of capital as the 5 \nexpected  return (on capital).8 6 \n  The muddling of the difference between the cost of capital and the rate of return is not 7 \njust of semantic concern, particularly when calculating the return on equity. Unlike 8 \noutstanding debt and preferred equity, whose costs of capital can be directly observed from 9 \ntheir respective market rates of return (interest and dividend, respectively), which in turn can 10 \nbe used to accurately estimate the cost of any future issuances,9 the cost of equity, both 11 \nexisting and to-be-issued, cannot be directly observed and must be estimated using various 12 \nmodels. 13 \n  This confusion between the cost of  capital and the return on capital has infiltrated some 14 \nof the models commonly used in utility cost of capital proceedings to estimate the cost of 15 \nequity. W ide use of these models and apparent influence on regulatory decisions does not 16 \nrender them correct , or mean they provide a suitable basis for estimating the cost of equity.  17 \n  In Phase 1, all four U tilities used at least one model based on historical or forecast rates 18 \nof return, without reference to utilities’ actual cost of equity : the Risk Premium (PG&E,10 19 \nSCE,11 SDG&E ,12 SoCalGas13) and Expected Earnings ( SDG&E ,14 SoCalGas15) models .  20 \n 8 See, e.g.,  Koller  et al., Valuation , 5th ed. (2010), p. 35 (“The cost of capital is the price charged by \ninvestors for bearing the risk that the company’s future cash flows may differ from what they \nanticipate when they make the investment. The cost of capital to a company equals the minimum \nreturn that investors expect to earn from investing in the company. That is why the terms expected \nreturn to investors and cost of capital  are essentially the same.  The cost of capital is also called the \ndiscount rat e, because you discount future cash flows at this rate when calculating the present value of \nan investment, to reflect what you will have to pay investors.”) (emphasis in original).  \n 9 As explained in Section V.B.1  below, though, despite the relative transparency of the cost of debt, \nSoCalGas’s and SDG&E ’s authorized costs of debt have systematically exceeded their actual costs \nfor many years.  \n 10 Exhibit PG&E -01 (Vilbert) , p. 2- 53. \n 11 Exhibit SCE- 02 (Villadsen ), p. 49-53. \n 12 Exhibit SDG&E -04 (Coyne ), p. 42 -45. \n 13 Exhibit SCG -04 (Coyne ), p. 42-45.  \n 14 Exhibit SDG&E -04 (Coyne), p. 45- 47. \n 15 Exhibit SCG- 04 (Coyne), p. 4 5-47. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  The Commission should reject outright the Risk Premium and Expected Earnings models . 1 \nThe Risk Premium and Expected Earnings models incorporate no information about the 2 \nactual cost of equity and are therefore inherently flawed and produce invalid results.

Well- Established Legal  and Regulatory Standards Est ablish  That the 6 \nCommission Should Set ROR Equal to COC  in Cost of Capital Proceedings. 7 \nQ. Please briefly describe the regulatory framework  for setting the ROR equal to COC . 8 \nA. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) explains: 9 \nFor a utility, a fair rate of return must be provided to investors and must be 10 \nincluded in the revenue requirement in order to adequately cover the cost of 11 \ndoing business in ratemaking and tariff- setting. Fundamental financial 12 \nconcepts demonstrate that the fair rate of return to use in ratemaking for a 13 \nutility is its cost of capital in order to achieve the proper balance between 14 \ncustomers and investors. This overall fairness equation follows:  15 \n 16 \nROR = WACC  17 \n 18 \nWhere ROR = Rate of Return; and  19 \n 20 \nWACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital.16 21 \n  FERC has similarly endorsed the ROR=COC standard:  22 \nThere is compelling economic justification for relying on the market cost of 23 \ncapital as the standard for rate of return decisions.  Furthermore, a market cost 24 \nof capital approach addresses both the comparable earnings and attraction of 25 \ncapital standards of the Hope  decision .17 26 \n 16 National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, Cost of Capital and Capital Markets: A \nPrimer for Utility Regulators (December 2019), p. 10, available at \nhttps://pubs.naruc.org/pub.cfm?id=CAD801A0-155D -0A36-316A -\nB9E8C935EE4D&_gl=1*znlz4w*_ga*MTY0NTQyMjE3NC4xNzA0ODM4MzYw*_ga_QLH1N3Q\n1NF*MTcwNTE4NDA4MC4zLjAuMTcwNTE4NDA4MC4wLjAuMA../ . \n 17 FERC Order No. 569, 169 FERC ¶ 61,129, p. 1 03 fn. 426 (citing Generic Determination of Rate of \nReturn on Common Equity for Public Utilities , Order No. 489, FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 30,795 at \n30,993, reh’g denied , Order No. 489-A, 42 FERC ¶ 61,390 (1988) ). \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n The courts, too, recognize the economic principle that the “cost of capital is the minimum 1 \nrate of return necessary to attract capital to an investment.”18 2 \n 3 \nQ. How can we be sure that setting ROR equal to COC will allow the utilities to attract 4 \ncapital?  5 \nA. If a utility can attract capital, it is operating successfully from a financial perspective.  Let’s 6 \nconsider the two components of capital, debt and equity, separately. 7 \n  With respect to attracting debt, as I will explain in more detail later in my testimony, the 8 \nability to attract capital is largely a function of credit quality. It is long -standing and nearly 9 \nuniversal practice for utilities to request, and regulators to approve, capital structures and 10 \nrates of return that enable utilities to maintain high -quality credit ratings , “investment grade” 11 \n(S&P BBB/Moody’s Baa) or better, precisely for the purpose of ensuring their ability to 12 \nattract debt capital.  As long as util ities maintain investment grade credit ratings, it is 13 \nreasonable to assume they can attract debt capital.  14 \n 15 Q. What about equity? How can we be sure that setting the ROE equal to COE will allow 16 \nthe utilities to  attract capital?  17 \nA. It’s important to recognize that the cost of equity , and all other forms of capital, is 18 \nsynonymous with the expected return on equity. As explained in the widely used finance text 19 \nValuation, published by consulting firm McKinsey & Company: 20 \nThe cost of capital is the price charged by investors for bearing the risk that 21 \nthe company’s future cash flows may differ from what they anticipate when 22 \nthey make the investment. The cost of capital to a company equals the 23 \nminimum return that investors expect to earn from investing in the company. 24 \nThat is why the terms expected return to investors  and cost of capital  are 25 \nessentially the same.  The cost of capital is also called the discount rate, 26 \nbecause you discount future cash flows at this rate when calculating the 27 \npresent value of an investment, to reflect what you will have to pay 28 \ninvestors.”19 29 \n18 Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC (D.C. Cir.) (1991) 926 F.2d 1206, 1208 (citing to A.

By definition, then, the current price reflects the return required to attract 2 \ncapital. Except in extreme cases, like bankruptcy, publicly traded companies like utilities can 3 \nalways  attract equity capital.20 4 \n  As long as utilities maintain investment grade credit ratings  and remain out of 5 \nbankruptcy, the investor interest in capital attraction requirement of “just and reasonable”  is 6 \nsatisfied . Setting  ROE equal to COE  satisfies the cost recovery requirement.  7 \n 8 \nQ. Is the ROR=COC standard recognized by cost of capital experts?  9 \nA. Yes. Regulatory economists and cost of capital practitioners have recognized  the ROR=COC 10 \nstandard for decades.  11 \n  MIT finance professor and Brattle Group colleague of PG&E and SCE witnesses Vilbert 12 \nand Villadsen , Stewart C. Myers articulated this standard as far back as 1972 : “Regulation 13 \nshould assure that the average expected rate of return on desired new investment is equal to 14 \nthe utility’s cost of capital.”21 15 \n  Economic consultants A. Lawrence Kolbe, James A. Read, Jr., and George R. Hall, at the 16 \ntime with Charles River Associates, devoted a section of their 1984 book, The Cost of 17 \nCapital: Estimating the Rate of Return for Public Utilities , to explain why the rate of return 18 \nshould be set equal to the cost of capital, on three grounds: law,22 economics,23 and 19 \n 20 Even in bankruptcy, utilities are often able to raise equity. See, e.g.,  Reuters, PG&E raises $5.5 \nbillion as it eyes exit from bankruptcy next week (June 26, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN23X0WN/ . \n 21 Myers, The Application of Finance Theory to Public Utility Rate Cases , The Bell Journal of \nEconomics and Management Science, Vol. 3, No. 1 (Spring, 1972), p. 80.  \n 22 Kolbe, Read, Hall, The Cost of Capital: Estimating the Rate of Return for Public Utilities  (The MIT \nPress, 1984)  (“The Cost of C apital ”), p. 21 -22 (“The United States Supreme Court has established \nthat investors in companies subject to rate regulation must be allowed an opportunity  to earn returns \nsufficient to attract capital and comparable to those they would expect in the unregulated sector for \nbearing the same degree of risk. The Bluefield  and Hope  cases provide the seminal decisions. … \nSince by definition, the cost of capital of a regulated firm represents precisely the expected return that investors could anticipate from other investments while bearing no more and no less risk, and since investors will not provide capital unless the investment is expected to yield its opportunity cost of capital, the correspondence of the definition of the cost of capital with the court’s definition of  legally \nrequired earnings appears clear. These two approaches are harmonized when the allowed rate of return is set equal to the cost of capital.” (emphasis in original )). \n \n23 Kolbe et al., The Cost of Capital , p. 22 (“ Direct and indirect economic benefits flow from setting the \nallowed rate of return for a regulated firm equal to the cost of capital.

Therefore, setting the allowed rate of return equal to thi s \ncost is ‘fair’ to investors. Another premise of regulation is that customers should be protected from \nthe exercise of the monopoly power  that may exist in in the industries that society chooses to regulate. \nOne undesirable consequence of monopoly power is the earning of excess returns on investment.

For example, the popular personal finance website, The Motley 4 \nFool, explains:33 5 \nUtility stocks typically make stable investments. Demand for utility services 6 \nsuch as electricity, natural gas, and water distribution tends to remain steady, 7 \neven during a recession. Meanwhile, the rates they charge for delivering these 8 \nservices are either regulated (approved by a government entity) or 9 \ncontractually guaranteed (non- regulated), so utilities generate reliable 10 \nearnings. That also allows them to pay dividends with above- average yields.  11 \n 12 \nThe combination of predictable profitability and income generation makes 13 \nutility stocks lower- risk options for investors because they’re less volatile.  14 \n Investors therefore have lower  expected returns than the market as a whole. That authorized 15 \nutility ROEs are so much higher than the expected returns on the higher- risk overall market 16 \nis a compelling indicator that authorized ROEs far exceed utility investors’ expected returns, 17 \ni.e., utilities’ actual cost of equity. 18 \n 19 \n2.

In practical, dollars- and-cents terms, what does it mean for a utility to have a market 1 \nvalue that is higher than its book value?  2 \nA. In practical terms, this means that, for every dollar of equity a utility invests, shareholders 3 \nreceive back not just their investment plus a reasonable return, which would be the case when 4 \nM/B = 1.0, but additional value equivalent to their equity investment multiplied by (M/B – 5 \n1.0). At current M/B ratios near 2.0, authorized ROEs effectively double the value of 6 \nutilities’ equity investments, in addition to returning their cost of equity. Such high returns 7 \nare not necessary to attract capital and needlessly increase customer costs.  8 \n 9 \na.

Yes, PG&E witness Villadsen and SCE witness Vilbert, in their book Risk and Return for 15 \nRegulated Industries , and widely-cited utility cost of capital expert Roger Morin, in his book 16 \nNew Regulatory Finance , have attempted to refute the argument that utility market- to-book 17 \nratios indicate ROEs exceed their costs of equity.  18 \n 19 \nQ. Please describe the flaws in SDG &E witness Coyne’s argument.  20 \nA. In his rebuttal testimony, witness Coyne attempts to explain utility M/B ratios greater than 21 \n1.0 by presenting a regression analysis of historical utility sector average M/B ratios against 22 \nTreasury yields.40 The analysis demonstrates that utility M/B ratios are sensitive to interest 23 \nrates, which is expected, because interest rates influence the cost of equity. The analysis also 24 \ndemonstrates that ROEs have not declined in line with the decline in interest rates over the 25 \nlast several decades, which is precisely the argument made by those who point to high M/B 26 \nratios as evidence that ROEs exceed COEs. Witness Coyne’s regression analysis does not 27 \nincorporate either ROEs or COEs, though, and therefore does not, and can not, tell us 28 \nanything about the relationship between ROE and COE. 29 \n 40 Exhibit SDG&E -08 (Coyne), p. 21 -22. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  Under cross-examination, witness Coyne agreed that (1) ROE is the return on book 1 \nequity value; (2) M/B greater than 1.0 means investors pay more than book value to purchase 2 \nutility stocks (i.e., equity); (3) paying more for the same stream of cash flows necessarily 3 \nresults in a lower expected return (i.e., COE). T he necessary implication of these statements 4 \nis that utility M/B ratios greater than 1.0 reflect ROEs greater than COE.  5 \n 6 \nb.

Please describe the flaws in the argument made by  witnesses Villadsen  and Vilbert ? 11 \nA. In Risk and Return for Regulated Industries , witnesses Villadsen and Vilbert, and the very 12 \nsame Kolbe who previously advocated the use of M/B as a “guide to regulators,” refer to 13 \nNobel laureate Robert Shiller’s prize lecture to argue that  market prices do not necessarily 14 \nreflect investors’ expected  returns, and therefore M/B ratios greater than 1.0 do not indicate 15 \nthat a utility is expected to earn  more than its cost of capital : 16 \n[W]e now know that the market- to-book ratio does not  signal reliably whether 17 \na utility earns more or less than its cost of capital.  18 \n… 19 \nProfessor Shiller holds instead that market prices are materially affected by 20 \nhuman traits that are not always in accord with pure economic rationality. 21 \nAmong other things, Professor Shiller has shown that the standard present 22 \nvalue formula does not explain stock prices, which are too volatile for that 23 \nmodel to hold true. If stock prices are nonetheless rationally priced, it is in 24 \naccord with a formula that we do not yet know.41 25 \n  Yet in that very same address Shiller points out that his research on “human traits” and 26 \n“economic rationality” applies only to the market overall, not to individual stocks: 27 \nThese conclusions about the aggregate stock market, however, do not carry 28 \nover fully to individual stocks. [Nobel laureate] Paul Samuelson has asserted 29 \nthat: 30 \n 31 \n 41 Villadsen, Vilbert, Harris, Kolbe, Risk and Return for Regulated Industries  (Elsevier, 2017), p. 295 -\n296 (emphasis in original).  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n[The market is] micro efficient but macro inefficient. That is, individual stock 1 \nprice variations are dominated by actual new information about subsequent 2 \ndividends, but aggregate stock market variations are dominated by bubbles. 3 \n… 4 \nThus, bubbles and their bursts cannot have more than a minor impact on the 5 \nreturns of individual stocks, and most of the variation in their returns comes 6 \nfrom news about the future payouts the firms will make.42 7 \n Shiller goes on to specifically explain that “ratios” like M/B  “reflect real knowledge about 8 \nfuture cash flows ” and are therefore “ useful approximation of reality for individual firms ”: 9 \nIn individual firms there is sometimes a lot of action in the ratios, and the 10 \naction in fact often reflects real knowledge about future cash flows. That is an 11 \nexample of the kind of idiosyncratic knowledge about individual firms that 12 \nmakes the efficient markets model a useful approximation of reality for 13 \nindividual firms .43 14 \n  Villadsen et al. misinterpret Shiller’s research by applying his findings about the 15 \naggregate market to individual stocks, which Shiller expressly warns against . Shiller 16 \nestablishes that t he market -to-book ratio reveals important information about the value of 17 \nindividual stocks like utilities , and does , in fact, “signal reliably whether a utility earns more 18 \nor less than its cost of capital .” 19 \n 20 \nc. Widely cited utility cost of capital expert Roger Morin’s 21 \nvarious reasons why utility M/B ratios greater than 1.0 do not 22 \nindicate ROE greater than COE are all deeply flawed. 23 \nQ. Does Morin acknowledge the relationship between M/B ratio and ROE?  24 \nA. Yes. Morin  acknowledges the fundamental relationship between market- to-book ratio and 25 \nROE : 26 \n[I]f regulators set the allowed rate of return equal to the cost of capital, the 27 \nutility’s earnings will be just sufficient to cover the claims of the bondholders 28 \nand shareholders.

Intuitively, if r > K, 3 \nand is expected to remain so, then market price will exceed book value per 4 \nshare since shareholders are obtaining a return [on book equity] in excess of 5 \ntheir opportunity cost.44 6 \n  Nonetheless, Morin advises regulators not  to look at the M/B ratio for guidance in 7 \ndetermining whether ROE exceeds the cost of equity:  8 \nIt is sometimes argued that because current M/B ratios are in excess of 1.0, 9 \nthis indicates that companies are expected by investors to be able to earn more 10 \nthan their cost of capital, and that the regulating authority should lower the 11 \nauthorized return on equity, so that the stock price will decline to book value. 12 \nIt is therefore plausible, under this argument, that stock prices drop from the 13 \ncurrent M/B value to the desired M/B range of 1.0 times book. 14 \n 15 \nThere are several reasons why this view of the role of M/B ratios in regulation 16 \nshould be avoided.45 17 \n  Morin provides four reasons to ignore M/B ratios in assessing ROEs. All four are flawed; 18 \nsome lack any reasonable foundation. 19 \n 20 \nQ. What are the flaws in Morin’s four reasons not to use M/B as an indicator of the 21 \nrelationship between ROE and COE.  22 \nA. Morin’s first reason , that setting the ROE such that M/B equals 1.0 requires investors to be 23 \nirrational, is flawed because it rests on an unrealistic assumption . He assumes that investors 24 \nexpect the M/B to be higher but nonetheless invest in the knowledge that the M/B will be  1.0. 25 \nThis is not a realistic assumption about investor behavior.  26 \n  Morin’s second reason  is flawed because it does not actually provide any reason to reject 27 \nthe M/B=1.0 standard. It merely restates the basic relationship between M/B, ROE, and COE.  28 \n  Morin’s third reason is flawed because it assumes (1) regulators must allow utilities to 29 \nover-earn in future periods to compensate for any past under- earning; and (2) that M/B ratio 30 \nis what determines a company’s ability to attract capital. Neither of these assumptions is true.  31 \n 44 Morin, New Regulatory Finance  at 359. \n 45  Morin, New Regulatory Finance  at 376. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  Morin’s fourth reason is flawed because it assumes a non- existent regulator standard: that 1 \nregulators are required to set returns such that utilities’ market values equal replacement cost, 2 \nbut M/B=1.0 standard would limit  utilities’ market value only to book value. 3 \n 4 \nQ. Please describe the flaw in  Morin’s first reason for his claim that regulators should 5 \navoid using M/B ratios as a guide in setting authorized ROEs . 6 \nA. The flaw in Morin’s first reason is that it rests on  an unrealistic assumption. H e assumes 7 \ninvestors would invest expect ing the M/B to be higher than 1.0 even in the full knowledge 8 \nthat the regulator intends to set the ROE such that M/B will be 1.0. This is not a realistic 9 \nassumption about investor behavior. 10 \n  Morin  maintains  that setting the ROE such that M/B equals 1.0 requires investors to be 11 \nirrational, investing with full knowledge they will incur a loss : 12 \nThe view that regulation should set an allowed rate of return so as to produce 13 \nan M/B of 1.0 presumes that investors are irrational . They commit capital to 14 \na utility with an M/B in excess of 1.0, knowing full well that they will be 15 \ninflicted a capital loss by regulators. For example, assume a utility company 16 \nwith an M/B ratio of 1.5. If investors expect the regulator to authorize a return 17 \non book value equal to the DCF cost of equity, the utility stock price would 18 \ndecline to book value, inflicting a capital loss of some 30%. The notion that 19 \ninvestors are willing to pay a price of 1.5 times book value only to see the 20 \nmarket value their investment drop by 30% is irrational.46 21 \n  This argument begs the question – or assumes what must be proven. Morin’s unstated 22 \nassumption is that investors are willing to pay 1.5 times book value for the utility’s shares 23 \nwith full knowledge that regulators will reduce the authorized ROE to the COE . The only 24 \nreason investors would be willing to pay 1.5 times book value, though, is precisely because 25 \nthey do not  “expect the regulator to authorize a return on book value equal to the DCF cost of 26 \nequity.” If they did expect regulators to reduce the ROE to the COE, the M/B ratio would not 27 \nbe 1.5 but much closer to 1.0, as Morin suggests (“the utility stock price would decline to 28 \nbook value, inflicting a capital loss of some 30%”). Morin’s hypothetical – “assume a utility 29 \ncompany with an M/B ratio of 1.5” – is accepted as “rational” only because regulators in 30 \n 46 Morin, New Regulatory Finance  at 376 (emphasis added).  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nnearly every state have a decades -long track record of authorizing ROEs far in excess of 1 \nactual COEs and, so far, have given no indication that they will not continue to do so. 2 \nQ. Please describe the flaw in  Morin’s second reason  for his claim that regulators should 3 \navoid using M/B ratios as a guide in setting authorized ROEs . 4 \nA. Morin’s second reason  is flawed because it does not actually provide any reason to reject the 5 \nM/B=1.0 standard. It merely restates the basic relationship between M/B, ROE, and COE : 6 \nThe condition that the M/B ratio will gravitate toward 1.0 if regulators set the 7 \nallowed return equal to capital costs will be met only if the actual return 8 \nexpected to be earned by investors is at least equal to the cost of capital on a 9 \nconsistent long-term basis and absent inflation. The cost of capital of a 10 \ncompany refers to the expected long- run earnings level of other firms with 11 \nsimilar risk. If investors expect a utility to earn an ROE equal to its cost of 12 \nequity in each period, then its M/B ratio would be approximately 1.0 or higher 13 \n…47 14 \n Morin provides no reason in this passage for regulators not to set the COE such that the M/B 15 \nequals 1.0. 16 \n  It should be noted that Morin’s qualification regarding inflation is  not warranted. 17 \nExpected inflation is reflected in the cost of both debt and equity capital. For example, 18 \ninterest rates rose in 2022 and 2023 as actual and expected inflation increased. To the extent 19 \nROE is based on the actual cost of equity, it will necessarily incorporate expected inflation. 20 \nThere is no need for the economy to be “absent inflation” for the basic relationship between 21 \nM/B ratio, ROE, and COE to hold. 22 \n 23 \nQ. Please describe the flaw in Morin’s third reason for his claim that regulators should 24 \navoid using M/B ratios as a guide in setting authorized ROEs . 25 \nA. Morin’s third reason is flawed because it assumes (1) regulators must allow utilities to over - 26 \nearn in future periods to compensate for any past under -earning; and (2) that M/B ratio is 27 \nwhat determines a company’s ability to attract capital. Neither of these assumptions is true.  28 \nMorin’s third reason entails several different arguments.  29 \n  Morin’s first argu ment  is that M/B ratios greater than 1.0 are necessary because 30 \nregulators must compensate utilities for periods when their M/B ratios were less than 1.0 : 31 \n 47 Morin, New Regulatory Finance  at 376.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nThe achievement of a 1.0 M/B ratio is appropriate, but only in a long- run 1 \nsense. For utilities to exhibit a long -run M/B ratio of 1.0, it is clear that during 2 \neconomic upturns and more favorable capital market conditions, the M/B ratio 3 \nmust exceed its long -run average of 1.0 to compensate for the periods during 4 \nwhich the M/B ratio is less than its long -run average under less favorable 5 \neconomic and capital market conditions.  6 \n 7 \nHistorically, the M/B ratio for utilities has fluctuated above and below 1.0. It 8 \nhas been consistently above 1.0 from the 1980s to the mid-2000s [and since 9 \nthen, as well]. This indicates that earnings below capital costs and M/B ratios 10 \nbelow 1.0 during less favorable economic and capital market conditions must 11 \nnecessarily be accompanied with earnings in excess of capital costs and M/B 12 \nratios above 1.00 during more favorable economic and capital market 13 \nconditions.48 14 \n  Going back to 1925, the average M/B ratio for utilities has been 1.4; regardless of the 15 \ncalculation starting point, the historical average has never been lower than 1.36 (from 1931 16 \nthrough 2023).49 Mathematically, ROEs could be set at a level to keep M/B ratios at 1.0 into 17 \nperpetuity without the average dropping below 1.0. The facts flatly contradict Morin’s claim 18 \nthat “[f]or utilities to exhibit a long -run M/B ratio of 1.0, it is clear that during economic 19 \nupturns and more favorable capital market conditions, the M/B ratio must exceed its long-run 20 \naverage of 1.0 to compensate for the periods during which the M/B ratio is less than its long - 21 \nrun average under less favorable economic and capital market conditions.” 22 \n  More importantly, contrary to Morin’s above assertion that “earnings below capital costs 23 \nand M/B ratios below 1.0 during less favorable economic and capital market conditions must 24 \nnecessarily be accompanied with earnings in excess of capital costs and M/B ratios above 25 \n1.00 during more favorable economic and capital market conditions,” there is no regulatory 26 \nprinciple requiring rates to be set so as to compensate current and future shareholders for past 27 \nearnings shortfalls, especially shortfalls that were last experienced by shareholders in the 28 \n1980s. Morin has fabricated this argument out of whole cloth. 29 \n  Morin’s third reason includes a second argument , that an M/B less than 1.0 would 30 \nprohibit a utility from attracting capital: 31 \n 48 Morin, New Regulatory Finance , p. 377 (emphasis added).  \n 49 M.

Moreover, if regulators were 4 \nto currently set rates so as to produce an M/B of 1.0, not only would the long- 5 \nrun target M/B ratio of 1.0 be violated, but more importantly, the inevitable 6 \nconsequence would be to inflict severe capital losses on shareholders. 7 \nInvestors have not committed capital to utilities with the expectation of 8 \nincurring capital losses from a misguided regulatory process.50 9 \n  The implication of Morin’s claim that “utilities cannot be expected to compete for and 10 \nattract capital in an environment where industrials [and other companies] are commanding 11 \nM/B ratios well in excess of 1.0 while regulation reduces [utilities’] M/B ratios toward 1.0” 12 \nis that investors will invest only in the companies with the highest M/B ratios. A moment’s 13 \nreflection reveals this simply cannot be true. Investors buy the shares of companies spanning 14 \na range of M/B ratios, including those with M/B ratios  less than 1.0, like General Motors, 15 \nwith an M/B ratio of 0. 64 as of January 19, 2024.51 And, as just explained above, rates could 16 \nbe set “so as to produce an M/B of 1.0” into perpetuity without “violating” Morin’s fictitious 17 \nregulatory “long- run target M/B ratio of 1.0.”  18 \n  Morin acknowledges that even utilities  with M/B ratios less than 1.0 can “compete for 19 \nand attract capital in an environment where industrials [and other industries] are commanding 20 \nM/B ratios well in excess of 1.0”:  21 \nThe above example [illustrating the adverse consequences for existing 22 \nshareholders of selling stock below book value] does not imply that utilities 23 \ncannot, in fact, raise capital when share prices are below book value, but that 24 \nthey can only do so at the expense of existing shareholders.52 25 \n  It is important to recognize that Hope  established that regulators are not obligated to 26 \nmaintain utility stock market valuations, and that such an obligation would make a nonsense 27 \nof regulators’ consumer protection mandate:  28 \n 50 Morin, New Regulatory Finance , p. 377 (emphasis added).  \n 51 Yahoo!

The fixing of prices, like 1 \nother applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property 2 \nwhich is being regulated. But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean 3 \nthat the regulation is invalid.  It does, however, indicate that “fair value” is the 4 \nend product of the process of ratemaking, not the starting point, as the Circuit 5 \nCourt of Appeals held. The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to 6 \ndepend upon “fair value” when the value of the going enterprise depends on 7 \nearnings under whatever rates may be anticipated.53 8 \n  The impact on existing shareholders of reducing ROEs to a level that brings M/B ratios to 9 \nthe Hope  and NARUC standard of 1.0 should not factor at all into regulators’ determination 10 \nof the appropriate rate of return.  11 \n 12 \nQ. Please describe the flaw  in Morin’s fourth reason for his claim that regulators should 13 \navoid using M/B ratios as a guide in setting authorized ROEs . 14 \nA. Morin’s fourth reason is that the M/B=1.0 would set utilities’ market value equal to book 15 \nvalue, but regulators are required to set returns such that utilities’ market values equal 16 \nreplacement cost . This reason is flawed because there is no such regulatory standard.  17 \n  Morin asserts that regulators must set the rate of return such that the value of the utility is 18 \nequal to the replacement cost of its assets : 19 \nRate of return regulation is fundamentally a surrogate for competition. The 20 \nfundamental goal of regulation should be to set the expected economic profit 21 \nfor a public utility equal to the level of profits expected to be earned by firms 22 \nof comparable risk, in short, to emulate the competitive result. For unregulated 23 \nfirms, the natural forces of competition will ensure that in the long run, the 24 \nratio of the market value of these firms’ securities equals the replacement cost 25 \nof their assets. Competitive industr ials of comparable risk to utilities have 26 \nconsistently been able to maintain the real value of their assets in excess of 27 \nbook value, consistent with the notion that, under competition, the Q- ratio will 28 \ntend to 1.00 and not the M/B ratio. This suggests that a fair and reasonable 29 \nprice for a public utility’s common stock is one that produces equality 30 \nbetween the market price of its common equity and the replacement cost of its 31 \nphysical assets. The latter circumstance will not necessarily occur when the 32 \nM/B ra tio is 1.0.54 33 \n 53 Fed. Power Comm'n v. Hope Nat. Gas Co.  (1944)  320 U.S. 591, 60  (emphasis added).  \n 54 Morin, New Regulatory Finance , p. 377 (emphasis added).  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  Morin is correct that “[r]ate of return regulation is fundamentally a surrogate for 1 \ncompetition.” But the “competitive result” is different for utilities than for competitive 2 \nindustrials. As Kahn observed, “returns in industry generally contain some monopoly 3 \ncomponent” and the risk profiles of nonregulated industries are not comparable to utilities.55 4 \nIn addition: 5 \n[I]f utility stocks are compared with those of non-utility corporations …, 6 \nutilities which are protected from many forms of competition will be 7 \ncompared with the winners in other areas with no such … protection. 8 \nSomehow, in strict logic, the shadow losses of long defunct automobile 9 \ncompanies would have to be subtracted from the profits of General Motors, 10 \nafter these in turn had been adjusted downward for the hypothetical 11 \ncompetition.56 12 \n  This is why neither Morin nor any other cost of capital expert uses or even evaluates Q- 13 \nratios in their cost of capital analyses. Morin’s invocation of the Q- ratio is a rhetorical red 14 \nherring; it has no relevance whatsoever to a utility’s cost of capital. Rather, as Kahn observed 15 \nmore than 50 years ago, for utilities the competitive result is revealed by an M/B ratio of 1.0. 16 \n  A simple thought experiment reveals why. It is a basic financial truism that paying more 17 \nfor a given stream of cash flows entails a lower return. For example, if I pay $100 for an 18 \nasset that returns $5 per year for 20 years plus my initial $100 investment at the end of year 19 \n20, my rate of return will be 5%. If I pay $150 for the same stream of cash flows (including 20 \nthe return of only $100 in year 20), my rate of return is reduced to 2%. 21 \n  Similarly, when investors buy a utility stock earning a 10% ROE at more than book 22 \nvalue, their expected return, i.e., their cost of equity, must  be less than 10%. The 23 \n“competitive result” is the lower return that investors are willing to accept. By itself, the M/B 24 \nratio cannot reveal that required rate of return. But it can tell us if the authorized ROE is 25 \nhigher or lower than the required return, the cost of equity; an M/B ratio of 1.0 tells us that 26 \nthe authorized ROE is equal to the COE, i.e., the “compet itive result” in the market for 27 \ncapital investment.  28 \n 55 Kahn, The Economics of Regulation: Principles and Institutions , p. 52-53.  \n 56 Kahn, The Economics of Regulation: Principles and Institutions , p. 53, fn. 81 (citing William G. \nShepherd & Thomas G.

Have any independent researchers examined the relationship between utilities’ cost of 10 \nequity and authorized ROEs?  11 \nA. Yes. At least two different research groups have investigated the relationship between 12 \nutilities’ cost of equity and authorized ROEs in the U.S. In a study published in 2019 13 \nexploring potential explanations, cited in my Phase 1 direct testimony,58 Carnegie Mellon 14 \nresearchers David Rode and Paul Fischbeck concluded: 15 \nIt would appear that regulators are authorizing excessive returns on equity to 16 \nutility investors and that these excess returns translate into tangible profits for 17 \nutility firms.  18 \n… 19 \nIn the end, we may observe simply that what regulators should do, what 20 \nregulators say  they’re doing, and what regulators actually  do may be three 21 \nvery different things.59 22 \n Although not independent, SCE witness Villadsen has nonetheless also alluded to this 23 \nregulatory say -do gap, noting, “ [A]ll regulators (say that they)  set the allowed return equal to 24 \nthe estimated cost of capital.”60 25 \n  In 2022, University of California, Berkeley researchers Karl Dunkle Werner and Stephen 26 \nJarvis similarly observed: 27 \n 57 Brealey, Myers, Allen, Principles of Corporate Finance, 10th edition ( 2011) , p. 866. \n 58 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 19-20.  \n 59 Rode, Fishchbeck, Regulated equity returns: A puzzle, Energy Policy 133 (2019), p. 1, 16 (emphasis \nin original).  \n 60 Brown, Villadsen, International Approaches to Regulated Rates of Return: A Review , The Brattle \nGroup (Sep. 16, 2020) p. 17 (emphasis added). \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nThe gap between the approved return on equity and other measures of the cost 1 \nof capital have [ sic] increased substantially over time.  2 \n… 3 \nOur analysis shows that the RoE that utilities are allowed to earn has changed 4 \ndramatically relative to various financial benchmarks in the economy.

Have the Utilities ever disclosed their internal assessments of their own cost of equity?  11 \nA. Yes. As explained in my Phase 1 rebuttal testimony, for each of the 4 years from 2016 to 12 \n2019, Sempra disclosed its internal estimate of its company- wide cost of equity in its SEC - 13 \nfiled annual proxy statement.62 Over that period, Sempra’s internally estimated COE was no 14 \nhigher than approximately 4%, substantially lower than the ROEs SDG&E  and SoCalGas 15 \nrequested over the same timeframe. Sempra’s overall risk profile was greater than the 16 \nSempra Utilities’, so there was no economic reason the Sempra Utilities’ COE w ould have 17 \nbeen  higher than Sempra’s.  18 \n 19 \nQ. What do you conclude from your findings regarding Sempra’s internal estimates of its 20 \ncost of equity?  21 \nA. Sempra executives maintained two inconsistent sets of cost of equity estimates. For the 22 \npurposes of determining their compensation, where a low value would serve their personal 23 \nfinancial interests, the estimated cost of equity was low. For the purposes of the 24 \nCommission’s cost of capital proceedings, where a high value would serve their personal 25 \nfinancial interests, the estimated cost of equity was more than 2.5 times as high.  26 \n 27 \n 61 See, e.g. , Karl Dunkle Werner and Stephen Jarvis, Rate of Return Regulation Revisited, Energy \nInstitute at Haas Working Paper 329 (2022), p. 14, 34-35, available at  https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp -\ncontent/uploads/WP329.pdf .  \n 62 Exhibit PCF- 02 (Ellis), p. 7 -10. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n5.

As explained in my Phase 1 direct testimony, the gap between authorized ROE and the cost 4 \nof equity has set in motion a cycle of upward spiraling growth in rate base and customer 5 \nrates, particularly in California.63 The California Utilities’ electric rates have been higher 6 \nthan the national average for many years, but in the last decade the difference between the 7 \nCalifornia Utilities and the rest of the country has widened considerably. As shown in Figure 8 \n4, an update of an analysis contained in my direct testimony, the percentage gap between 9 \neach of the California Utilities’ average residential electric rate and the national average 10 \n(with the national average rate equal to 0%)  continues to widen. While the California 11 \nUtilities’ residential electric rate premia ranged between 23% and 50% above the national 12 \naverage from 1990-2010, since then , the rate premia have ballooned to 89%-190% – nearly 13 \ndouble to triple the national average. 14 \n  Since 2010, the California Utilities’ residential electricity rates have grown at 2 -3 times 15 \nthe rate of inflation, while the average US residential electricity rate has declined by 1 % in 16 \nreal terms.64 In just the four  years since the last cost of capital proceeding, from 2019 to 17 \n2023, PG&E’s, SCE’s and SDG&E ’s residential rates have increased by 52 %, 86%, and 18 \n80%, respectively, compared to 23% for the industry overall and 19% for inflation.  19 \n 63 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 21 -25. \n 64 From 2010 through 202 3, cumulative inflation was 40%.

As explained in my Phase 1 direct testimony, t he executive management teams of the 7 \nCalifornia Utilities, like the leadership of all publicly traded companies, seek to maximize 8 \nshareholder value.66 The primary driver of the value of a utility stock is its expected future 9 \nearnings. Earnings, in turn, are directly linked to the authorized ROE. So the most 10 \nstraightforward way to sustain or increase a utility’s stock price is to sustain or increase its 11 \nROE.  12 \n  But the relationship between ROE and stock value is not linear, i.e., a 10% increase in 13 \nROE, from, say 10% to 11%, does not result in an increase in the stock price of 10%, but of 14 \n12% to 20%.67 So utility executives face strong incentives to keep ROEs as high as possible. 15 \n 65 2023 for January through October.

Do utility executive compensation plans contribute to this problem?  5 \nA. Yes. As explained in my Phase 1 direct and rebuttal testimony, a significant share of utility 6 \nexecutive compensation is tied to sustaining a high ROE and rate base growth – directly 7 \nthrough the earnings component of their annual performance-related bonuses, or indirectly 8 \nthrough their annual stock grants.68 For example, based on an updated analysis of Sempra’s 9 \n2022 executive compensation plans, the overall share of SDG&E  and SoCalGas officers’ 10 \nannual compensation that is tied to ROE and rate base growth ranges from approximately 11 \n40% to nearly 60%. For Sempra corporate officers, the range is approximately 65%- 85%.69 12 \n 13 Q. How have these dynamics played out, in terms of growth in rate base and customer 14 \nrates?  15 \nA. Figure 5  is an update, through 2022, of an analysis presented in my Phase 1 direct testimony 16 \nillustrating how these dynamics have played out for SDG&E  and SoCalGas.70 Since 2000, 17 \nwhile SDG&E ’s and SoCalGas’s total deliveries of electricity and natural gas have declined 18 \nby 30% and 21%, their rate bases have grown by factors of 6.1 x and 4.5x, respectively (3.6x 19 \nand 2.7x after adjusting for inflation). Net income has grown nearly in lockstep. On a per- 20 \nunit- delivered basis, SDG&E ’s and SoCalGas’s rate bases have grown by 8.6 and 5.7 times 21 \n(5.1x and 3.4x after adjusting for inflation).  22 \n  These figures reflect a capital inefficiency that is likely unmatched by any other industry 23 \nin the economy. High ROEs create the powerful incentives – directly through their impact on 24 \nearnings and indirectly through their non- linear effect on the stock price – that contribute to 25 \nthe rapid escalation of the California Utilities’ costs and rates over the past two decades.  26 \n 68 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 23-24; Exhibit PCF-02 (Ellis), p. 7 -10. \n 69 M.

THE COMMISSION SHOULD REQUIRE THE UTILITIES  TO PROVIDE 2 \nQUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE INTER- RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 3 \nROE AND CREDIT METRICS TO SUPPORT THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE 4 \nAND ROE PROPOSALS.  5 \nA. ROE and C apital S tructure Both Affect Credit Quality  and T herefore  6 \nCannot B e Determined Separately. 7 \nQ. How d oes capital structure impact customer costs?  8 \nA. Capital structure refers to the share of a utility’s investment that is funded by debt and equity. 9 \nBecause equity generally has a higher cost than debt, assuming no change in authorized 10 \nROE, a higher equity- to-total capital ratio (E/C) tends to increase customer costs.  Investors’ 11 \ninterest in a higher equity ratio, which increases their income, therefore conflicts with 12 \ncustomers’ interest in lower costs.  13 \n 14 Q. How d oes capital structure impact a utility’s credit quality?  15 \nA. A primary determinant of a company’s credit quality – its anticipated ability to repay its 16 \ndebts – is the amount of debt outstanding relative to the total amount of capital, both debt and 17 \nequity, invested in the company. In general, a higher equity ratio tends to improve a utility’s 18 \ncredit quality. Equity ratio is not the only determinant of credit quality, though. As will be 19 \nexplained in more detail below, credit quality is also determined by the amount of cash 20 \navailable to service the debt.  21 \n 22 \n1. ROE and capital structure interact to a ffect key credit metrics. 23 \nQ. Please explain the relationship between ROE and capital structure.  24 \nA. The direct testimony of SDG&E  witness Maritza Mekitarian, the company’s Director of 25 \nFinancial Planning, explains that cash flow is an important consideration in determining an 26 \nappropriate capital structure : 27 \nCredit metric guidance provided by the credit rating agencies is an important 28 \nguide to determining the appropriate amount and use of debt. The major credit 29 \nrating agencies commonly employ several key metrics to quantify financial 30 \nrisk, such as funds from operations (“FFO”) as a percent of total debt and debt 31 \nas a percentage of total capital. The FFO -to-Total Debt ratio measures funds 32 \nfrom operations as a percent of total debt. It indicates how much of its debt a 33 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\ncompany could retire with annual cash from operations. A higher figure 1 \nindicates a stronger ability to retire its debt, and thus lower financial risk. 2 \nTogether with their assessment of business risk and regulatory framework, the 3 \nmajor credit rating agencies use these financial metrics to help determine the 4 \ncredit ratings they assign.77 5 \n  Ms. Mekitarian  describes the importance of the ratio of cash flow – S&P’s FFO and 6 \nMoody’s ca sh flow from operations (CFO)78 – to debt in rating agencies’ assessments of 7 \nutility credit quality  and assignments of credit ratings . Indeed, cash flow- to-debt (CF/D)  is 8 \nthe primary metric the rating agencies use in assessing credit quality : it is the sole 9 \nquantitative metric mentioned among the factors that could lead to an upgrade or downgrade 10 \nin Moody’s Credit Opinions. Page 3 of Exhibit SDG&E-18-C, Moody’s June 23, 2022, 11 \nCredit Opinion for SDG&E , provides an example of these CF/D thresholds: 24% for an 12 \nupgrade to A2, 20% for a downgrade to Baa1 .79  13 \n  M s. Mekitarian  does not explain that net income is a key component of FFO and CFO.80 14 \nNet income, in turn, is the product of rate base, equity ratio, and ROE. Consequently, ROE 15 \nand equity ratio interact to determin e FFO  and CFO . In the context of the regulatory 16 \nobjective of setting a capital structure that appropriately balances customer and investor 17 \ninterests, as ROE increases, the amount of debt in the capital structure can also increase 18 \nwhile still maintaining the utility’s credit quality; similarly, as the ROE declines, the equity 19 \nratio would need to increase to maintain the same credit worthiness. 20 \n 21 \n2. Utilities should be required to  analyze quantitatively the interaction of 22 \nROE and capital structure i n their ROE and equity ratio  proposals. 23 \nQ. How do the Utilities determine their equity ratio proposals?  24 \nA. Most often, they simply calculate the average book -value equity ratio of the ROE proxy 25 \ngroup and perhaps adjust upward or downward to reflect utility- specific risks or other 26 \n 77 Exhibit SDG&E-02 (Mekitarian ), p. 3 -4. \n 78 Exhibit SDG&E-02 (Mekitarian ), p. 17.  \n 79 Exhibit SDG&E-18-C, p. 3 (Moody’s Investor Service Credit Opinion, San Diego Gas & Electric \nCompany Update to credit analysis (June 23 , 202 2)); see also  Exhibit SDG&E -02 (Mekitarian), p. \n17. \n 80 The basic definition of F FO (or CFO pre-WC) is net income + depreciation and amortization + \ndeferred taxes.

As a result, how much their proposed ROE 4 \nand/or the equity ratio could be modified to reduce customer costs while still maintaining 5 \ntheir desired investment -grade credit ratings cannot be assessed from their testimony. This is 6 \na significant , material oversight.  7 \n 8 \nQ. How should a utility’s capital structure be analyzed? 9 \nA. As the Moody’s Credit Opinion excerpt ed in Figure 7 demonstrates, credit rating agencies set 10 \nquantitative cash flow -to-debt thresholds that correspond to different credit ratings.  These 11 \nthresholds can be used to more rigorously determine the combination of eq uity ratio and 12 \nROE that optimally balances investor and customer interests.  13 \n  Figure 8 illustrates the relationships between equity ratio, ROE, and CF /D. The 14 \nhorizontal axis is the equity ratio; the vertical axis is  cash flow -to-debt. The light orange 15 \nhorizontal band represents the range of cash flow -to-debt that corresponds to the utility’s 16 \ndesired credit rating. The dark orange arcing lines correspond to different levels of authorized 17 \nROE, with increasing line thickness representing increasing ROE. Holding E/C  constant, 18 \nCF/D declines as ROE is reduced (moving down from a thicker ROE line to a thinner line). 19 \nBut the decline in CF /D when ROE is reduced can be reversed by increasing E/C  (moving 20 \nalong the thinner ROE line up and to the right). Any number of combinations of ROE and 21 \nE/C can meet the level of CF /D needed to maintain a utility’s credit rating. A higher ROE 22 \nrequires less equity to maintain the same CF /D and credit rating; a lower ROE can maintain 23 \nthe same FC/D and credit rating if it is paired with a higher E/C . 24 \n 81 Exhibit SDG&E -04 (Coyne), p. 66- 68. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nFigure 7 .

How does capital structure affect the cost of equity?  6 \nA. At any given ROE , a lower equity ratio tends to raise the cost  of equity. Similarly,  at any 7 \ngiven equity ratio, a lower  ROE also tends to  raise the cost of equity. This can be understood 8 \nintuitively. The cash generated by a business is pledged to holders of its debt and equity, with 9 \ndebtholders having first priority. As the equity ratio or ROE  declines, a smaller share of the 10 \ncash goes to equity owners. To the extent there is uncertainty in the total cash generated, it is 11 \namplified by a lower equity ratio  or ROE , increasing the risk of those cash flows. This 12 \nincreased risk is reflected in a higher cost of equity.  13 \n  Inevitably, the equity ratio s and ROEs of the companies selected for inclusion in rate of 14 \nreturn  proxy groups will vary . Their COEs will likewise vary and will only be applicable to 15 \ntheir specific equity ratios. The publicly-traded utility holding companies that are, of 16 \nnecessity,  used in proxy groups also often hold debt at the parent level , so their equity ratios 17 \nand COEs will not accurately reflect even those of their own utility subsidiaries. For these 18 \nreasons, t he resulting proxy group COEs must be a djusted to reflect differences in equity 19 \nratio.  20 \n 21 \n>>Increasing cash flow/debt>>\n>>Increasing equity ratio>>Target CF/D range\nDecreasing ROE\nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n1. COE estimate s should account  for differences in proxy group 1 \nmembers’ capital structure s. 2 \nQ. How should the proxy group COE estimates be adjusted for differences in capital 3 \nstructure? 4 \nA. Commonly used COE models produce levered costs of equity, i.e., the cost of equity when 5 \nthere is debt in the capital structure . To account for differences in capital structure among the 6 \nproxy group members, the levered COE results should be unlevered to estimate the cost of 7 \nequity assuming 100% equity financing.82 In the CAPM, the unlevered cost of equity, 𝑘𝑘 𝑢𝑢, is 8 \ntypically expressed as an adjustment to beta:  9 \n   𝑘𝑘𝑢𝑢=𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓+𝛽𝛽𝑢𝑢�𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓� 82F83 10 \n where the unlevered beta, 𝛽𝛽 𝑢𝑢, is expressed in terms of the levered equity beta, 𝛽𝛽 𝑒𝑒: 11 \n   𝛽𝛽𝑢𝑢=𝐸𝐸\n𝐷𝐷+𝐸𝐸𝛽𝛽𝑒𝑒83F84 12 \n  For co nsistency and comparability, the same methodology – unlevering relative to the 13 \nrisk-free rate, not the company’s cost of debt – should be applied to the MS DCF model 14 \nresults:  15 \n   𝑘𝑘𝑢𝑢=𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓+𝐸𝐸\n𝐷𝐷+𝐸𝐸𝛽𝛽𝑙𝑙�𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓� 16 \n   𝑘𝑘𝑒𝑒− 𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓=𝛽𝛽𝑙𝑙�𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓� 17 \n   𝑘𝑘𝑢𝑢=𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓+𝐸𝐸\n𝐷𝐷+𝐸𝐸�𝑘𝑘𝑒𝑒−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓� 18 \n   𝑘𝑘𝑢𝑢=𝐷𝐷\n𝐷𝐷+𝐸𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓+𝐸𝐸\n𝐷𝐷+𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘𝑒𝑒 19 \n where  𝐷𝐷 and 𝐸𝐸 refer to debt and equity, respectively. 20 \n 82 The unlevered cost of equity differs from the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”). The \nunlevered cost of capital assumes 100% equity financing; the WACC assumes the company’s current capital structure. While under the Modigliani and Miller theorem of  capital structure independence, \nthe cost of capital should be the same regardless of capital structure, the WACC typically overstates \nthe unlevered cost of equity because the expected return on corporate debt is lower than the yield due \nto default and liquidity risk. \n \n83 See, e.g., Aswath Damodaran, Damodaran on Valuation: Security Analysis for Investment and \nCorporate Finance  (2d ed. 2006) , p. 129. \n 84 Unlevered beta is sometimes adjusted for taxes (the “Hamada” adjustment). As explained in Valuation, when the capital structure is constant over time, as it is with utilities, then the value of tax \nshields tracks the value of operating assets. Thus, the risk of tax shields will mirror the risk of \noperating assets and have the same discount rate, i.e., the unlevered cost of equity. Damodaran , \nDamodaran on Valuation: Security Analysis for Investment and Corporate Finance  at 790-93.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  Best practice is to use market, not book, values for both debt and equity as market r eflects 1 \ninvestors’ actual exposure and expected returns; they buy and sell securities at market value, 2 \nnot book.85 Market values for the debt carried by proxy group members are not readily 3 \navailable, though, so book value is typically assumed.  4 \n  For illustrative purposes, Figure 9 shows the SDG&E  levered  COE results from my  5 \nPhase 1  direct testimony,86 along with their market equity ratios and unl evered COEs.  The 6 \nvariation in the unlevered COE estimates is much lower than in the levered COEs, with 7 \napproximately one- third the standard deviation (0.19 vs 0.45) and half the range (0.82 vs. 8 \n1.63). The underlying businesses of the proxy group members are very similar, so their risk 9 \nprofiles and corresponding overall costs of capital are expected to be similar, as well. Their 10 \nequity ratios vary considerably, though, from 41% to 75%, which introduces variation in 11 \ntheir levered costs of equity. This variation due to di fferences in equity ratios makes levered 12 \nCOEs an inappropriate basis for determining the ROE of the target company, which will 13 \nlikely have a different equity ratio.  14 \n 85 See, e.g. , Tim Koller et al., Valuation, McKinsey & Co.

For example, SDG&E  witness Mekitarian, 20 \nciting Moody’s June 23, 2022, Credit Opinion for SDG&E  claimed :89 21 \nMoody’s has explicitly stated that adopting SDG&E’s capital structure 22 \nproposal is credit supportive, which could reduce costs for ratepayers. 23 \n PG&E witness Margaret Becker, Vice President and Treasurer , similarly maintained :90 24 \nArtificially lowering the authorized ROE would actually harm customers in 25 \nthe long-term. Investors have choices about where to invest their capital. If the 26 \nCommission were to artificially reduce PG&E’s authorized ROE to address 27 \ncustomer affordability concerns, investors would attribute even more risk to 28 \n 89 Exhibit SDG&E-07 (Mekitarian ), p. 3. \n 90 Exhibit SDG&E -07 (Mekitarian) , p. 5.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nPG&E and invest elsewhere or require higher returns, which would ultimately 1 \nincrease customer cost.  2 \n  First of all, while Moody’s did say SDG&E ’s proposed capital structure would be credit 3 \nsupportive, Moody’s did not say SDG&E ’s proposed capital structure “could reduce costs for 4 \nratepayers.” “Credit supportive” by no means necessarily implies lower -cost for customers; 5 \noften, it’s just the opposite. A 25% ROE and 75% equity ratio would be “credit supportive” 6 \nbut would clearly increase customer costs.  7 \n  Witness Becker’s logic is similarly flawed. A ll else equal, a lower ROE would increase 8 \nthe risk of PG&E’s stock  and its cost of equity. But Ms. Becker seems not to understand that 9 \ncustomers don’t actually pay the cost of equity; t hey pay the authorized ROE. She conflates 10 \nthe two, seemingly assuming that PG&E’s cost of equity is automatically whatever PG&E 11 \nproposes for its ROE. T his type of nonsensical circular logic unfortunately plagues utilities’ 12 \nrationalizations for their ROR proposals.  13 \n  The regulator is obligated to minimize customer costs, not the risk in the utility’s stock 14 \nprice. If the utility’s proposed ROE is higher than its cost of equity, the regulator is obligated 15 \nto reduce it. All else equal, reducing the ROE  will increase the risk of the stock, but, as  I will 16 \nexplain in Section III.C.2 below , the regulator can optimize the ROE and equity ratio to 17 \nminimize customer costs while “dial ing in” any desired level of investor risk . 18 \n 19 \nQ. But could the ROE or equity ratio be reduced so much that the increases in the cost of 20 \nequity or cost of debt overwhelm the customer savings?  21 \nA. Instead of the Utilities ’ hand -wavy arguments, let’s look at examples using real data.  Figure 22 \n10 applies the analysis illustrated in Figure 8 to the financial data provided in Moody’s May 23 \n2022 C redit Update for SDG&E .91 As before in Figure 8, different levels of ROE are 24 \nrepresented by the upward curving lines. As the equity ratio increases along the horizontal 25 \naxis, so does the cash flow -to-debt ratio, depicted on the vertical axis. Two arcs are shown . 26 \nThe black arc correspond s to SDG&E ’s requested 10.55% ROE. The second, orange arc 27 \nreflects the ROE -equity ratio combinations that appropriately balance the consumer and 28 \n 91 Moody’s Investors Service, San Diego Gas & Electric Company: Update to credit analysis (June 23, \n2022 ). Data from Moody’s is used, not the financial data in SDG&E ’s regulatory filing, because \nMoody’s makes various adjustments to SDG&E ’s reported financials that are not explained in \nsufficient detail to replicate using SDG&E ’s data.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\ninvestor interests, with the ROE set equal to SDG&E ’s unlevered COE, 4.41% from Figure 9 1 \nabove, relevered  according to the formula discussed above. 2 \n  At SDG&E ’s proposed 10.55% ROE and 54% E/C (Scenario 1) , CF/D is 26.3%, well 3 \nabove the estimated 22% needed to sustain its then-current A3 rating, and sufficient to give it 4 \nan A1 rating.92 At SDG&E ’s proposed 10.55% ROE, its equity ratio could be as low as 5 \n48.9%, and it would still maintain the 2 2% CF/D required for an A3 rating  (Scenario 2) . 6 \nSimilarly, at SDG&E ’s proposed 54% E/C, its ROE could be as low as 7.4 6% and SDG&E  7 \nwould still maintain  an A3 rating  (Scenario 3). All three  of these ROE -equity ratio 8 \ncombinations are above the orange COE arc. T he ROE s are higher than the COE, in violation 9 \nof the ROR=COC standard , i.e., they would effect a wealth transfer from consumers to 10 \nshareholders . 11 \n  If instead we a dhere to the ROR=COC standard , to maintain  SDG&E ’s A3  credit rating  12 \nwith an ROE set equal to its cost of equity would require a 5 8.2% equity ratio  and 5.35% 13 \nROE  (Scenario 4). 14 \n 92 CF/D required to maintain A3 credit rating is estimated as the midpoint of the 20% downgrade and \n24% upgrade thresholds provided in in Moody’s June 2022 SDG&E  Credit Opinion . CF/D required \nto achieve A1 credit rating is estimated from Moody’s utility rating methodology ( Moody’s Investor \nService, Regulated Electric and Gas Utilities (June 23, 2017), p. 22, available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc -documents/68547\n). \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nFigure 9 .

What if SDG&E  wanted to improve its credit rating while still adhering to the 4 \nROR=COC standard? What would be the trade -off for customers?  5 \nA. An improved credit rating would be equivalent to moving up and to the right along the 6 \norange arc in Figure 10, to Scenario 5. The two most material implications would be a higher 7 \nequity ratio, 60.7%, and a lower ROE, 5.26%.  8 \n 9 \nQ. All of these scenarios reduce CF/D. How would the  cost of debt be affected ? 10 \nA. The cost of debt would increase modestly.

Based on SDG&E ’s 6 \nembedded cost of debt analysis, new debt accounts for 19% of the total, so SDG&E ’s 7 \naverage cost of debt would change by only 19% of the change in SDG&E ’s marginal cost of 8 \nnew debt. 9 \n 10 \nQ. How do es the customer benefit of a lower ROE compare to the cost of a higher equity 11 \nratio  and higher cost of debt relative to SDG&E ’s proposal? 12 \nA. The benefits and costs of different ROE -equity ratio combinations can be compared by 13 \nlooking at  the combined rate of return , the weighted average of equity and debt, grossed-up 14 \nfor the income taxes that are passed through to customers (“customer ROR”), shown in 15 \nFigure 12. 16 \n  For an apples- to-apples comparison with SDG&E ’s proposal, SDG&E ’s embedded cost 17 \nof debt, 3.87%, is adjusted by 19% of the difference in the March 2022 interest rates 18 \ncorresponding to the various credit ratings assumed in the s cenarios in Figure 10. For 19 \nexample,  the March 2022 rate corresponding to SDG&E ’s proposed 26.3% CF/D is 3.98%, 20 \n 94 S&P GMI data, available at  https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/  [last accessed Jan 21, \n2024].  10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%\n3.7%3.8%3.9%4.0%4.1%4.2%4.3%4.4%\nAA/Aa2 AA-/Aa3 A+/A1 A/A2 A-/A3 BBB+/Baa1 BBB/Baa2\nCash flow -to-debt (CF/D)Cost of debt (COD)\nS&P/Moody's credit ratingCF/D\nCOD\nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nand the March 2022 rate corresponding to Scenarios 2-4 ( A3, 22% CF/D)  is 4.11%, or 0.13% 1 \nhigher. In Scenarios 2 -4 SDG&E ’s marginal cost of debt is estimated as 3.87% + 0.1 3% = 2 \n4.00%, and its embedded cost of debt is estimated as 0.19 x 4.00% + 0.81 x 3.87% = 3.90%. 3 \n  For each scenario, Figure 12 calculates the COD and corresponding ROR and customer 4 \nROR under more conservative assumptions. The “100%” assumption sets SDG&E ’s 5 \nembedded COD equal to the marginal COD ; this is intended to reflect the long -term impact 6 \nof a change in SDG&E ’s credit rating . The “M aximum”  assumption also sets the embedded 7 \nCOD equal to the marginal COD.  In addition, Maximum assumes the marginal COD is equal 8 \nto SDG&E ’s embedded COD plus the credit adjustment from the historical month  9 \n(December 2008)  in which credit spread s wer e the highest recorded since 1992, averaging 10 \n0.37% per notch, roughly 4x the historical average – an extremely conservative case for 11 \nassessing how  erosion in credit quality might affect customer costs . 12 \n  Scenario 2  demonstrates that, even if we accept that SDG&E ’s proposed ROE reflects its 13 \ntrue cost of equity – although we should be skeptical, given that it was developed without 14 \nany consideration of credit metrics – scope exists for a lower equity ratio , 48.9%,  to reduce 15 \nthe tax -affected customer ROR by 5.4% without jeopardizing SDG&E ’s current credit.  16 \nFigure 12 also shows the impact of the various scenarios on  SDG&E ’s total revenue (or 17 \naverage customer rate) , under “ΔSDG&E .” Under SDG&E ’s proposal, the customer cost of 18 \ncapital – interest, net income, income tax – accounts for 27.5% of total revenue, so a 5.4% 19 \nreduction in customer ROR would reduce customer costs by 1.5%.  20 \n  Reducing the ROE to the minimum required to maintain an A3 credit rating at a 54% E/C  21 \n(Scenario 3) would produce substantially more savings: 23.6% in customer ROR and 6.5% of 22 \ntotal customer costs.  Adhering to the ROR =COC standard at SDG&E ’s current A3 credit 23 \nrating  (Scenario 4) produces even more savings , 38.3% in customer ROR and 10.6% of total 24 \ncustomer costs.  Scenarios 3 and 4 demonstrate that, in general, reducing the ROE, even if it 25 \nrequires a higher equity ratio, is a much more effective way to reduce customer costs than 26 \nreducing the equity ratio.  27 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nFigure 11.

The difference in customer costs is negligible 7 \nunder the Embedded and 100% COD assumptions  (0.1% of revenue) but are more substantial 8 \nunder the Maximum assumption (0.4% of revenue ). This demonstrates that in times of 9 \nmarket turmoil, like during the financial crisis in 2008 -09, there is some benefit to customers 10 \nof a higher credit rating.  11 \n  Nonetheless, the difference in the customer ROR under even  Maximum assumptions is 12 \nonly 0.14% (6. 03% for A 3 vs. 5.89% for A2).  This result is consistent with the Modigliani 13 \nand Miller theorem of capital structure independence, which states that the cost of capital 14 \nshould be the same regardless of capital structure. 15 \n  It should be kept in mind that all scenarios along the orange arc are calculated to ensure 16 \nthey provide sufficient return to satisfy the interests of both debt and equity investors. 17 \n 95 Based on an income tax rate of 24.8% from A.22-05- 015/016, Exhibit SDG&E -44-R, Prepared Direct \nTestimony of Ryan Hom – Summary of Earnings (August 2022), Appendix B, Table RH -1. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nScenarios above the orange arc, such as SDG&E ’s proposal or even reductions in ROE or 1 \nE/C that aren’t simultaneously optimized, fail to properly balance the customer and investor 2 \ninterests and needlessly transfer wealth from customers to investors.  3 \n 4 \n2.

What does your analysis tell us about the trade- offs between ROE, equity ratio, the cost 7 \nof debt, and customer ROR?  8 \nA. At typical utility credit ratings, savings from a lower ROE, after grossing up for taxes, 9 \ngenerally more than make up for the incremental cost of any additional equity required in the 10 \ncapital structure , or any additional interest costs arising from a lower credit rating . Figure 13 11 \ncompares SDG&E ’s incremental customer cost , in billions of dollars, of debt and equity 12 \nunder Scenarios 2- 5 relative to SDG&E ’s proposal. Under no scenario does the incremental 13 \ncost of debt, if there is any, outweigh the savings from a lower ROE or lower equity ratio.  In 14 \nthe two ROE=COE scenarios the customer costs of both debt and equity are reduced under 15 \nall but the Maximum assumptions.  16 \nFigure 12.

For example, net income accounts for about 50% of SDG&E ’s cash 1 \nflow; other items, such as depreciation, amortization, and deferred taxes, account for the rest. 2 \nConsequently, a relatively large reduction in net income due to a sharp cut in ROE would 3 \nreduce cash flow by only half as much in percentage terms. In addition, ROE is grossed-up 4 \nfor taxes, which are not included in FFO and CFO, so the savings to customers from a lower 5 \nROE are amplified. Rather than “lever up,” i.e., reduce the equity ratio and increase debt, it is 6 \noften more cost -effective to use any spare credit capacity to reduce the utility’s ROE, or even 7 \nto increase the equity ratio if necessary to maintain a target credit rating, than to increase 8 \ndebt. 9 \n  Reducing ROE and increasing the equity ratio has the additional benefit of reducing debt- 10 \nto-capitalization, the key metric used by rating agencies to assess credit quality identified in 11 \nMs. Mekitarian’s testimony.96 12 \n 13 \nQ. The integrated analysis you propose sounds complicated. Is it reasonable to expect 14 \nutilities, PUC staff, and intervenors to learn how to do it?  15 \nA. I have a few thoughts about this. 16 \n  First, the  analysis is much simpler than it might seem – a relatively small spreadsheet 17 \nmodel in comparison to what utilities commonly prepare for a rate case and their cost of 18 \ncapital experts use in preparing their testimony. The Utilities are already intimately familiar 19 \nwith these types of analyses; I worked in a utility, which is where I learned it.  I can tell you  20 \nfrom that experience that each of their CFOs watch es their cash  flow -to-debt ratio like a 21 \nhawk, because it’s the key metric the rating agencies care about. Although the ROE (levered 22 \nCOE) and equity ratio models are integrated, the unlevered cost of equity calculation is 23 \nseparate and entails only one additional calculation step than a conventional COE analysis.  24 \n  Second, as I will explain in Sections IV  and VI below , I recommend eliminating several 25 \ncommon, but flawed and therefore unnecessary,  COE -related analyses, which would 26 \nsignificantly reduce the amount of time, effort, and resources required of all the parties in a 27 \nCOC proceedings. 28 \n 96 Exhibit SDG&E -02 (Mekitarian) , p. 4.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  Third, greater financial sophistication and more explicit, quantitative assessment  of 1 \nfinancial matters among regulators and intervenors would be reassuring to both investors and 2 \nthe public that their respective interests were being appropriately considered and balanced. 3 \n  Fourth, and perhaps most important, the foregoing analysis demonstrates the tremendous 4 \ncustomer value at stake in getting the COC right: in excess of 10% of Utilities’ requested 5 \nrevenue, billions of dollars a year across the entire state. PUC staff and intervenors would be 6 \nremiss not to invest the ir time and energy to develop the financial acumen to better 7 \nunderstand these basic inter- relationships between capital structure, credit ratings, and the 8 \ncost of equity, and to acquire the analytical skills to  better scrutinize the U tilities’ proposals.  9 \n  Businesspeople often refer to ROI  – return on investment. The incremental cost of 10 \ndeveloping and deploying this expertise would likely be on the order of $1 million per year, 11 \nperhaps just a fraction of that. The savings to California utility customers would be in the 12 \nbillions of dollars per year – more than a 1,000x ROI. I can guarantee acquiring such 13 \nfinancial expertise  is the absolute last investment utility executives want the regulatory and 14 \nintervenor community to make – which is a sure sign it is the first one they should make.  15 \n 16 \nQ. Please summarize why the Commission should jointly analyze ROE and capital 17 \nstructure.  18 \nA. Utilities commonly  maintain that any reduction in their ROE will negatively impact their 19 \ncredit rating and increase their cost of debt and therefore customer costs.97 Despite lengthy 20 \ndiscussion of the potential directional  impact of a lower  ROE or equity ratio on their credit 21 \nrating, they fail to provide any analysis that quantifies  either the trade -off between ROE and 22 \nCOD or how the equity ratio can be adjusted to accommodate a lower ROE to reduce 23 \ncustomer costs and meet  equity investor expectations while maintaining the utility’s target 24 \ncredit rating.98 25 \n  The Commission should require utilities to provide such analysis in justifying their ROE 26 \nand capital structured proposals. As the foregoing analysis demonstrates, the potential 27 \n 97 See, e.g. , Exhibit SDG&E -08 (Coyne), p. 4-5 (“All models are subject to certain limiting \nassumptions. However, in market conditions where ROE estimation models are producing return \nestimates as low as the current cost of debt (e.g., Mr. Ellis’ CAPM), utility regulators recognize that \nsuch low retur ns are not compensatory for investors .”). \n 98 See, e.g. , Exhibit SDG&E -04 (Coyne), p. 66-68.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nsavings to customers from optimizing the ROE and capital structure are  significant – more 1 \nthan 10% of total customer costs. Given th e value at stake, the utilities’ clear familiarity with 2 \nthe relevant financial concepts , the simplicity of the analysis  (easily performed with a small 3 \nspreadsheet model), and the ready availability of the required data, there is no reason not to 4 \nrequire more rigorous, quantitative justification of utilities’ ROE and capital structure 5 \nproposals. 6 \n 7 \n 8 IV. THE COMMISSION SHOULD PROHIBIT USE OF THE FLAWED RISK 9 \nPREMIUM MODEL BECAUSE THE MODEL’S CIRCULARITY AND USE OF 10 \nHISTORICAL AUTHORIZED ROEs RENDER THE  MODEL UNRELIABLE 11 \nAND INAPPROPRIATE FOR USE IN COST OF CAPITAL PROCEEDINGS . 12 \nQ. Are all the models used to determine the rate of return in utility regulatory proceedings 13 \nwidely accepted and used in finance?  14 \nA. No. Several of the models that are commonly used to determine the rate of return in utility 15 \nregulatory proceedings are not commonly used by financial practitioners or researchers. 16 \nThese include the Risk Premium Model (RPM ), the Expected Earnings Analysis (EEA) , and 17 \nthe Empirical CAPM  (ECAPM) .\n99 18 \n 19 \nQ. Why are these models not used elsewhere in finance?  20 \nA. The reasons these models are not commonly used elsewhere in finance vary. The RPM and 21 \nEEA are not used elsewhere because they do not actually estimate a cost of capital . The RPM 22 \nis a regression model of past regulatory ROE decisions, which may or may not reflect the 23 \nactual cost of capital . All three of the Utilities’ cost of capital experts use it.100 The EEA is 24 \ndescribed in SDG&E  witness Coyne’s Phase 1 direct testimony.101 It is based on estimates of 25 \nfuture returns on book value, but investors are rarely able to purchase stock at book value; 26 \nthey must pay the market price, so the return on book value almost never reflects investors’ 27 \nexpected return. 28 \n 99 The RPM is sometimes referred to as the “Risk Premium Analysis”; EEA, “Expected Earnings \nModel.”  \n 100 Exhibit PG&E -01 (Vilbert), p. 2- 53-55 ; Exhibit SCE- 02 (Villadsen), p. 49 -52; Exhibit SDG&E -04 \n(Coyne), p. 42-45. \n 101 Exhibit SDG&E -04 (Coyne), p. 45- 47. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  The ECAPM is intended to estimate the cost of equity but is conceptually flawed. It was 1 \ndeveloped by utility cost of capital practitioners for use solely in utility cost of capital 2 \nproceedings based on a flawed interpretation of academic research. I will discuss the 3 \nECAPM in more detail in Section VII.G below . 4 \n 5 \nQ. Why are models based on ROE, not COE, a problem?  6 \nA. As explained above, the entire purpose of a cost of capital proceeding is just that, to 7 \ndetermine the cost of capital. There is substantial and robust evidence that past regulatory 8 \nROE decisions do not reflect the cost of capital but have, in fact, far exceeded the cost of 9 \ncapital. Basing future ROE decisions on historical authorized ROE s simply perpetuates these 10 \nerrors. Looking at actual  authorized ROEs to estimate the required  COE is akin to 11 \ndeveloping a diet recommendation based on what people actually  eat, not what they should 12 \neat to be healthy. 13 \n 14 Q. Have any regulatory authorities recognized these flaws with the RPM?  15 \nA. Yes. FERC has specifically ruled out these models for use in rate of return proceedings.  In 16 \nOpinion No. 569 (November 2019), FERC rejected the use of the RPM to estimate the cost 17 \nof equity:  18 \n[T]he Risk Premium model is likely to provide a less accurate current cost of 19 \nequity estimate than the DCF model or CAPM because it relies on previous 20 \nROE determinations, whose resulting ROE may not necessarily be directly 21 \ndetermined by a market -based method, whereas the DCF and CAPM methods 22 \napply a market-based method to primary data. For example, previous ROE 23 \ndeterminations may not involve an explicit determination as to whether an 24 \nROE is just and reasonable, but instead focused on whether to allow an ROE 25 \nincentive adder or were approving a preexisting RTO- wide ROE for a new 26 \nRTO member. Similarly, many previous ROE determinations used in the Risk 27 \nPremium model were the product of rate case settlements. Such settlements 28 \noften involve compromises on a variety of issues present in a rate case, of 29 \nwhich the appropriate ROE is only one. Consequently, such settlements could 30 \ninclude ROEs that are not representative of the market cost of equity because 31 \nthe ROEs were negotiated above or below that market cost of equity in order 32 \nto form an overall settlement package, together with negotiated outcomes on 33 \nother issues, that were acceptable to the parties.  34 \n 35 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nWhile all models, including the DCF, feature some circularity, such circularity 1 \nis particularly direct and acute with the Risk Premium model because it 2 \ndirectly relies on  past Commission ROE decisions. MISO TOs’ regression 3 \nanalysis, discussed below,  accentuates such circularity by largely offsetting 4 \nthe effects of changes in interest rates.  As a result, we share the concerns 5 \nexpressed by various parties that the circularity  inherent in the Risk Premium 6 \nmodel’s use of prior ROE determinations would largely  continue previously- 7 \napproved ROEs and reflect past circumstances that influenced the previous 8 \nROE decisions.  9 \n… 10 \nAdditionally, the record contains insufficient evidence to conclude that 11 \ninvestors  rely on risk premium analyses utilizing historic Commission ROE 12 \ndeterminations or settlement approvals to determine the cost of capital and 13 \nmake investment decisions.  Investors certainly observe regulatory ROEs and 14 \nhow changes in authorized ROE levels could affect utility earnings, but such 15 \nconsiderations differ from the type of analyses employed by the MISO TOs 16 \nlooking back at past decisions to determine the current cost of capital. We 17 \nrecognize that academic literature discusses this methodology, but the record 18 \nindicates the greater prevalence of other methods.102 19 \n  Although FERC subsequently reinstated the RPM in Opinion No. 569-A (May 2020), in 20 \nAugust of 2022 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held 21 \nthat FERC’s reinstatement of the RPM was arbitrary and capricious and has vacated Opinion 22 \n569-A, citing “‘particularly direct and acute’ circularity problems.”103 23 \n  I agree with the D.C.

Did FERC find similar flaws with any other commonly used models?  4 \nA. Yes. FERC similarly rejected the Expected Earnings Analysis in Opinion No. 569 and 5 \naffirmed its decision in Opinion No. 575 (May 2021): 6 \nIn Opinion No. 569, the Commission explained that, under the Commission’s 7 \nmarket- based approach, the Commission set a utility’s ROE at the estimated 8 \nreturn that investors would require in order to purchase stock in the utility at 9 \nits current market price. In Hope , the Supreme Court explained that “the 10 \nreturn to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on 11 \ninvestments in other enterprises having corresponding risks.” The 12 \nCommission stated that, in order to determine this, the Commission must 13 \nanalyze the returns that are earned on “investments in other enterprises having 14 \ncorresponding risks.” However, investors cannot invest in an enterprise at 15 \nbook value and must instead pay the prevailing market price for an 16 \nenterprise’s equity. As a result, the Commission states that the expected return 17 \non a utility’s book value does not reflect “returns on investments in other 18 \nenterprises” because book value does not reflect the value of any investment 19 \nthat is available to an investor in the market, outside of th e unlikely situation 20 \nin which market value and book value are exactly equal. Accordingly, we 21 \nagree with Trial Staff, PUCT, and New Orleans Council and we continue to 22 \nfind that the Expected Earnings model is not a market- based model and 23 \nrelying on it does not satisfy the requirements of Hope .115 24 \n  I recommend the Commission adopt FERC’s prohibitions on use of the Expected 25 \nEarnings Analysis.  26 \n 27 \n114  Exhibit PCF-02 (Ellis) , p. 5 -6, l. 7 -4 [testifying that some intervenors used Risk Premium and \nExpected Earnings models “which are based, respectively, on historical authorized and forecast ROEs \nand make no reference at all to the cost of equity”].  \n 115 Order No. 575, 70 FERC ¶ 61,022, p. 92.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nVI. WHEN UTILIZING THE DCF MODEL, THE COMMISSION SHOULD 1 \nPROHIBIT PARTIES FROM PROJECTING  ANALYSTS’ 3 -TO-5-YEAR 2 \nGROWTH FORECASTS INTO PERPETUITY. 3 \nQ. Please describe the version of the DCF model  that is commonly implemented 4 \nincorrectly in utility regulatory proceedings . 5 \nA. As explained in my Phase 1 direct testimony, one of the most widely used methods used to 6 \ndetermine the ROE in utility regulatory proceedings is the constant -growth discounted cash 7 \nflow model (CG DCF).116 It is also commonly implemented with unrealistic assumptions.  8 \n  The CG DCF  is based on the well -known and widely used mathematical formula for the 9 \nvalue of a growing perpetuity str eam of cash flows. It assumes a single, constant rate of cash 10 \nflow growth. In the CG DCF model commonly used in utility ROR analyses, the cash flows 11 \nare expected dividends, and the perpetuity value formula can be expressed as: 12 \n𝑀𝑀0=𝐷𝐷0(1 +𝑔𝑔)\n(𝑘𝑘−𝑔𝑔 ) 13 \n where 𝑀𝑀 0 refers to the current market value (stock price), 𝐷𝐷0, the current dividend (typically 14 \nfour times the most recent quarterly payment), 𝑔𝑔, the forecast perpetuity growth rate, and 𝑘𝑘 , 15 \nthe cost of equity. Rearranging terms, the cost of equity can be expressed as a function of the 16 \ndividend yield, 𝑑𝑑  (𝑀𝑀0\n𝐷𝐷0), and growth rate:  17 \n𝑘𝑘=𝑑𝑑(1 +𝑔𝑔)+𝑔𝑔 18 \n Typically, the cost of equity is estimated for each member of the proxy group, with the mean 19 \nor median reflecting the cost of equity for the tar get company. 20 \n  The general DCF model, which can allow for varying growth rates over time, is a 21 \nparticularly apt representation of stock returns because its assumptions realistically reflect 22 \nseveral key features of share prices and expected returns. First, the DCF model’s perpetual 23 \ncash flow stream assumption mirrors equity’s claim on a firm’s cash flows into perpetuity. 24 \nSecond, the assumption of steady growth in dividends over time reasonably reflects their 25 \nmuch greater stability relative to other potential measures of profitability, like earnings or 26 \ncash flow. Third, the resulting single discount rate into perpetuity is consistent with the no- 27 \narbitrage principle of finance.  28 \n 116 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 34-36. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  If investors expected higher (lower) returns in the future, they would impute that into the 1 \nprice today and bid up (down) the price accordingly, such that near-term and long- term 2 \nreturns roughly equilibrate.117 3 \n 4 \nQ. How are the input assumptions to the CG DCF model estimated?  5 \nA.  E stimating the current dividend yield is fairly straightforward , typically 4 times the most 6 \nrecent quarterly dividend divided by the recent stock price. E stimating a dividend-per- share 7 \n(DPS) growth rate that is valid into perpetuity is more subjective. Cost of capital and 8 \nvaluation practitioners commonly use equity analysts’ growth rate forecasts as an input to 9 \ntheir DCF models. D ue to data availability limitations – DPS forecasts are much less 10 \ncommon than earnings -per-share (EPS) forecasts – practitioners often use forecast EPS 11 \ngrowth rates as a proxy for DPS growth. 12 \n 13 Q. What is the most critical common  flaw in the implementation of the CG DCF model to 14 \nestimate the COE in utility regulatory proceedings?  15 \nA. The most critical common  flaw in the implementation of the CG DCF is the assumption that 16 \nanalysts’ EPS growth forecasts are valid into perpetuity. This assumption is not reasonable. 17 \nThe results of the CG DCF are particularly sensitive to the perpetuity growth rate 18 \nassumption. The inaccuracy introduced by assuming a relatively short- term growth rate will 19 \nbe sustained forever therefore invalidates the results of the CG DCF as commonly 20 \nimplemented using analysts’ EPS growth forecasts. 21 \n 22 \n 117 Some equity return projections vary with forecast horizon, generally due to a valuation-reversion \nassumption in the model, e.g., price -to-earnings ratios returning to their long-term historical average \nover an initial horizon and remaining at that level afterward. See, e.g., BlackRock’s capital market \nassumptions , available at  https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en -us/insights/charts/capital -\nmarket -assumptions . Whether variation in expected equity returns across different forecast horizons \ncan be estimated with any accuracy is a subject of ongoing debate among academic and investment \nprofessionals. Some forecasters assume no mean reversion in their return forecasts. See, e.g.,  AQR \nCapital Management, 2014 Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes  (1Q 2014) , \navailable at  https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Alternative -Thinking/2014 -Capital -Market -\nAssumptions -for-Major -Asset -Classes . \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nQ. How do we know assuming analysts’ EPS growth forecasts are valid into perpetuity is  1 \nunreasonable.  2 \nA. I provide several reasons this assumption is unreasonable in my Phase 1 direct testimony, but 3 \ntwo are especially determinative.118 4 \n 5 \nQ. What is the first determinative reason i t is un reasonable to assume that a utility will 6 \nmaintain its current 3 -to-5-year forecast growth rate into perpetuity ? 7 \nA. The most obvious reason is that analysts’ “long- term” forecast  horizons are  not long- term at 8 \nall, especially relative to the infinite forecast horizon required by the CG DCF. Among the 9 \nmost commonly used analyst growth rates, the forecast horizons are 3 to 5 years for S&P and 10 \nZacks; 5 years for Bloomberg and Yahoo! Finance; and 6 years for ValueLine.119 11 \n 12 Q. What is the second determinative reason it is unreasonable to assume that a utility will 13 \nmaintain its current 3 -to-5-year forecast growth rate into perpetuity?  14 \nA. The second determinative reason it is unreasonable to assume analysts’ growth forecasts into 15 \nperpetuity is because decades  of academic research has consistently found that analyst 16 \nforecasts tend to be upwardly biased.\n120 17 \n  The unreasonableness of extrapolating analysts’ upwardly biased growth rates into 18 \nperpetuity is perhaps most compellingly  demonstrated by its economically impossible 19 \nimplications.

Have other cost of capital experts acknowledged the unreasonableness of assuming 1 \nanalyst growth rates into perpetuity in the CG DCF model?  2 \nA. Yes. Utility cost of capital experts have also acknowledged the potential unreasonableness of 3 \nassuming analyst growth rates into perpetuity in the CG DCF model.  4 \n  SDG&E  witness Coyne, for example, testified  in a recent rate case, “the Multi -Stage 5 \nDCF can be used when there is concern that short- term growth rates may not be sustainable 6 \nover the longer -term.”124 7 \n  Similarly, SCE witness Villadsen has cited a similar critique, from the Research 8 \nFoundation of CFA Institute, of projecting analysts’ estimates beyond their forecast horizon:  9 \n[C]onsensus long- term earnings growth estimates routinely exceed sustainable 10 \nGDP growth. The current consensus growth rate for earnings on the S&P 500, 11 \naccording to the Zacks Investment Research survey, is 10 percent, which, if 12 \nwe assume a consensus inflation expectation of 2 -3 percent, corresponds to 7- 13 \n8 percent real growth. Real earnings growth of 8 percent is six times the real 14 \nearnings growth of the past century, however, and three times the consensus 15 \nlong- term GDP growth rate. This growth is not possib le.125 16 \n  Roger Morin has also  acknowledged the unreasonableness of extrapolating analyst 17 \ngrowth forecasts into perpetuity, explain ing: 18 \nAlthough the constant-growth DCF model does have a long history, analysts, 19 \npractitioners, and academics have come to recognize that it is not applicable in 20 \nmany situations. A multiple- stage DCF model that better mirrors the pattern of 21 \nfuture dividend growth is preferable. … The problem is that . . . from the 22 \nstandpoint of the DCF model that extends into perpetuity, analysts’ horizons 23 \nare too short, typically five years. It is often unrealistic for such growth to 24 \ncontinue into perpetuity.  … It is useful to remember that eventually all 25 \ncompany growth rates, especially utility services growth rates, converge to a 26 \nlevel consistent with the growth rate of the aggregate economy.126 27 \n 28 \n 124 New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board Docket No. 491, Liberty Utilities (Gas New Brunswick), \nPrepared Direct Testimony: James M.

Are there other concerns with extrapolating analysts’ 3 -to-5-year EPS forecasts into 1 \nperpetuity?  2 \nA. In my Phase 1 testimony, I identified several other concerns with using analyst EPS growth 3 \nforecasts in the DCF  including:127 4 \n• Low correlation between analysts’ EPS and DPS growth forecasts, due to the much 5 \ngreater volatility of earnings relative to dividends; 6 \n• Unknown starting period for analyst growth forecasts and therefore likely inconsistency 7 \nwith the DCF model’s assumed starting period, the date the dividend yield is calculated; 8 \n• Inconsistency between the CG DCF results and analysts’ own implied expected return 9 \nestimates;  10 \n• Wide disparity between analyst forecasts and utilities’ long -term historical DPS growth 11 \nrates; and  12 \n• Wide disparity in model results across proxy group members that should, in principle, 13 \nhave similar costs of equity . 14 \n For all of these reasons, judgment and caution shou ld be exercised in using analysts’ EPS 15 \ngrowth forecasts in DCF models . Unequivocally, analysts’ EPS growth forecasts  should not 16 \nbe used as-is in the constant- growth DCF model. 17 \n 18 \nQ. Should the Commission rule out the use of the CG DCF completely?  19 \nA. The CG DCF is a valid and widely used financial model, and it could, in principle, be used to 20 \nestimate the cost of equity . It is possible to implement the CG DCF with realistic perpetuity 21 \ngrowth assumptions, so there’s no reason to prohibit its use completely. Nonetheless, its  22 \ninput assumptions should be scrutinized for their validity over the discounting horizon and 23 \neconomic reasonableness, and the resulting COE estimates should be benchmarked against 24 \nthird -party, objective  references. 25 \n  More generally, discounted cash flow models can be a robust approach to estimating 26 \nexpected returns and are widely used throughout finance. The key shortcoming of the CG 27 \nDCF – assuming a relatively short- term growth rate into perpetuity – can be easily remedied 28 \nby assuming that analysts’ estimated growth rates apply only for a limited period, after which 29 \n 127 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis) , p. 32-77.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nthey converge toward a market- or sector -average terminal growth rate in a multi- stage DCF 1 \nmodel (MS DCF). Despite the various deficiencies in analysts’ e stimates even in the short - 2 \nterm, they are viewed as the best available estimates of near -term investor expectations. That 3 \nsaid, relatively little weight should be placed on them in estimating the cost of equity, and the 4 \nMS DCF can weight them more appropriately. 5 \n 6 \n 7 VII. WHEN UTILIZING  THE CAPM , THE COMMISSION SHOULD PROHIBIT 8 \nPARTIES FROM INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS, DATA SOURCES, AND 9 \nMODIFICATIONS THAT LACK CONCEPTUAL OR EMPIRICAL VALIDITY.  10 \nQ. Please provide an overview of the CAPM.  11 \nA. As explained in my Phase 1 direct testimony, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), 12 \nexpresses the COE in terms of the fundamental financial risk -reward trade -off: investors 13 \ndemand higher returns as risk increases.  The CAPM estimates the cost of equity , 𝑘𝑘, from the 14 \nformula:  15 \n𝑘𝑘=𝑟𝑟\n𝑓𝑓+𝛽𝛽�𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓� 16 \n where 𝑟𝑟 𝑓𝑓 is the risk -free rate (typically a long -term US Treasury  bond), 𝑟𝑟 𝑚𝑚 is the expected 17 \nreturn on the market, and 𝛽𝛽  is a measure of risk of the company in question relative to the 18 \nmarket.128 19 \n  It is common practice in utility regulatory proceedings to estimate a long- term cost of 20 \nequity. This is an implicit assumption in the CG DCF. For consistency, the CAPM is 21 \ntypically used to estimate a long -term COE. The 30 -year is the longest -term Treasury and is 22 \ncommonly used in the CAPM. 23 \n  The market risk premium (MRP), the difference between the market return and the risk - 24 \nfree rate, 𝑟𝑟 𝑚𝑚−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓, reflects the additional return investors require as compensation for taking 25 \non equity market risk.  26 \n 27 \n 128 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 50 -51. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nQ. Do you have concerns with how the CAPM is frequently  implemented in utility ROR 1 \nproceedings?  2 \nA. Yes. I n my Phase 1 direct testi mony, I i dentified a number of common implementation errors 3 \nin all three of the CAPM’s assumptions, as well as in a commonly used variation on the 4 \nCAP M known as the Empirical CAPM (ECAPM).129 These common errors include: 5 \n• Forecast, not current, risk-free rate;  6 \n• Uncritical acceptance and use of a single source for beta;  7 \n• Adjusted beta; 8 \n• CG DCF  and/or a forecast risk -free rate to estimate a forward -looking MRP;  9 \n• Income-only, not total, bond returns to estimate a historical MRP; 10 \n• Arithmetic, not geometric, returns to estimate a historical MRP;  and 11 \n• Emp irical CAPM (ECAPM).  12 \n All of these common implementation practices are flawed and should be prohibited by the 13 \nCommission.  I have developed seven specific recommendations to address each of these 14 \ncommon implementation errors.  15 \n 16 \nA. The Commission Should Require Parties to Utilize the Current  Risk -Free 17 \nRate , Not F orecast R isk-Free Rates. 18 \nQ. What is your first recommendation, regarding the risk -free rate assumption?  19 \nA. I recommend the Commission prohibit the use of a forecast risk -free rate and require the use 20 \nof the current rate.  21 \n 22 \nQ. What is the rationale for prohibiting use of a forecast rate? 23 \nA. As explained in my Phase 1 direct testimony, I have two concerns with using a forecast 24 \nrate.130 First, u sing a forecast rate creates inconsistencies with the time horizon of the DCF, 25 \nwhich is estimated as of the date of the dividend yield calculation. The mathematical formula 26 \nfor the present value of a periodic time series upon which the DCF is based discounts the 27 \nstream of future cash flows to a “time zero” one period before the first payment. The 28 \nresulting discount rate is as of that time zero. The first payment in the DCF model occurs one 29 \n 129 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 51 -70. \n 130 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 51 -56. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\ntime step from the dividend yield calculation date ; therefore the ra te determined by the DCF 1 \nmodel is as of that date . Using an interest rate expected at some future date in the CAPM 2 \nproduces a COE as of that future date, so  that COE is not directly comparable to the DCF’s 3 \nCOE.131 4 \n  Even if we ignored the inconsistency concern and want ed to use a forecast rate anyway, 5 \nmy second concern is that commonly available interest rate forecasts are no better predictors 6 \nof future interest rates than the current market rate , as explained in my Phase 1 direct 7 \ntestimony132 and demonstrated in Figure 15, an updated cross -plot of the 20- year Treasury 8 \nrate one year ahead against the current rate. Current interest rates account for approximately 9 \n95% of the variation in future interest rates. The current rate is also unbiased – exhibiting no 10 \ntendency to be systematically too high or too low.133 For the 20- year Treasury, bias accounts 11 \nfor less than 0.003% of forecast error. Similar predictive validity is obtained for 30 -year 12 \nTreasury and corporate bonds.134 In contrast, bias accounts for 48% of the BCFF’s 30- year 13 \nTreasury year -ahead forecast error.  14 \n 131 Morin has argued that “given that this proceeding is to provide ROE estimates for setting electric \nrates going forward, forecast interest rates are far more relevant. The use of interest rate forecasts is \nno different than the use of projections of other financial variables in DCF analyses” (Public Service Commission of South Carolina, Docket No. 2022-254 -E, Direct Testimony of Roger A. Morin for \nDuke Energy Carolinas, LLC, p. 40 , available at \nhttps://dms.psc.sc.gov/Attachments/Matter/ed924365 -3a5b-467d-a60c -686c22d5da63\n). As explained, \nthe use of a forecast interest rate in the CAPM is actually inconsistent  with the assumptions and \nresults of the DCF model.  \n 132 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 54 -55. \n 133 The bias in a forecast can be assessed from the decomposition of the mean square error into bias, inefficiency, and random variation components. See, e.g. , Jacob Mincer and Victor Zarnowitz, \nEconomic Forecasts and Expectations: Analysis of Forecasting Behavior and Performance, Nat’l Bureau of Econ. Rsch.(1969), p. 3-46, available at http://www.nber.org/chapters/c1214\n. \n 134 The 20-year Treasury is used here because much more historical data is available.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nFigure 14. Twenty -year Treasury rate, one year in the future vs. current135 1 \nJanuary 1925 -December 2023 2 \n 3 \n  Most critically, I have particularly strong objections to the most commonly used source 4 \nfor forecast interest rates, Blue Chip Financial Forecasts (BCFF).136 As explained in my 5 \nPhase 1 direct testimony, BCFF’s long- term Treasury forecast has a multi -decade track 6 \nrecord of upward bias.137 7 \n  Current rates’ high validity in predicting future rates can be explained more intuitively by 8 \nthe market’s forward -looking nature. If investors expect interest rates to rise, their 9 \nexpectations will be incorporated into current yields. Consider the alternative. Suppose an 10 \ninvestor expects the yield on the 30- year Treasury to rise from its current ~4% to 5% over the 11 \nnext six months. There is an inverse relationship between a bond’s value and its yield; when 12 \nthe yield rises, the value falls, and vice versa. An investor who expects bond yields to rise 13 \nwould not buy a bond today, because to do so would be to invest expecting a loss; better not 14 \nto buy the bond at all. But market participants do  buy at the current ~4%, implying that the 15 \nmarket overall does not  expect rates to rise in the future. Current yields are the best predictor 16 \nof future yields, especially for longer-term bonds. 17 \n 135 M.

How do utility cost of capital experts  justify the use of forecasts with such a poor track 6 \nrecord?  7 \nA. SDG&E  witness Coyne cited a Massachusetts regulatory decision to argue that “Blue Chip 8 \nFinancial Forecasts is widely relied on by investors and provides a useful proxy for investor 9 \nexpectations for the risk -free rate.”139 Similarly, Roger Morin  has argued, “the fact that 10 \ninvestors are willing to purchase such expensive services confirm [ sic] the importance of 11 \neconomic/financial forecasts in the minds of investors.”140 12 \n  These “investor reliance” and “willing ness to purchase” argument s implicitly assume that 13 \ninvestors rely only  on BC FF forecasts, to the exclusion of all other ways that investors might 14 \ndevelop their expectations; that they rely on BC FF’s forecasts as- is, with no adjustment for 15 \ntheir historical inaccuracy; and that investors’ only use of the forecasts is for investment 16 \ndecisions. None of these  assumptions is true.  17 \n  BCFF may be relied upon by some  investors, but no basis exists for Mr. Coyne’s claim 18 \nthat BCFF forecasts represent a reasonable proxy for investor expectations. BCFF has no 19 \nmore than a hundred thousand subscribers,141 less than 0.1% of the hundreds of millions of 20 \ninvestors who are exposed to Treasury rates through direct investments or as a benchmark for 21 \nother investments.142 Although utility cost of capital experts routinely argue that these 22 \n 138 Morin, New Regulatory Finance  at 172.  \n 139 Exhibit SDG &E-04 (Coyne), p. 38; Exhibit SC G-04 (Coyne) , p. 39 -40. \n 140 Public Service Commission of South Carolina, Docket No. 2022-254 -E, Direct Testimony of Roger \nA.

See \nhttps://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/legal/our -solutions . BCFF costs approximately $2,500/year. Even \nassuming BCFF accounts for 10% of segment revenue – roughly ten times the segment average – \nBCFF has no more than 40,000 subscribers.  \n 142 More than half of US adults and households are invested in the stock market.

The market 1 \nhas tens of millions of participants responding to all kinds of information and the small slice 2 \nof the market that uses BCFF does not represent an adequate or reasonably proxy. 3 \n  The consistent errors in BCFF forecasts are well -known; the Congressional Budget 4 \nOffice has issued public reports on BCFF’s interest rate forecasting errors for nearly twenty 5 \nyears.143 Many investors undoubtedly take BCFF’s forecasts “with a grain of salt” and 6 \ninform their decisions with other forecasts and information. Finally, BCFF reports include 7 \ndozens of other forecasts, as well as commentary and analysis. Investors might “rely” on 8 \nBCFF’s  reports for that other content, not BCFF’s interest rate forecasts, per se.  9 \n  Roger Morin has additionally argued in defense of forecast interest rates that “investors 10 \nprice securities on the basis of long -term expectations, including interest rates,” “investors’ 11 \nrequired returns can and do shift over time with changes in capital market conditions, hence 12 \nthe importance of considering interest rate forecasts ,” and “the empirical evidence 13 \ndemonstrates that stock prices do indeed reflect prospective financial input data.” 144 It is 14 \ncertainly true that investors price securities based on their expectations, and those 15 \nexpectations, and therefore investors’ required returns, change over time. But the truth of 16 \nthese statements by no means requires or even implies that investors rely on third -party 17 \nforecasts in general, or the BC FF forecast specifically, in doing so.  18 \n 19 \nQ. What is your recommendation with respect to the risk -free rate assumption in the 20 \nCAPM?  21 \nA. The high predictive validity of current interest rates, BCFF’s consistently poor track record, 22 \nand economic intuition are consistent with an extensive body of research on the superiority of 23 \nsimple prediction models to both more complex models and expert judgment.145 Current 24 \ninterest rates are the most accurate and unbiased publicly available estimates for future 25 \n 143 See, e.g.,  Congressional Budget Office, CBO’s Economic Forecasting Record  (November 2002), p. \n13, 18.  \n 144 Public Service Commission of South Carolina, Docket No. 2022-254 -E, Direct Testimony of Roger \nA.

Conveniently, using the current rate also entirely skirts the 1 \npotential concern about horizon inconsistency with the DCF. 2 \n  I recommend that the use of interest rate forecasts – in the CAPM, cost of debt (explained 3 \nin Section VIII below ), or anywhere else in utility regulatory proceedings – should be 4 \nprohibited unless it can be demonstrated that the proposed forecast has superior predictive 5 \nvalidity to the current rate.  6 \n 7 \nB. The Commission Should Require Parties to Evaluate Multiple Sources and 8 \nMethodologies in Estimating  Beta , as Opposed to Utilizing a Single Source or 9 \nEstimation Methodology . 10 \nQ. What is your second recommendation, regarding the sources of beta?  11 \nA. I recommend the Commission require assessment of multiple sources of beta, each  calculated 12 \nusing different estimation methodologies , and not allow CAPM COE estimates to rely on a 13 \nsingle source or estimation methodology. 14 \n 15 \nQ. Why can’t we rely on a single source for beta?  16 \nA. As I explained i n my Phase 1 direct testimony, beta is intended to be a forward -looking 17 \nmeasure of relative risk, so it is inherently uncertain.146 It cannot be measured directly (like 18 \nan interest rate) and is usually estimated from historical  data, as the slope of the regression of 19 \nthe returns of a stock against the returns of the market over a recently -ended historical period. 20 \nEstimates based on historical data generally reasonably reflect future expectations, because 21 \nmost companies’ risk profiles change slowly over time. Slowly changing risk profiles prove 22 \nparticularly true for the relatively stable and predictable utility sector.  23 \n  In my Phase 1 direct testimony, I provided numerous examples of how seemingly slight 24 \ndifferences in methodology can yield dramatically different results.  Figure 16 summarizes 25 \nthe beta s for the entire utility sector calculated under different methodologies for trailing 26 \nreturn history – 1, 2, or 5 years – and return calculation frequency – daily, weekly, or 27 \nmonthly presented in my Phase 1 direct testimony . Beta estimates range from 0.38 to 0.77, a 28 \nfactor of 2.  Even a parameter as arbitrary as the day of the week used to calculate weekly 29 \n 146 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 57 -69. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nreturns could cause beta to vary up to 57%.  This wide variance highlights the need to 1 \nevaluate betas calculated using a number of different methodologies.  2 \nFigure 15. Utility sector average beta under different calculation methodologies147 3 \nAs of May 2022  4 \nTrailing return history  \nYears  Return calculation frequency  \nDaily  Weekly  Monthly  \n1 0.39 0.43 0.77 \n2 0.48 0.54 0.38 \n5 0.71 0.74 0.48 \nMonday   0.69  \nTuesday   0.49  \nWednesday   0.56  \nThursday   0.67  \nFriday   0.77  \n 5 \n 6 Q. Wh at are some reasons beta estimates can vary so much under different calculation 7 \nmethodologies?  8 \nA. One key reason beta estimates can vary under different calculation methodologies is a 9 \ndramatic , but temporary, change in the risk of the market or in individual stocks, as in the 10 \npandemic- related market turmoil of early 2020 . That temporary change will influence the 11 \nbeta estimate for as long as the period of change is included in the trailing data used in the 12 \nbeta calculation, even if investors’ risk perceptions have returned to their level prior to the 13 \ndramatic change. Analysts should always examine whether the change in market conditions 14 \nwas temporary or sustained. 15 \n 16 Q. How can we determine whether the change in investors’ risk perceptions was 17 \ntemporary or has been sustained?  18 \nA. Determining whether the change in investors’ risk perception was temporary or has been 19 \nsustained is typically done by examining how betas calculated using different amounts of 20 \ntrailing data and returns calculated at different frequencies – for example, daily, weekly, or 21 \nmonthly – have changed over time.  22 \n  The 2022 off-cycle cost of capital proceeding provides a case in point. A primary Utility 23 \nargument was that their betas had jumped, indicative of increased investor risk perception.

Whether calculated using weekly, 7 \nmonthly, or daily returns, realized betas are approximately one -third lower.

Is the need to estimate beta using different methodologies well known?  13 \nA. Yes. Villadsen et al. discuss the trade -offs of different methodologies, highlighting the need 14 \nto consider shorter calculation intervals in the wake of abrupt disruptions such as was 15 \nexperienced first during and then immediately after the pandemic -driven bout of market 16 \nturmoil in early 2020:  17 \n 148 Exhibit PCF- 01 (Ellis), p. 57 -59. \n 149 M.

For example, Bloomberg allows users to easily override its default 12 \nbeta calculation parameters. S&P GMI, in addition to reporting betas calculated using 1 and 3 13 \nyears of trailing data, provides its users spreadsheet models that allow them to modify all of 14 \nits beta calculation parameters.  15 \n 16 \nQ. How should beta be selected?  17 \nA. Any decent analyst knows to “triangulate” any subjective input assumption, like beta, by 18 \nlooking at a variety of sources, comparing them to long- term historical trends, and reviewing 19 \nother relevant data, like company performance. At a minimum, the Commission should 20 \nrequire cost of capital experts to evaluate at least two betas, each calculated using different 21 \nmethodologies, such as Yahoo! Finance/Zacks (both of which use 5 years of monthly 22 \nreturns), S&P, Bloomberg, or the analyst’s own calculations. 23 \n 24 \nC. The Commission Should Prohibit Use of A djusted B eta, Which I s Not V alid 25 \nfor U tilities.  26 \nQ. What is your third  recommendation, regarding adjusted beta?  27 \nA. I recommend the Commission prohibit the use of adjusted beta, which is not valid for 28 \nutilities.  29 \n 30 \n 150 Villadsen  et al., Risk and Return for Regulated Industries  at 73 -76 (emphasis added).  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nQ. Please explain adjusted beta.  1 \nA. As explained in my Phase 1 direct testimony, “a djusted beta” refers to a mathematical 2 \nrevision to the “raw” regression -based  beta, based on an analysis conducted by Wharton 3 \nprofessor Marshall Blume in the early 1970s.151 Analyzing beta-sorted portfolios, he found a 4 \ntendency for betas, on average, to regress toward the market average beta, 1.0, from one time 5 \nperiod to the next.152 Based on this finding, some providers of beta estimates report adjusted 6 \nbetas that are a weighted average of the raw estimate and the market beta (1.0 by definition). 7 \nThe most common weighting is 2/3 on the raw beta, 1/3 on the market beta:153 8 \n   𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑢𝑢𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎=2\n3𝛽𝛽𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎𝑟𝑟+13 9 \n  For stocks with raw betas below 1.0, like most utilities historically, the effect of the 10 \nadjustment is to increase the beta one-third of the way toward 1.0. For example, a stock with 11 \na raw beta of 0.4 would have an adjusted beta of 2/3 x 0.4 + 1/3 = 0.6. For its adjusted beta, 12 \nBloomberg uses the common 2/3 and 1/3 weights. Value Line’s weights are similar, 0.67 and 13 \n0.35, respectively. Value Line also rounds to the nearest 0.05.154 14 \n 15 \nQ. Is beta always adjusted?  16 \nA. No. As PG&E and SCE witnesses Vilbert and Villadsen have noted, “a nalysts have different 17 \nviews on whether to use raw or adjusted betas,”155 and many frequently used sources of beta 18 \nreport only  unadjusted betas, e.g., Yahoo! Finance, and Zacks, and S&P GMI. Bloomberg 19 \nreports both raw and adjusted betas. 20 \n 21 \nQ. Is the Blume adjustment valid for utilities?  22 \nA. No, it is not. As explained in my Phase 1 direct testimony, t he Blume adjustment is based on 23 \nan observation of the tendency of betas, on average , to regress toward 1.0.156 But not every 24 \nstock exhibits this tendency. Blume did not investigate whether and how this tendency might 25 \nvary across stocks with different characteristics.  26 \n 151 Exhibit PCF- 02 (Ellis), p. 66-68.  \n 152 Blume, On the Assessment of Risk, The Journal of Finance, 26:1 (March 1971), p. 1-10.  \n 153 The 2/3 and 1/3 weights are based on the regression coefficients Blume presented in his original \npaper, which regressed betas in one period against betas in the previous period.  \n 154 Value Line, Value Line’s Estimation of Beta, based on  personal correspondence (October 6, 2021).  \n 155 Villadsen  et al., Risk and Return for Regulated Industries  at 80. \n 156 Exhibit PCF -01 (Ellis), p. 6 7-68. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  Rutgers professor Richard Michelfelder investigated the validity of the beta adjustment 1 \nspecifically for utility stocks and found no evidence of the average tendency observed by 2 \nBlume.157 This can be clearly seen in Figure 18, an update d analysis of the same 7 -year 3 \nmonthly beta used by Blume in his original research , for the entire utility sector going back 4 \nto 1933. Since the 1950s, the beta for the utility sector as a whole has tended to regress 5 \ntoward 0.50-0.60, not 1.0.158 Blume used mean squared error (MSQ) to assess the accuracy 6 \nof his adjustment. It can be shown that the standard 2/3 and 1/3 weights increase the MSQ for 7 \nutility betas by approximately 45%. 8 \n 157 Michelfelder, Theodossiou, Public Utility Beta Adjustment and Biased Costs of Capital in Public \nUtility Rate Proceedings , The Electricity Journal, 29:9 (November 2013), p. 60-68.  \n 158 One might ask whether the utility sector average reflects the tendency of individual utility stocks. Betas are additive, so a tendency for individual utility stocks to regress toward 1.0, on average, would \nbe reflected in the industry beta. Blume used the same logic to extrapolate from the portfolios he \nanalyzed to individual stocks.

In contrast, low -beta firms tend to run out of low- risk investment opportunities 6 \nand must accept more risk to stay in business. Neither of these causal explanations applies to 7 \nutility operating companies, like SDG&E  and the publicly traded members of its proxy 8 \ngroup. They are large and mature, and their investments tend to have consistently low risk 9 \nprofiles over time. These attributes combine to keep utilities’ betas sustainably and 10 \nsignificantly below 1.0. 11 \n 12 \nQ.

Does the  prohibition on adjusted beta preclude consideration of Value Line or other 1 \nsources of adjusted beta?  2 \nA.

What is your recommendation with respect to the use of adjusted beta in the CAPM for 7 \nestimating utilities’ cost of equity?  8 \nA. Empirical analysis specifically investigating utility betas, grounded in sound economic 9 \nreasoning, demonstrates that utility betas do not exhibit a tendency to regress toward the 10 \nmarket average and therefore should not be Blume-adjusted. The Commission should 11 \nprohibit the use of adjusted betas in implementations of the CAPM for estimating utilities’ 12 \ncost of equity. 13 \n 14 \nD.

The next three errors you identified are related to the market risk premium for the 18 \nCAPM. Please explain how the MRP is calculated.  19 \nA. The market risk premium is generally calculated  by separately estimating the market return 20 \nand the long- term risk -free rate and taking the difference. Two different estimates are 21 \ncommonly used: the long- term historical average and a forward -looking estimate based on 22 \ncurrent market prices.  23 \n 24 Q. What is your fourth recommendation, regarding the calculation of a forward- looking 25 \nMRP?  26 \nA. I recommend the Commission prohibit estimating the expected market return with the CG 27 \nDCF assuming analysts’ growth forecasts into perpetuity  or with a forecast risk -free rate.  28 \n 29 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nQ. Please explain the rationale for your fourth  recommendation. 1 \nA. To estimate the forward -looking market return  for the MRP, utility cost of capital experts 2 \noften use one or more analysts’ 3 -to-5-year EPS growth forecasts  in the CG DCF .163 As 3 \nexplained in Section  VI above , extrapolating these relatively short -term analyst EPS growth 4 \nforecasts into perpetuity, as the CG DCF does, leads to economically absurd results . 5 \n  The invalidity of these analyst forecasts beyond their explicit, relatively short- term 6 \nforecast horizon is well -known in the finance community. None of the independent 7 \ninvestment firms whose published CMAs I periodically survey estimates their market return 8 \nforecast using analyst estimates extrapolated into perpetuity. This explains why their market 9 \nreturn forecasts, at most 8. 3%, are systematically  far lower than witness Coyne’s CG DCF 10 \nestimate of 16%.164 11 \n  MRPs based on the CG DCF using analyst EPS growth forecasts should be prohibited. 12 \n 13 \nQ. Given your critique of interest rate forecasts, the forward -looking MRP should be 14 \ncalculated using a current, not forecast, long -term risk -free rate. Correct?  15 \nA. Correct.  16 \n 17 \nE. The Commission Should Require  Parties to  Use the Total, Not I ncome -Only, 18 \nBond R eturn i n Calculating a Historical MRP . 19 \nQ. Please explain the historical MRP, to which the fifth and sixth errors you identified are 20 \nrelated.  21 \nA. In principle, the MRP should be forward-looking, because the authorized rate of return 22 \nshould reflect the market cost of capital, i.e., the expected  return. When a forward-looking 23 \nfinancial variable, like the MRP, is difficult to estimate with precision, it is common to 24 \nestimate it from its long -term historical value, sometimes adjusting for relatively easily 25 \nquantified factors like inflation. The historical MRP is calculated as the difference in long - 26 \nterm historical average realized total  returns on the  market and long- term Treasurys.  27 \n 163 Analysts take a variety of approaches to implementing the CG DCF to estimate the expected market \nreturn. One approach is to use a forecast for the market as a whole, such as that  available from S&P. \nAnother approach is to us e forecasts for the individual companies in a broad market index and take a \nweighted average of either their growth rates or their expected returns. \n 164 Exhibit SDG&E -04 (Coyne), p. 40.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nQ. What is your fifth recommendation, regarding the calculation of a historical MRP?  1 \nA. I recommend the Commission require estimating the historical risk -free rate using total, not 2 \nincome-only, bond returns. A common error in estimating the historical MRP is to use the 3 \nincome- only return , but doing so is conceptually flawed. 4 \n 5 \nQ Why must the total bond return be used, and not the income -only return? 6 \nA. The rationale for using the income-only return is that  it reflects investor expectations. This 7 \nargument is conceptually flawed ; it is inconsistent with the entire premise of estimating 8 \ninvestor expectations from historical realized  returns. In addition, it does not reflect any 9 \nactual return investors can achieve except in the rare cases where the investor buys a long - 10 \nterm Treasury at issuance and holds it for two to three decades until maturity. For these 11 \nreasons, the total bond return, not the income -only return, should be used in calculating the 12 \nhistorical MRP.  13 \n 14 Q What is the difference between the total and income -only bond returns ? 15 \nA. The total return on any financial asset has two components, periodic cash flows like interest 16 \non bonds or dividends from stocks, and changes in the value of the asset over time, i.e., 17 \ncapital gains or losses.  18 \n 19 Q Wh y do some cost of capital experts use the income- only bond return?  20 \nA. In calculating the average historical return on long -term Treasurys, some utility cost of 21 \ncapital experts use only the income comp onent, essentially the average of the historical 22 \ninterest rates.\n165 Their rationale is that the interest rate reflects investors’ expected retu rn at 23 \nthe time they purchase the bond. 24 \n 25 Q. What is wrong with using the income -only return?  26 \nA. This argument is flawed for three  reasons. First, the historical MRP is the difference in long - 27 \nterm historical realized , not expected, returns. Recall, we are using the historical MRP 28 \n 165 See, e.g ., Exhibit SCE-02 (Villadsen ), p. 36: “One commonly used method for estimating the MRP is \nto measure the historical average premium of market returns over the income returns on government \nbonds over a long historical period.”  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nprecisely because it is difficult to estimate investors ’ expected  market return; the long -term 1 \nhistorical market return is deemed the next best alternative.  The income component of the 2 \ntotal bond return may reflect investors’ historical return expectations for bonds, but no 3 \ncorresponding data are available for investors’ hi storical return expectations for the 4 \nmarket.166 Expected  Treasury returns are not comparable to realized  market returns.  5 \n  Second, changes in Treasury rates reflect broader changes in the cost of capital for all 6 \nfinancial assets, including stocks. If we remove the capital -gain component arising from 7 \nchanges in interest rates from total Treasury return, we’d have to remove the capital -gain 8 \ncomponent arising from changes in interest  rates from the total market return as well.  This is 9 \nnot done, though, and the total market return, which reflects the capital -gain effects of 10 \ninterest rate changes, is not comparable to the income -only Treasury return , which does not. 11 \n  Third , to achieve a return equal to the income-only component of a long- term Treasury 12 \nreturn would require buying it at issuance and holding it to maturity. Most investors do not 13 \nhold Treasurys to maturity, so this is not a realistic assumption in estimating investors’ actual 14 \nrealized returns. It also is not comparable to how the realized market return is calculated , as 15 \nthe average one -year return, not the average of the annualized 20- or 30- year return s that 16 \nwould be comparable to the hold- to-maturity,  income-only return on long- term Treasurys . 17 \nThe Treasury return comparable to the yearly returns used to estimate the average market 18 \nreturn is comprised of one year of interest plus any capital gain or loss over the year.  There is 19 \nno costless way for an investor to lock- in just the interest component of the total bond 20 \nreturn.167 21 \n 22 \nQ. Is the difference between the total  return and income -only return significant?  23 \nA. The capital gain  or loss component of the return arises from changes in interest rates. When 24 \ninterest rates fall, the value of outstanding bonds rises, and vice versa. The longer the life of 25 \nthe bond, e.g., 30 vs. 5 years, the more sensitive it is to changes in interest rates.  26 \n 166 Researchers have concluded, though, that realized returns , on average , do not reflect investors’ \nhistorical expectations. A robust academic research literature has concluded that actual returns on \nequities substantially exceeded investor expectations during most of the twentieth century, a widely recognized phenomenon known as the equity premium puzzle. See, e.g. , Wikipedia, Equity Premium \nPuzzle, access at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_premium_puzzle\n [last accessed July 8, 2023].  \n 167 Locking-in the one -year return would be equivalent to buying  a one -year Treasury bill, with its \ncorresponding, typically lower, interest rate.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  As seen in Figure 20, i nterest rates have fluctuated quite a bit over time, so we might 1 \nthink the capital gains and losses cancel each out, and the average total return would be 2 \nroughly equal to the average income-only return. 3 \nFigure 19. Monthly average 20- year Treasury yield168 4 \nJanuary 19 25-December  2023 5 \n 6 \n This is not the case, though. Figure 21 summarizes the average total and income -only returns 7 \non the 20-year Treasury since 1925. Depending on the averaging methodology, arithmetic or 8 \ngeometric, which I will discuss below,  the total return varies by up to 0.31% from the 9 \nincome-only return. 10 \nFigure 20.

The Commission Should Require Parties to Use Geometric, Not Arithmetic, 1 \nReturns,  in Calculating a Historical MRP.  2 \nQ. What is your sixth recommendation, also regarding the calculation of a historical 3 \nMRP?  4 \nA. I recommend the Commission require the use of geometric, not arithmetic, returns in 5 \ncalculating both the historical market and risk -free bond returns used to estimate the 6 \nhistorical MRP.  7 \n 8 \nQ. What is the difference between arithmetic and geometric returns?  9 \nA. When analyzing investment returns, two different types of average are commonly reported: 10 \narithmetic  and geometric. The arithmetic average return is the  simple, unweighted average of 11 \na series of returns across mu ltiple historical holding periods (e.g., the average of monthly or 12 \nannual returns over multiple years) . It is calculated as: 13 \n𝑟𝑟1+𝑟𝑟2+⋯+𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑢\n𝑛𝑛 14 \n The geometric average is the fixed annual rate of return that, if compounded every year, 15 \nwould produc e the same value as compounding the series of returns in question. It is 16 \ncalculated as: 17 \n�(1 +𝑟𝑟1)(1 +𝑟𝑟2)⋯(1 +𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑢)𝑛𝑛−1 18 \n  A simple example illustrates the difference. Suppose a stock price increases by 50% in 19 \none year, then declines by 50% the following year, such that the ending value is 75% of the 20 \nstarting value. The arithmetic average is 0%, (+50% – 50%)/2, while the geometric average 21 \nis -13.3%, [(1 + 50%) x (1 – 50%)]1/2 – 1. 22 \n  Returns can be reported on either basis, depending on the context, but investors are not 23 \nindifferent between them. Investors care most about changes in asset values over time, and 24 \nonly the geometric return provides an unambiguous indicator of this change. Given a starting 25 \ninvestment value, for any geometric return there is a single future value, but for any 26 \narithmetic return there are an infinite number of potential future values. If the geometric 27 \naverage return is 5%, for example, in two years the value will be 1.05 x 1.05 – 1 = 1.1025. In 28 \ncontrast, if the arithmetic return is 5%, in two years the value could be anywhere from 0, (1 + 29 \n110%) x (1 – 100%), to 1.1025 if the return is the same 5% in each year. The arithmetic 30 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nreturn, on its own, does not indicate the future value and, unless it does not vary from year to 1 \nyear, systematically overstates it.  2 \n  It should also be noted that the DCF model yields a geometric average return,  i.e., the 3 \nfixed annual rate of return on the initial price that, if compounded every year, would have the 4 \nsame value over time as the sum of the DCF model’s past and future streams of dividends, 5 \ncompounded (past) and discounted (future) at the same rate. For comparability, the CAPM 6 \nshould also produce a geometric average return. 7 \n  For th ese reason s, geometric returns are generally considered a better measure of investor 8 \nlong- term expectations. 9 \n 10 \nQ. Why is the difference important in the context of the historical MRP?  11 \nA. The difference between arithmetic and geometric is important in the context of the MRP 12 \nbecause the two averaging methods produce materially different results.  Figure 22 shows the 13 \ncalculation of the historical MRP under each metho dology. The geometric MRP is 1.07% 14 \nlower than the arithmetic.  15 \nFigure 21. Arithmetic and geometric historical MRP169 16 \nJuly 1926- December 202 3, percent  17 \nTotal return  Arithmetic  Geometric  Arithmetic – geometric  \nMarket  11.35  10.08  1.27 \nLong -term Treasury  5.07 4.87 0.20 \nMRP  6.28 5.21 1.07 \n 18  19 Q. If geometric returns better reflect long -term investor expectations, why do some cost of 20 \ncapital experts use the arithmetic mean?  21 \nA. The choice between arithmetic and geometric returns for estimating investor expectations has 22 \nbeen hotly debated among academics and practitioners for decades. Some of the 23 \ndisagreement arises from differences in potential application. For example, in portfolio 24 \nmanagement, where Monte Carlo simulation is common, arithmetic averages, in combination 25 \nwith return distributions, are appropriate. In corporate finance and valuation, which is more 26 \n 169 M. Ellis analysis of FRED data, available at  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ ; NBER data, available at \nhttps://www.nber.org/research/data?page=1&perPage=50 . \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nanalogous to our objective, the choice depends on the life of the investment under 1 \nconsideration. The widely used finance text Valuation summarizes the current status:  2 \nThe choice of averaging methodology will affect the results. For instance, 3 \nbetween 1900 and 2014, U.S. stocks outperformed long- term government 4 \nbonds by 6.4 percent per year when averaged arithmetically. Using a 5 \ngeometric average, the number drops to 4.2 percent. This difference is not 6 \nrandom; arithmetic averages always exceed geometric averages when returns 7 \nare volatile.  8 \n 9 \nSo which averaging method on historical data best estimates the expected rate 10 \nof return? Well -accepted statistical principles dictate that the best unbiased 11 \nestimator of the mean (expectation) for any random variable is the arithmetic 12 \naverage. Therefore, to determine a security’s expected return for one period, 13 \nthe best unbiased predictor is the arithmetic average of many one-period 14 \nreturns. A one-period risk premium, however, can’t value a company with 15 \nmany years of cash flow. Instead, long-dated cash flows must be discounted 16 \nusing a compounded rate of return. But when compounded, the arithmetic 17 \naverage will generate a discount factor that is biased upward (too high). 18 \n 19 \nThere are two reasons why compounding the historical arithmetic average 20 \nleads to a biased discount factor. First, the arithmetic average may be 21 \nmeasured with error. Although this estimation error will not affect a one - 22 \nperiod forecast (the error has an expectation of zero), squaring the estimate (as 23 \nyou do in compounding) in effect squares the measurement error, causing the 24 \nerror to be positive. This positive error leads to a multiyear expected return 25 \nthat is too high. Second, a number of researchers have ar gued that stock 26 \nmarket returns are negatively autocorrelated over time. If positive returns are 27 \ntypically followed by negative returns (and vice versa), then squaring the 28 \naverage will lead to a discount factor that overestimates the actual two -period 29 \nreturn, again causing an upward bias.170 30 \n  Valuation goes on to recommend a widely used weighted average of the geometric and 31 \narithmetic averages, weighted more heavily toward arithmetic for short -lived investments, 32 \nconverging toward the geometric average if the investment life equals or exceeds the 33 \nduration of the historical time series from which the averages are calculated.  34 \n  NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran, known for his simple, practical advice to 35 \npractitioners, reaches a similar conclusion:  36 \n 170 Tim Koller et al., Valuation , McKinsey & Co. at 852 -853 (6th ed. 2015) (emphasis added).  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nAs we move to longer time horizons, and as returns become more serially 1 \ncorrelated (and empirical evidence suggests that they are), it is far better to use 2 \nthe geometric risk premium. In particular, when we use the risk premium to 3 \nestimate the cost of equity to discount a cash flow in ten years, the single 4 \nperiod in the CAPM is really ten years, and the appropriate returns are defined 5 \nin geometric terms. In summary, … the geometric mean is more appropriate if 6 \nyou are using the Treasury bond rate as your risk- free rate, have a long -time 7 \nhorizon, and want to estimate the expected return over that long time 8 \nhorizon.171 9 \n  Despite these recommendations from well -known and highly regarded sources, some 10 \nutility cost of capital experts nonetheless calculate the MRP using arithmetic average 11 \nreturns.172 Some have objected that stock returns are not negative ly autocorrelated over time , 12 \nas argued in Valuation,173 but this assertion is disproven by the data. M ulti-year stock returns 13 \nare strongly negatively autocorrelated from one period to the next. Figure 23 shows the 14 \nautocorrelation of annual stock market returns from 1927 through 2023, as a function of the 15 \nreturn calculation period, replicating and updating an academic study of long- term 16 \nautocorrelation in stock market returns.174 For return calculation periods of 14 to 20 years, 17 \nthe negative autocorrelation of returns is statistically significant at the p=0.05 level.175 Over 18 \nthe long term, periods of high returns do, in fact, follow periods of low returns, and vice 19 \n 171 Aswath Damodaran,  Discussion Issues and Derivations, \nhttp://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/AppldCF/derivn/ch4deriv.html  [last visited \nJuly 18, 2023].  \n 172 See, e.g ., Exhibit SCE-02 (Villadsen ), p. 40 (“ The MRP is the long -term historical arithmetic average \nof annual realized premiums of U.S. stock market returns over long -term (approximately 20-year \nmaturity) Treasury bond income returns … ”). \n173See, e.g., Application of Duke Energy Progress, LLC for Adjustment of Rates, Docket No. E -2, Sub \n1300, H earing T ranscript (Vol. 8 ), p. 301 (Duke Energy - Morin) (May 4, 2023).  \n 174 M.

Please provide an overview of the ECAPM. 1 \nA. The ECAPM is a modification of the traditional CAPM. It is based on an empirical 2 \nobservation in various historical academic studies that low -beta stocks tended to perform 3 \nbetter than predicted by the CAPM, and high-beta stocks worse, resulting in a “flattened” 4 \nsecurity market line (SML), the relationship between beta and return. To adjust for this 5 \nflattened relationship, some cost of capital experts , including PG&E witness Vilbert and SCE 6 \nwitness Villadsen,  adjust the CAPM as follows:177 7 \n𝑘𝑘=𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓+α+𝛽𝛽�𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓−α�  8 \n Roger Morin uses a different modification: 178 9 \n𝑘𝑘=𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓+ 0.75𝛽𝛽�𝑟𝑟 𝑚𝑚−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓�+ 0.25�𝑟𝑟 𝑚𝑚−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓� 10 \n Mathematically,  the effect of both versions of the Empirical CAPM is similar to the Blume 11 \nbeta adjustm ent, equivalent to adjust ing beta toward 1.0. 12 \n 13 \nQ. Is the ECAPM widely used?  14 \nA. The ECAPM is used only in utility cost of capital proceedings, particularly by experts 15 \ntestifying on behalf of utilities. No papers validating or endorsing the ECAPM have been 16 \npublished in any peer-reviewed journals, and it is not included in commonly used finance 17 \ntextbooks for students and corporate finance professionals. The papers commonly cited in 18 \nsupport of the ECAPM discuss only the empirical observation of the security market line’s 19 \n(SML) flatness; they do not propose or validate the ECAPM itself. Th e ECAPM  is 20 \nmentioned only in utility-focused practitioner guides, most notably Morin’s and witness es 21 \nVilladsen and Vilbert’s own books.179 22 \n 23 Q. Is the ECAPM valid for estimating the cost of equity for a utility?  24 \nA. The ECAPM is not valid for estimating the cost of equity for a utility, because the 25 \nassumptions and data used in the academic studies on which it is based are not analogous to 26 \n 177 See, e.g. , Exhibit SCE-02 ( Villadsen ), p. 38-39.  \n 178 Morin, New Regulatory Finance  at 189-1 92. \n 179 Morin, New Regulatory Finance  at 189-1 92; Villadsen , Risk and Return for Regulated Industries  at \n82-85.  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nhow the CAPM is implemented in utility cost of capital proceedings. There are two important 1 \ndifferences.  2 \n  First, the academic studies Morin and Villadsen et al. cite in support of the ECAPM all 3 \nuse a short -term risk -free rate; utility COC CAPMs typically use a long -term risk -free rate. 4 \nUsing a long- term rate implicitly flattens the SML – the risk -free rate is higher, while the 5 \nmarket return is unchanged. Because the ECAPM is based on the observation of a flattened 6 \nslope relative to a short- term rate, it over- compensates.180 7 \n  Second, the academic studies cited in support of the ECAPM do not examine utilities 8 \nspecifically. As observed with beta, utilities’ regulatory model can affect the behavior of 9 \ntheir equity returns relative to the market. In addition, the academic studies Morin and 10 \nVilladsen  et al . cite in support of the ECAPM are all at least 2 0 years out of date. The most 11 \nrecent study was published in 2004, based on data through 2003.181 12 \n  When analyses in the papers cited in support of the ECAPM are re-run using a long- term 13 \nrisk-free rate and more recent data, the “flatness” in the SML largely disappears for the 14 \nmarket as a whole, and completely disappears for utilities. Figure 24 shows the well -known 15 \nFama -French (FF) analysis that is frequently cited in support of the ECAPM.182 The FF 16 \nanalysis regresses the monthly annualized absolute returns of beta- sorted portfolios against 17 \nrealized beta.183 Overlaying it is a replication using the 30 -year Treasury instead of the 18 \noriginal study’s 1 -month T -bill and adding the utility index. The data span nearly  39 years 19 \nfrom January 1985 through November 2023. While the beta-sorted portfolios lie slightly 20 \nabove the SML, their regression slope and intercept coefficients are not statistically 21 \n 180 In substituting a long-term Treasury for a short -term risk -free rate, as is typically done in utility cost \nof capital analyses, analysts are implicitly adopting the zero -beta CAPM developed by Fisher Black, \nco-creator of the Nobel Prize winning Black -Scholes option pricing equation. This more general \nversion of the CAPM does not require the exis tence of a risk -free rate (over the long term, the short -\nterm rate is not risk -free, as investors are exposed to inflation and reinvestment risk; the long -term \nrate is subject to inflation if held to maturity and capital gains or losses due to interest rate changes if \nnot), just an investable asset or portfolio with a beta equal to zero. Long-term government bonds meet this criterion. \n \n181 Morin, New Regulatory Finance  at 222; Exhibit SCE-02 (Villadsen ), Appendix B, p. 10.  \n 182 Eugene F. Fama & Kenneth R.

The ECAPM is not used outside utility cost of capital proceedings and cannot be found in 2 \nwidely used finance texts. It is based on a misapplication of the academic research, which 3 \nuses a short -term risk -free rate and does not examine utilities specifically. The findings of the 4 \noriginal academic research cannot simply be “cut -and- pasted” into the utility cost of capital 5 \ncontext. 6 \n  When the analyses cited in support of the ECAPM are revised to reflect the context of 7 \nutility cost of capital proceedings in which it is commonly applied – utility equity returns in 8 \nexcess of the return on the long- term Treasury – the purported “flatness” in the security 9 \nmarket line disappears for both the market as a whole and specifically for utilities. Despite its 10 \nname, the empirical data do not support the ECAPM’s modifications to the traditional CAPM 11 \nfor use in estimating the cost of equity in utility regulatory proceedings. The Commission 12 \nshould prohibit the use of the ECAPM in determining the cost of equity. 13 \n 14 \n 15 VIII.

The Utilities Have Persistently Over -Collected Their Cost of Debt.  19 \nQ. Are the Utilities ’ embedded cost of debt estimates accurate?  20 \nA. No. As described in my Phase 1 testimony and seen in Figure 26, SDG&E  and SoCalGas 21 \nsystematically have over- collected  the cost of debt  from customers for over a decade.\n189 22 \n 188 Michael C.

SDG&E  witness Mekitarian dismissed your concern about cost of debt over- collection 6 \nas a “quibble.”191 How material is cost of debt over -collection to customer costs?  7 \nA. SDG&E  and SoCalGas’s cost of debt forecasts have also overstated their actual costs of debt. 8 \nIn 2021 excess, SDG&E ’s excess embedded interest resulted in at least $35 million of 9 \nunnecessary customer charges.192 10 \n 11 \nQ. How does cost of debt over- collection flow through to executive compensation?  12 \nA. SDG&E  executives personally benefit from cost of debt over- collection. For example, in 13 \n2021, the incremental earnings required for SDG&E ’s Short- Term Incentive Plan to double  14 \nthe payout on the financial performance component was only $16 million, as seen in Figure 15 \n 190 SDG&E  response to EDF data request EDF -DR-001 Question 3 (e -f); SoCalGas response EDF DR -\n01, Question 3.  \n 191 Exhibit SD G&E -07 ( Mekitarian ), p. 1. \n 192 M.

Upwardly biased interest rate forecasts are a contributing factor in 1 \ncost of debt over- collection . 2 \nQ. Do you know why SDG&E  and SoCalGas  have been over -collecting their cost of debt?  3 \nA. Cost of debt over- collection is at least partly attributable to the upwardly biased interest rate 4 \nforecasts they use to estimate the cost of future issuances of new debt. The source used by 5 \nSDG&E  and SoCalGas, Global Insights, has a track record, like BCFF, of systematic upward 6 \nbias. Global Insight’s 30-year Treasury forecast exceeded the actual yield by 0.76%, on 7 \naverage, from 2014 through 2021.197 8 \n 9 \nQ. Do you agree with witness Mekitarian ’s testimony that the use of forecast interest rates 10 \nis “consistent with long standing Commission practice” and that “Global Insights has 11 \nlong been recognized as an appropriate source for SDG&E proceedings.”   12 \nA. No. Witness Mekitarian cites the Commission out of context:198 13 \nGlobal Insights has long been recognized as an appropriate source for 14 \nSDG&E proceedings. In the 2019 Decision, the Commission found that 15 \n“Global Insight escalation rates are specific to the utility industry and more 16 \naccurately reflects SDG&E’s . . . inflationary  cost increases.”  In SDG&E’s 17 \n2019 GRC, the Commission similarly concluded that “Global Insight’s 18 \nforecasts have been utilized or served as the basis for utility forecasts in prior 19 \nand other GRCs. The resulting customer forecast also tracks well and h as 20 \nminimal differences with historical data since 2012.”  21 \n The Commission refer s specifically to inflation, not interest rate, forecasts.  22 \n  I have presented empirical evidence that both BCFF and Global Insight interest rate 23 \nforecasts have been systematically biased for many years, and that the current interest rate is 24 \na far better predictor. It is possible that the Utilities and the Commission were not aware of 25 \nthe bias in their preferred forecasts and the superiority of the current rate. But now that these 26 \nfacts are known, what is the rationale for continuing to rely on forecasts known to 27 \nsystematically transfer wealth from utility customers  to utility shareholders – and, it turns 28 \nout, utility executives, as well? 29 \n 197 M.

As you noted in Section III.C.1 above , newly issued debt accounts for only 19% of the 1 \ntotal in SDG&E ’s embedded cost of debt calculation.  Does the upward bias in the 2 \nforecast account for all of the cost of debt over -collection?  3 \nA. It does not appear so, and witness Mekitarian ma de a similar observation.199 But t he elephant 4 \nin the room is the  persistent, systematic cost of debt  over- collection. If it’s not due to inflated 5 \ninterest rate forecasts, what is the cause? Witness Mekitarian never explains.  6 \n 7 \nB. The Commission Should Investigat e and Seek to Minimize Utilities’ 8 \nEmbedded Cost of Debt Over -Collection.  9 \nQ. What are your recommendation s with regard to the embedded cost of debt?  with 10 \nrespect to the use of forecast interest rates in utility regulatory proceedings?  11 \nA. I have two recommendations. The first is straightforward. As with the CAPM , and for the 12 \nsame reasons described in Section  VII.A above , the Utilities should be prohibited from using 13 \na forecast interest rate in their embedded cost of debt calculation  and required to use the 14 \ncurrent rate . 15 \n  In light of Utilities’ persistent cost of debt over- collection, its material impact on 16 \ncustomer cost, and its unearned enrichment of utility executives, my second recommendation 17 \nis that the Utilities be required to provide a thorough investigation of the causes of cost of 18 \ndebt over- collection and steps they will take to minimize it in the future.  19 \n 20 \n 199 Exhibit SDG&E -07 ( Mekitarian ), p. 13- 14. \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nIX. CLOSING REMARKS 1 \nQ. Do you have any additional ideas about how the Commission’s decision -making process 2 \ncould be improved?  3 \nA. Yes. Based on my observations and review of cost of capital proceedings before this 4 \nCommission and across the nation, I believe the  Commission could benefit from considering 5 \nthe following  recommendations described by FERC A LJ Scott Hempling:200 6 \n(1) “frame the case as a public interest inquiry,”2017 \n(2) “demand high quality testimony,”2028 \n(3) “organize the evidentiary hearing around issues,”203 and 9 \n(4) avoid regulatory capture.20410 \nQ. W\nould you describe the Commission’s role in setting a  rate of return as “more art than 11 \nscience”? 12 \nA. No. I disagree strongly with the claim that utility rate of return is “more art than science.” 13 \n200 Scott Hempling, Effective Regulatory Procedures: Purposes, Practices and Paths (2016), available at \nhttps://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Presentation%20by%20Scott%20Hempling%2C%20Attorney\n%20at%20Law%2C%20Maryland%20%2C%20USA%2C%20commentator%20on%20the%20Effect\nive%20Regulation%20of%20Public%20Utilities.pdf .  \n 201 Id. at p. 11-12.  \n 202 Id. at p. 12-13  (“Effective testimony is educational testimony. … Pre -filed testimony should not \nmerely state the party’s position.

It offers perspectives, not positions.”)  \n 203 Id. at p. 13-14 (“Effective hearings organize around issues rather than parties. The hearing days are \ndivided into issue segments. For each issue segment, all parties’ witnesses who address that issue appear on a panel simultaneously.”) \n \n204 Id. at 15 -16 (“ ’Capture’ is an extreme form of persuasion. To achieve persuasion is to obtain what the \npersuader wants. To be persuaded is to give what the persuader wants. To be captured, then, is to be in a constant state of ‘being persuaded’ – based on the persuader’s identity rather than an argument’s \nmerits. Regulatory capture is not persuasion in its illicit forms – financial bribery, threats to deny \nreappointment, promises of future employment. These things all have occurred, but they are  forms of  \ncorruption, not capture. Nor is regulatory capture a state of being controlled, where regulators are \nrobots executing commands issued by interest groups. Regulatory capture is neither corruption nor \ncontrol. Regulatory capture is evidenced by a surplus of  passivity and reactivity, along with deficit of \ncuriosity and creativity. It is a body of commission decisions, or non-decisions, about resources, procedures, priorities and policies, where what the utility wants has more influence than what the public in terest requires. Regulatory capture is defined by the regulator’s attitude, not by the utility’s \nactions. The active verb ‘capture’ signals an affirmative effort, to take someone captive. But the noun \n‘capture, ’ and the passive verb ‘to be captured ’ – they signal a state of being. One can enter that state \nthrough one’s own actions or inactions. One can allow oneself to be captured. One can assist, and \nsustain, one’s own captivity.”)  \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\n  Utility cost of capital experts often make th e claim that setting a rate of return is “more 1 \nart than science” in an attempt to justify their biased and often illogical opinions. As my 2 \ntestimony demonstrates, there are well -established best practices, supported by finance 3 \ntheory and empirical evidence, on how to estimate the cost of capital. Every one of my 4 \nrecommendations is backed by rigorous research. I make no hand-wavy, unsupported 5 \nassertions, I have nothing to hide, and I welcome scrutiny of my analysis and conclusions. 6 \n  While different analysts may make slightly different assumptions, there is not much 7 \nwiggle room in estimating the cost of equity if done rigorously and thoughtfully. The 8 \nremarkable consensus across dozens of professional investment firms on the expected market 9 \nreturn demonstrates that there is a general “right way” to estimate the cost of equity. That 10 \nauthorized utility ROEs consistently deviate so far from this consensus, and so systematically 11 \nin one direction, is proof that whatever is done in utility rate of return proceeding s is a 12 \n“wrong way.” 13 \n 14 \nQ. Do you have any closing remarks based on your unique perspective as a former utility 15 \nexecutive responsible for the internal cost of capital function ? 16 \nA. Yes. In addition to creating, implementing, and overseeing Sempra’s enterprise -wide cost of 17 \ncapital function, I was responsible for hundreds of diverse and sophisticated economic and 18 \nfinancial analyses over the course of my 15 years with the company. I have a comprehensive 19 \nand detailed insider’s understanding of how utility managers think about the cost of capital 20 \nand credit considerations in the context of investment decisions and shareholder value 21 \ncreation.  22 \n  I have testified on the cost of capital in regulatory proceedings for several of the largest 23 \nutility companies in the US. There is a great deal of consistency in utilities’ cost of capital 24 \nanalysis and testimony, likely attributable to the fact that just four firms provide over 90% of 25 \ntestimony on behalf of utilities nationwide, as seen in Figure 28. 26 \nSchedule ME-3 \nEllis Direct \nCURE Exhibit _____\nFigure 27.

My business address is Suite 600, 445 Minnesota Street, Saint 3 \nPaul, Minnesota 55101. 4 \nQ. By whom are you employed? 5 \nA. I am a Financial Analyst with the Office of the Minnesota Attorney General – Residential 6 \nUtilities Division (OAG).   7 \nQ. What are the Attorney General’s responsibilities regarding utility consumers?  8 \nA. Among other things, “ the attorney general is responsible for  representing and furthering 9 \nthe interests of residential and small business utility consumers through participation in 10 \nmatters before the Public Utilities Commission involving utility rates and adequacy of 11 \nutility services to residential or small business utility consumers .”1 12 \nQ. What is your educational and professional background?  13 \nA. I hold an MBA from the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota as 14 \nwell as a bachelor of science degree in f inance, also from the Carlson School.  I have eight 15 \nyears of experience in finance with 3M Company and Lockheed Martin.  My 16 \nresponsibilities at these firms  included financial modeling, cost accounting, audit, 17 \ndiscounted cash flow analysis, and project management including cost and schedule 18 \nanalysis.  I also provided strategic financial counsel to senior leadership in the areas for 19 \nwhich I was responsible.   20 \nI started with the OAG in 2015, and I have provided testimony on behalf of the 21 \nOAG before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (Commission) in seven electric 22 \n1 Minn. Stat. § 8.33, subd. 2. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n2           D ock et No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  rate cases and eight natural gas rate cases.  I also testified in the Commission’s inquiry into 1 \nnatural gas utilities’ actions during Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, where I described 2 \nutilities’ failure to hedge customer exposure to the financial impact of spikes in the market 3 \nprice of natural gas.  More recently, I provided testimony as part of an inquiry into service - 4 \nquality violations by a wireline telecommunications carrier.  5 \nII. TESTIMONY OVERVIEW  6 \nQ. What is the purpose of your testimony? 7 \nA. The purpose of my testimony is to provide the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission 8 \n(“Commission”) information to help it decide whether to approve the proposed acquisition 9 \nof ALLETE, Inc. by a small number of private investors. 10 \nQ. What do  you discuss in your testimony? 11 \nA. First, I provide an overview of the proposed acquisition , including describing the investors 12 \nwho are proposing to acquire ALLETE.  Then I provide a high- level introduction to the 13 \n“private equity”  business.  Next,  I explain  that the Partners’ past actions provide indications 14 \nof both potential benefits and risks to Minnesota P ower if the proposed acquisition were 15 \napproved.  Finally, I explain several potential steps that Minnesota Power  and ALLETE  16 \ncould take toward reaching the State of Minnesota’s clean energy goals if the Commission 17 \ndoes not approve the proposed acquisition in its current form.  At this time, I do not provide 18 \nan overall recommendation on whether the Commission should approve or not approve the 19 \nproposed acquisition, but I do request that ALLETE and the Partners propose additional 20 \nconditions that would (1) enhance the probability that the potential benefits materialize  and 21 \n(2)help mitigate the risks . 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n3           D o cket No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  Q. At a high level, h ow could the acquisition impact Minnesotans if it is approved?  1 \nA. The proposed transaction has the potential to i mpact a wide variety of areas, including jobs, 2 \ninfrastructure investment, electricity prices, electricity bills , and the broader community.  3 \nAdditionally, Minnesotans would no longer be able to purchase ALLETE shares on the 4 \nNew York Stock Exchange and therefore would not be able to do things like directly vote 5 \nfor the members of the board of directors.   6 \nIII. THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION 7 \nQ. Please describe ALLETE, Inc.  8 \nA. ALLETE is a diversified publicly traded  firm headquartered in Duluth, Minnesota .  9 \nALLETE has several wholly owned subsidiaries operating a variety of businesses. 10 \nMinnesota Power is an electric utility that is currently an operating division of ALLETE, 11 \nrather than one of its wholly owned subsidiaries.   12 \nMinnesota Power has  an exclusive service territory in which everyone wishing to 13 \nconnect to the electric grid must do so through Minnesota Power.  Additionally, Minnesota 14 \nPower operates under the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in 15 \nproviding retail electric service .    In addition to Minnesota Power, ALLETE also holds 16 \nseveral other investments such as : a coal mine, Florida real estate, solar/wind 17 \ndevelopers/operators, and eight percent of another company called American Transmission 18 \nCompany, LLC.  ATC is under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ’s jurisdiction . 19 \nQ. Can you briefly summarize the proposed acquisition?  20 \nA. A group of investors is proposing to acquire ALLETE, Inc. and take it private.  This means, 21 \namong many other things, that investors would no longer be able to buy shares of ALLETE 22 \n(ticker symbol: ALE) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  Existing ALLETE 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      4           D ocket No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n shareholders would receive $67 per share in cash, and, to the extent they are not a part of 1 \nthe group buying ALLETE, would no longer have shareholder rights.   2 \nOverall, the proposed acquisition totals approximately $6.2 billion, which is 3 \ncomprised of approximately $3.9 billion of equity and “$2.3 billion of assumed ALLETE 4 \ndebt.”2  Part of the purchase price will be funded through new debt secured by the 5 \nacquirers’ shares of ALLETE.  If the acquisition is approved as proposed, a newly formed 6 \nlimited liability company (LLC)  named Alloy Parent LLC would become the new direct 7 \nowner of ALLETE, Inc. with a number of entities , including both LLCs and limited 8 \npartnerships, existing in the corporate hierarchy above Alloy Parent  LLC .  The top of the 9 \nhierarchy controlling ALLETE would be BlackRock, Inc. (ticker symbol: BLK).  10 \nBlackRock has 15,000 employees in 38 countries and manages over $10 trillion in assets.   11 \nQ. How is the $3.9 billion in equity calculated?  12 \nA. The approximate $3.9 billion in equity is calculated by multiplying the number of 13 \noutstanding shares by the $67 per share that the buyers are willing to pay. There are 14 \napproximately 57.8 million ALLETE shares outstanding.3  So, 57.8 million shares at $67 15 \neach equals approximately $3.9 billion. 16 \nQ. Who are the investors that are trying to take ALLETE private? 17 \nA. Entities controlled or managed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and  18 \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners (GIP) , including Tower Bridge Infrastructure Partners, L.P., 19 \nare trying to take ALLETE private.

Who would control ALLETE if the transaction is approved?  3 \nA. Global Infrastructure Partners would maintain strategic control of both GIP Fund V’s 40  4 \npercent interest and Tower Bridge’s 20 percent interest, ultimately reaching a 60  percent 5 \ncontrolling share for GIP, now a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock.   Ultimate 6 \nstrategic control rests with BlackRock for all of the subsidiaries in which it has a controlling 7 \ninterest within its corporate hierarchy .  BlackRock itself is not necessarily involved with 8 \nthe “day -to-day” activities of its subsidiaries.20 9 \nIV. INTRODUCTION TO PRIVATE EQUITY. 10 \nQ. You’ve described GIP as a “private equity” firm.  What is “private equity?” 11 \nA. Private equity has been described as follows:  12 \nThe term private equity investment  in the most general sense means 13 \ninvestments in equity (stock) of companies that are not traded on stock 14 \nexchanges and, therefore, are not available for investment by the general 15 \npublic.  Private equity firms  are financial intermediaries that help investors 16 \n(usually large institutional investors and often referred to as limited partners 17 \nor “LP’s”) make private equity investments by contributing capital to 18 \n“funds” established by the private equity firms.  Successful private equity 19 \ninvesting relies on careful evaluation of investments , structuring the 20 \ninvestments or deals , financial engineering and operational engineering.21 21 \n \n19 Press Release, BlackRock, BlackRock Completes Acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners \n(Oct. 1, 2024) , attached as Schedule BPL -D-2. \n20 Day-to-day activities could include working within established budgets for things like routine \nentry -level  recruiting, onboarding, and scheduling; coordinating with vendors to purchase office \nsupplies; or community engagement. \n21 PAUL ALAN GOMPERS & STEVEN N. KAPLAN , ADVANCED INTRODUCTION TO PRIVATE EQUITY  \n11 (eBook ed. 2022) (emphases in original). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      10           D ocket No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n Q. Would you explain the structure of private equity firms and private equity funds?  1 \nA. Yes.  Private equity firms are often started and run by people with finance, consulting, or 2 \nbusiness operations backgrounds.  Many private -equity- firm founders and employees hold 3 \nan MBA or are former CEOs.  Private equity funds often comprise l imited partners and a 4 \ngeneral partner .  Limited partners (LPs) commit to provide most of the capital for the fund’s 5 \neventual investments.  The general partner (GP) is owned, controlled, or managed by one 6 \nor more employees of a private equity firm.  The GP selects the fund’s investments and 7 \nmay provide a limited amount of capital to the fund.  For example, a  GP may provide 8 \n2 percent of a fund’s capital while the LPs may provide the remaining 98 percent .  The GP 9 \nworks to gain investment commitments from potential LPs.  The LPs do not generally 10 \nprovide all of the cash to the GP immediately; the GP receives “commitments from LPs 11 \nrather than actual cash.”22  The LPs provide cash to the GP only when the GP needs it for 12 \nan investment or to pay fees; Gompers and Kaplan refer to this as “‘just in time’ funding 13 \nof investments and fees.”23  14 \nQ. Please l ist some private- equity -fund general partner s. 15 \nA. Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle, and KKR & Co. all own, control, or manage one or more PE  16 \nGPs.  17 \nQ. Who are typical private- equity -fund limited partners?  18 \nA. LPs are often institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds  and pension funds, or high- 19 \nnet-worth individual people.   20 \n \n22 Id. at 15. \n23 Id. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      11           D ocket No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n Q. Would you explain the fee structures of private equity firms in general?  1 \nA. Yes.  A classic fee structure used by private equity, hedge funds, and venture capital firms 2 \nis the “ 2 and 20 ” model, immortalized in the title of a book by Sachin Khajuria —Two and 3 \nTwenty: How the Masters of Private Equity Always Win.  The “2” references a fee equal 4 \nto 2 percent of an investor’s assets and the “20” references 20 percent of profits.  That 5 \nmeans that for each $100 an investor invests, the firm will retain its $2 asset fee plus $2 of 6 \na $10 annual profit, so the investment firm would earn fees of $4 and, after fees , the investor 7 \nwould end the year with $106.  There could be other variations on the 2 and 20 model such 8 \nas splitting profits 50/50 instead of 80/20. 9 \nQ. What is “public equity” as distinct from private equity?  10 \nA. The main  distinction is  whether or not a company’s shares are traded on a public exchange 11 \nlike the New York Stock Exchange.  Companies with shares that are publicly traded are 12 \nalso known as public companies.24  Investors in public companies are also  referred to as 13 \n“public equity investors ,” and the markets in which public companies trade are called 14 \npublic equity markets.   15 \nQ. How do private equity investors differ from public equity investors?  16 \nA.  As I noted earlier, private equity investors are often institutional investors like , sovereign 17 \nwealth funds  and pension funds, or high- net-worth individual people.  Public investors can 18 \nbe almost anyone, including individuals, investment firms , or pension funds. 19 \n \n24 SmartAsset , Differences of Private vs. Public Equity , Nasdaq  (Sept. 27, 2024, 5:26 PM), \nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/differences -private-vs-public-equity, attached   as  Schedule \nBPL-D-3. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      12           D ocket No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n Q. Would you provide examples of investment firms and pension funds that could invest 1 \nin public companies?  2 \nA. Yes.  BlackRock is an example of an investment firm and CalPERS and the Canada Pension 3 \nPlan are examples of pension funds.  Those organizations can all invest in public 4 \ncompanies.  5 \n Q. Do most companies start out as private companies? 6 \nA. Yes, most companies start out private and remain private.  There are millions of private 7 \ncompanies in the United States25 and currently fewer than  5,000 public companies.26   8 \nQ. Do all private companies have traits like  the traits of private  equity firms described 9 \nearlier?  10 \nA. No, most private firms are not private equity firms that raise investment commitments from 11 \nLPs and then buy other companies.  The millions of private firms include companies with 12 \nonly one employee like carpenters, or electricians.   13 \nQ. Are there any private equity firms that are publicly traded?  14 \nA. Yes. A few publicly traded firms are large players in the private  equity space, including 15 \nApollo (ticker: APO), Blackstone (ticker: BX), Carlyle (ticker: CG), and KKR & Co. 16 \n(ticker: KKR).   17 \n \n25 The most recent data available from the U .S. Census Bureau shows that there are over six million \nfirms in the US.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n Q. Why would a private company want to become a public company? 1 \nA. There could be many reasons that a private company might want to go public.  The U.S. 2 \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lists several reasons, the first of which is “to 3 \nraise capital and potentially broaden opportunities for future access to capital.”27 4 \nQ. When was ALLETE first listed on the NYSE?  5 \nA. ALLETE’s predecessor, Minnesota Power and Light, was first listed on the NYSE in 1950, 6 \nallowing it to access capital to build power plants in “the 1950s through the 1970s to help 7 \naccommodate an increasing industrial load.”28 8 \nQ. Why would a company that has already gone public want to revert to being a private 9 \ncompany? 10 \nA. There could be many  reasons that a public company may want to go private, including the 11 \nability to  shift strategies  more easily  or avoiding things that public companies face like 12 \nactivist shareholders.  Reducing dividend payments  would also be easier  as a private 13 \ncompany. 14 \nQ. How do private equity investment strategies differ from those of public investors?  15 \nA. Most investors pursue financial profit goals.  However, many of the strategies that  private 16 \nequity firms use to achieve those profit goals significantly differ from the strategies of other 17 \ntypes of investors, including investors in public companies.   18 \n \n27 Should My Company “Go Public ?” U.S. Securities & Exch.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n Investors in public companies generally do not seek to make significant changes to 1 \nthe businesses in which they invest,29 while private equity firms often seek to become the 2 \ncontrolling shareholder in order to make significant changes, including: 3 \n1. Changes to the board of directors,  4 \n2. Changes to strategy, 5 \n3. Changes to the lines of business in which the company operates,  6 \n4. Changes to the level of day- to-day operating expenses,  7 \n5. Changes to long- term capital expenses, or  8 \n6. Changes to the capital structure of the business. 9 \nChanges like those often serve to  change a business ’ cash flow.  10 \nQ. What is cash flow?  11 \nA. Cash flow is the net amount of cash going into or out of an organization during a given 12 \ntime frame like a fiscal year.   13 \nQ. H ow might a private equity firm change cash flow? 14 \nA. Increasing sales and cutting costs are classic examples that would generally improve cash 15 \nflow.  Taking on additional debt (adding leverage) and selling assets can bring cash into a 16 \nbusiness in a given year.  Additionally, paying suppliers more slowly or asking customers 17 \nto pay earlier  could improve cash flow.  18 \nQ. How else do investment strategies differ between public and private equity investors?  19 \nA. Public and private  equity investors have significantly different exit strategies. An “exit 20 \nstrategy” is a plan for eventually ending involvement with a particular investment; it may 21 \ninclude specific timing , methods, and  objectives, or it may be a more generalized plan.    22 \n \n29 However , some investors in public companies specifically pursue activist -investor strategies that \nbenefit from taking control of a target company. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      15           D ocket No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n The exit strategy for investors in public companies is often simply selling their 1 \nshares through the same public market where they originally purchased the shares at a time 2 \nwhen they feel the shares are fully valued.  3 \nPrivate equity exit strategies are often much more specific regarding timing; many 4 \nprivate equity funds have a pre -planned lifespan, after which the GP will sell the fund’s 5 \ninvestments with the goal of maximizing profit for the LPs.  Private equity exit strategies 6 \ncan include (1) strategic buyers, (2) financial buyers, or (3) an initial public offering (IPO) 7 \ninto public markets.  Analyzing the type of buyer for an eventual exit strategy is  an 8 \nimportant consideration for private equity firms.   9 \nQ. Can you please define the three types of private equity exits you mentioned above? 10 \nA. “Strategic buyer” refers to a buyer that would likely  integrate the new acquisition into its 11 \nexisting operations .  A “financial buyer” could be an entity  like another private equity fund 12 \nor a hedge fund.30  An IPO refers to allowing the public to trade the shares of a company 13 \nby listing them on a public stock exchange, like the NYSE.  A private equity firm could 14 \npursue an IPO for the entire firm as a whole or for one or more of the companies it owns, 15 \nindividually or as a n amalgamated  group.   16 \nQ. After an IPO, does a  public company continue to buy and sell its shares back and 17 \nforth with public  investors ? 18 \nA. G enerally,  no.  Public i nvestors primarily buy and sell shares among themselves.  If the 19 \nlisted company has excess cash or thinks its shares are underpriced, however, it may buy  20 \nback  some shares; conversely, if the listed company needs additional capital , it may sell 21 \n \n30 One type of financial buyer is a continuation fund which refers to a new fund established by a \nprivate equity firm that would buy an asset from one of the firm’s existing funds. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      16           D ocket No s.

The daily buying and selling in the market is generally among third - 1 \nparty investors, and  the listed company is not generally involved with these transactions.  2 \nQ. For a company being sold by a private equity fund, can you describe some potential 3 \nimpacts of those three types of exits?   4 \nA. The table below summarizes some pros and cons of various exit strategies.  I note , however, 5 \nthat this list is nonexhaustive, and the specific advantages and disadvantages of a strategy  6 \nwill depend on the facts of a particular situation . 7 \nExit \nstrategy  Pros Cons \nStrategic \nbuyer ● Can open an expanded customer \nbase \n● May provide additional resources \nand investment  ● Potential culture clashes  \n● Job overlaps may result in layoffs  \n● Leadership continuity unlikely \nFinancial \nbuyer ● Experienced buyer with a \nstreamlined process to close the deal \n● May provide additional resources and investment \n● Potential leadership continuity  ● Potential emphasis on aggressive \nperformance targets  \n● Excessive leverage can reduce financial flexibility  \n● Uncertainty regarding the future \nafter the life of a fund  \nIPO ● Access to vast pools of capital \nfrom public investors  \n● Gains visibility in the \nmarketplace  \n● Likely leadership continuity  ● Increased disclosures and \nscrutiny \n● The IPO process can be expensive \n \nQ. Are there any other differences between private equity investors and public 8 \nshareholders?  9 \nA. Private equity firms may strategically increase the amount of debt, or “ leverage, ” being 10 \nused within a business or within the corporate hierarchy above it in order to increase their 11 \npotential profit percentage.   The  private equity firm may do this  through its control of the 12 \nboard of directors. 13 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      17           D ocket No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n Q. How can increasing the amount of debt used to finance a business lead to higher 1 \nreturns on equity?  2 \nA. Using a lower amount of equity (and a corresponding higher amount of debt) amplifies or 3 \n“leverages ” the returns.  Leverage amplifies both positive and negative returns.  I will 4 \nprovide a simple example of leverage amplifying a positive return:  Think about buying a 5 \nhouse for $100,000 in cash (no debt) and immediately  selling it for $120,000.  That would 6 \nprovide a 20 percent  return.31  Compare that with a second scenario where the house is still 7 \npurchased for $100,000 and sold right away for $120,000 but the purchase is funded using 8 \na $50,000 loan and $50,000 of the buyer’s own  cash.  In that scenario, the return for the 9 \nbuyer would double from 20 percent  to 40 percent32 because the buyer is using less of their 10 \nown cash to achieve the same $20,000 profit. 11 \nQ. What are some of the other potential impacts of leverage on a company? 12 \nA. It has been said that “the large, fixed interest and principal repayment schedules on debt 13 \nenforce [s] discipline.”33  In other words, additional debt in an organization’s capital 14 \nstructure puts pressure on management to avoid incurring unnecessary expenses. 15 \n  Increased debt weakens certain credit metrics and can weaken a company’s credit 16 \nrating. 17 \n  Excessive debt levels can erode shareholder value  if the debt causes profit to decline 18 \ntoo much.  Relatedly , a company that avoids low -cost debt may erode shareholder value .  19 \n \n31 20% = $20,000 / $100,000 \n32 40% = $20,000 / $50,000 \n33 GOMPERS & KAPLAN , supra note 22, at 12. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      18           D ocket No s.  E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nLebens Direct  \n That is, both excessive and insufficient debt  can result in a suboptimal capital structure  1 \nwith an unnecessarily high cost of capital.34 2 \nFinally, in extreme cases when a company is unable to repay its debts, liquidation 3 \nor reorganization through the bankruptcy process can result. 4 \nQ. What might a private equity firm’s investment strategy look like for a n electric  5 \nutility?  6 \nA. M ost, if not all, of the private equity strategies, including those  I discuss above , could apply 7 \nto a privately owned utility.  P rivate equity  strategies for a utility could include things like 8 \nworking to increase sales, cutting labor or other expenses, adding leverage, and generally 9 \nexercising strategic control through the ability to select the board of directors.  A private 10 \nequity firm could also use the utility’s monopoly position to maximize the profitability  of 11 \nthe firm’s broader investment portfolio by influencing the business decisions of affiliated 12 \ncompanies.   Overlapping board memberships between the utility and  its parent entities 13 \ncould directly or indirectly support those efforts.35 14 \nV.

What d oes ALLETE say about synergies? 19 \nA. ALLETE witness Scissons briefly mentions that “achieving operational synergies was not 20 \na core catalyst for the transaction” but that Minnesotans “may benefit from the scale and 21 \nexpertise of the Partners.”36 22 \n \n34 An optimal blend of debt and equity can vary between companies and over time ; fine-tuning the \nblend helps a company work toward the lowest possible weighted average cost of capital.    \n35 Overlapping board memberships  can create conflicts of interest  because directors serving on \nmultiple boards may share strategic information . \n36 Scissions Direct  at 12.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      19           D ocket No s.

What might private equity ownership mean for ALLETE and Minnesota Power?  11 \nA. ALLETE has said that it  does  not expect immediate or direct efficiencies in how Minnesota 12 \nPower operates, but acknowledges that “the access to more readily available capital allows 13 \na greater focus on day -to-day operations, and Minnesota Power will continue to focus on 14 \ncontinuous improvement to provide safe and reliable energy. ”42  In addition, the evidence 15 \ndiscussed above suggest s that GIP [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET 16 \nDATA BEGINS]   17 \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS] .

What else have ALLETE and the Partners said about the transaction’s potential 3 \nsynergies?  4 \nA. ALLETE and the Partners say that they do not anticipate immediate or tangible reduced 5 \ncosts due to a “reduced workforce or other changes in operations due to redundancies” but 6 \nthat “[t]o the extent [Partners’] additional experience or economies of scale becomes of 7 \nvalue to Minnesota Power and therefore its customers, those benefits would flow to 8 \ncustomers in future cost recovery proceedings.”44  The discussion earlier about operational 9 \nvalue- add and “synergy” suggests that costs per customer could remain relatively stable or 10 \ndecline.   11 \nQ. What do you conclude about the impact of the Partners ’ expertise and involvement  12 \nin ALLETE if the acquisition is approved? 13 \nA. I generally  agree with ALLETE witness Scissions ’ point that Minnesotans may “benefit 14 \nfrom the scale and expertise of the Partners.”45  But, I conclude that there are both (1) 15 \npotential benefits and (2) risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed acquisition.  16 \nQ. What will you discuss next? 17 \nA. In the next section, I discuss actions that Minnesota Power could take toward reaching 18 \nMinnesota’s clean energy goals  if the proposed acquisition is not approved. 19 \n \n43 GOMPERS & KAPLAN , supra note 22, at 13. \n44 ALLETE & Partners  Response to Department IR 0047, attached as Schedule BPL -D-7. \n45 Scissions Direct  at 12. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      24           D ocket No s.

What does ALLETE say is one of the main reasons for the proposed acquisition?  4 \nA. It states  that Minnesota Power  needs to incur significant capital expenses to achieve 5 \ncompliance with Minnesota’s 100% by 2040 law .   Its difficulty of raising that capital from 6 \ninvestors is one of the main reasons ALLETE and the Partners  have proposed this 7 \nacquisition . 8 \nQ. What is ALLETE’s estimated capital need?  9 \nA. ALLETE says it needs  approximately $20 billion over 20 years.  The vast majority of that 10 \ncapital -spending need is driven by Minnesota Power.  11 \nQ. C ould ALLETE’s need for capital  be mitigated?  12 \nA. Yes.  There are a number of ways that ALLETE could mitigate its capital need s while still 13 \nhelping Minnesota achieve its clean energy goals.  I list some of them below: 14 \n1. Minnesota Power  could use power purchase agreements (PPAs) to buy the 15 \npower from third -party  facilities rather than owning the  facilities  itself.  16 \nCompared to constructing and owning facilities, purchasing power requires 17 \nrelatively little upfront capital.  18 \n2. Minnesota Power  could allow customers the freedom to more easily produce 19 \ntheir own electricity behind the meter.  20 \n3. ALLETE could sell non -core assets (e.g. Allete Clean Energy, New Energy 21 \nEquity, BNI Energy, and ALLETE’s e quity interest in ATC) to raise cash and 22 \nredeploy the capital to help fund the energy transition. 23 \na.

GIP itself explains that it is willing to pursue [ HIGHLY 3 \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]  4 \n5 6 \n7 \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA 8 \nENDS]\n47  9 \n4. ALLETE could raise equity in the public markets from investors including 10 \nBlackRock, CPP, and CalPERS, who also invest in publicly traded companies.   11 \nBlackRock is currently ALLETE’s largest shareholder, holding approximately 12 \n13 percent of the company ’s outstanding shares. 13 \n5. ALLETE could slow dividend growth and use the increased retained earnings 14 \nto help fund the energy transition.  Xcel Energy, Inc. is an example of one utility 15 \nthat has begun slowing its rate of dividend growth in order to reinvest.  Paying 16 \nout less in dividends would leave more cash available to fund any needed clean- 17 \nenergy investments. 18 \na.

MP could encourag e customers to participate in a load -flexibility program.  25 \nThat could help reduce the costs that customers eventually pay as MP  integrates  26 \nintermittent renewable generation onto its system.  Minnesota Power already 27 \nhas such “demand response” programs in place, but more could be done to 28 \nincrease the amount of flexible customer load on its system. 29 \n \n46 GIP Supplemental Response to D epartment  IR 0012, attach. 0012.02 SUPP HCTS at  16, \nattached as Schedule BPL -D-8. \n47 GIP Response to Department IR 0006, attach. 0006.01 HCTS at 23, attached as Schedule BPL -\nD-5. \n48 CPP Second Supplemental Response to Department IR 0060, attach. 60.01 Supp 2 HCTS  at 11, \nattached as Schedule BPL -D-9. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      26           D ocket No s.

I conclude that the proposed acquisition holds risks, uncertainties, and potential benefits  3 \nfor Minnesota Power and its ratepayers .  The Commission should carefully weigh the risks 4 \nand uncertainties against the potential benefits as it decides whether to approve the 5 \nproposed acquisition of ALLETE and the resulting  transfer of control from public investors 6 \nto a consortium of private equity investors, with a 60 percent stake controlled by the largest 7 \nasset manager in the world, BlackRock, Inc. 8 \nQ. Do you have any further requests?  9 \nA. I request that, in their rebuttal testimony, ALLETE and the Partners propose conditions 10 \nthat would mitigate the potential harms  and help ensure the potential benefits of the 11 \nproposed transaction materialize if it is approved.  Specifically, proposed conditions 12 \nshould, at minimum,  address : 13 \n1. Potential b enefits : 14 \na. The Partners’  expertise in things like continuous improvement and 15 \noperational efficiency  could help mitigate  Minnesota Power’s rate 16 \nincreases .  17 \nb. The Partners ’ expertise in  optimiz ing the capital structure , the cost of 18 \ncapital, and cash flow  could help mitigate Minnesota Power’s rate 19 \nincreases.  20 \n2. Potential harms : 21 \na. The risk that board of director control could be abused. 22 \nb. The risk that the Partners could decide to reallocate needed capital away 23 \nfrom Minnesota Power. 24 \nc. The risk that the Partners could over -allocate capital to Minnesota 25 \nPower’s rate base that is not needed for the energy transition. 26 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n      27           D ocket No s.

Finally, as capital has become more scarce in a higher interest rate environment, companies\nare exploring partnership opportunities for their embedded infrastructure assets to improve their returns on invested capital or\nto raise capital to reinvest in their core businesses.BlackRock has a broad network of global corporate relationships as a long-term investor in both their debt and equity. These\nrelationships will help us lead critical investments in infrastructure to improve outcomes for communities around the globe and\ngenerate long-term investment benets for clients.\nThe combination of GIP with BlackRock’s highly complementary infrastructure offerings creates a comprehensive global\ninfrastructure franchise with differentiated origination and asset management capabilities. The over $150 billion combined\nbusiness will seek to deliver clients market-leading, holistic infrastructure expertise across equity, debt and solutions at\nsubstantial scale. Marrying the proprietary origination and business improvement capabilities of GIP and BlackRock’s global\ncorporate and sovereign relationships provides a platform for diversied, large-scale sourcing to support deal ow and co-\ninvestment opportunities for clients. We believe bringing GIP and BlackRock together will deliver to clients the benets of\nbroader origination and business improvement capabilities.Founded in 2006, world leading independent infrastructure investor GIP manages over $100 billion in client assets across\ninfrastructure equity and debt, with a focus on energy, transport, water and waste, and digital sectors. GIP’s performance has\nbeen driven by proprietary origination, operational improvements, and timely exits. They have successfully scaled their global\nequity agship series, with the most recent fully invested agship fund in 2019 surpassing $22 billion.BlackRock’s over $50 billion of infrastructure client AUM is comprised of infrastructure equity, debt and solutions, and has grown\nboth organically and inorganically since inception in 2011. Top investment talent at BlackRock lead franchises that include\nDiversied Infrastructure, Infra Debt, Infra Solutions, Climate Infrastructure and Decarbonization Partners.\nThe GIP management team, led by Bayo Ogunlesi and four of its founding partners, will lead the combined infrastructure\nplatform. They will bring with them talented investment, and operationally focused business improvement teams with a strong\ntrack-record of building and running high-performing private markets businesses. GIP’s founders and teams remain highly\ncommitted to clients, and we expect the integration with BlackRock’s broader platform will generate even greater opportunities.\nSubject to completion of customary onboarding procedures, BlackRock has also agreed to appoint Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP Founding\nPartner, Chairman and Chief Executive Ofcer, to the Board at the next regularly scheduled board meeting following the closing\nof the transaction.“Infrastructure is one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities, as a number of structural shifts re-shape the\nglobal economy. We believe the expansion of both physical and digital infrastructure will continue to accelerate, as governments\nprioritize self-sufciency and security through increased domestic industrial capacity, energy independence, and onshoring or\nnear-shoring of critical sectors. Policymakers are only just beginning to implement once-in-a-generation nancial incentives for\nnew infrastructure technologies and projects,” said Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock Chairman and CEO.“I’m delighted for the opportunity to welcome Bayo and the GIP team to BlackRock, and happy to announce our plans to have\nBayo join our Board of Directors post-closing. We founded BlackRock 35 years ago based on a unique understanding of\ninvestment risk and the factors and forces driving investment returns. GIP’s deep understanding of the factors and forces driving\noperational efciency for long-term value creation have made them a global leader in infrastructure investing. Bringing these\ntwo rms together will create the infrastructure platform to deliver best-in-class investment opportunities for clients globally,\nand we couldn’t be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us.”“I’m excited about the power of this combination and the prospect of working with Larry and his talented team. We share with\nBlackRock a culture of collaboration, client focus, investment partnership, and commitment to excellence. Investors have\nadopted private infrastructure investing for its ability to provide stable cashows, less correlated returns, and a hedge against\nination. Global corporates have turned to private infrastructure as a fast innovator and a more commercially agile owner of\ninfrastructure assets that aren't core to their commercial businesses. This platform is set to be the preeminent, one-stop\ninfrastructure solutions provider for global corporates and the public sector, mobilizing long-term private capital through long-\nstanding rm relationships,” said Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP Founding Partner, Chairman, and CEO. “We are convinced that together we\ncan create the world’s premier infrastructure investment rm.”GIP Prole1/30/25, 3:53 PM BlackRock Agrees to Acquire Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”)\nhttps://www.blackrock.com/corporate/newsroom/press-releases/article/corporate-one/press-releases/blackRock-agrees-to-acquire-global-infrastructure… 2/6\nDocket Nos.

Its over 40 portfolio companies\ngenerate over $75 billion in annual revenue and employ approximately 115,000 people around the world. GIP’s success has been\ndriven by its targeted focus on real infrastructure assets in the transport, energy, digital, and water and waste sectors. GIP’s in-\ndepth knowledge of target industries underpins its ability to originate proprietary transactions through outright ownership and\ncorporate joint ventures, conduct deep and extensive diligence, and structure investments.In addition to proprietary origination, business improvement is a key pillar of GIP’s infrastructure approach, with a dedicated\nteam delivering deep operational enhancements.

Public equity offers easy access to market\ninformation and the flexibility to quickly buy or sell shares. Private equity\ninvestments, on the other hand, can involve more in-depth research and\ndue diligence, as they are typically less regulated and less transparent. Afinancial advisor  can work with you to analyze both types of investments\nfor your portfolio and help you manage the risks.\nHow Does Private Equity Work? \nPrivate equity  investment pools funds from high-net-worth individuals  and\ninstitutional investors  to acquire stakes in private companies. Unlike public\nmarkets, where shares are traded openly, private equity investments are\ntypically made in companies that are not listed on stock exchanges. 1/30/25, 3:56 PM Differences of Private vs. Public Equity | Nasdaq\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/differences-private-vs-public-equity 2/18\nDocket Nos.

These\nfirms often supply expertise and other resources to help companies they\ninvest in reach growth targets. This assistance can involve anything from\nproviding strategic guidance to implementing cost-cutting measures or\nexpanding into new  markets. The ultimate aim is to exit the investment  at a\nprofit, typically through a sale or an initial public offering (IPO) .\nInvesting in private equity can offer higher returns but it also comes with\nmore risk. Private equity investments are generally illiquid, meaning they\ncannot be easily sold or exchanged for cash. Additionally, success rests on\nthe ability of the private equity firm to effectively manage and grow  the\ncompanies in their portfolio. Investors considering private equity must\nconduct thorough due diligence and many work with a financial advisor to\nhelp navigate the complexities.\nHow Does Public Equity Work? \nPublic equity refers to shares of a company that are traded on public stock\nexchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Companies\nbecome public by offering shares to the general public through an initial\npublic offering (IPO). This process allows the company to tap a broad pool\nof investors for capital to use for expansion, research and development or\nother business needs.\n1/30/25, 3:56 PM Differences of Private vs. Public Equity | Nasdaq\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/differences-private-vs-public-equity 3/18\nDocket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 \nDirect Schedule \nBPL-D-3, p. 3 of 18\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nFor investors, public equity provides an opportunity to own a piece of a\ncompany and potentially benefit from its growth and profitability. The value\nof these shares fluctuates based on market conditions, company\nperformance and investor sentiment.\nPublic equity markets play an important role in the economy by facilitating\nthe flow of capital between investors and companies. These markets\nprovide liquidity, enabling investors to buy and sell shares with relative\nease. This liquidity is essential for maintaining investor confidence and\nensuring that companies can access the funds they need to grow. \nPublic equity markets provide transparency because publicly traded\ncompanies are required to disclose financial information regularly. This\nhelps investors make informed decisions and contributes to the stability\nand efficiency of the financial system.\nInvesting in public equity can be an effective way to build wealth over time ,\nbut has its own risks as well. Share prices can be volatile, especially in the\nshort term, as they are affected by influences including economic\nconditions, industry trends and geopolitical events. To mitigate  risk,\ninvestors often diversify portfolios  by investing in a mix of stocks across\ndifferent sectors and regions. 1/30/25, 3:56 PM Differences of Private vs. Public Equity | Nasdaq\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/differences-private-vs-public-equity 4/18\nDocket Nos.

Here's a breakdown of seven key differences to consider\nwhen investing in private or public equity.\nAccessibility: Public equity is traded on stock exchanges, making it\neasily accessible to individual investors. Private equity involves\ninvesting in companies not listed on public exchanges, often requiring\nsignificant capital as well as connections that can be hard to develop.Liquidity: Public equity offers high liquidity, as investors can buy and\nsell shares quickly. Private equity investments are typically long-term,\nwith funds locked in for several years.\nRegulation: Public companies are subject to strict regulatory\nrequirements and must disclose voluminous financial information.\nPrivate companies have fewer regulatory obligations, so investors often\nknow less about what they are getting into.Transparency: The transparency of public equity can help investors\nmake more informed decisions based on available data.\nPotential returns and risks: Private equity often targets higher returns,\nbut has higher risks due to less liquidity and transparency. Public\nequity returns are generally more stable but can be influenced by\nmarket volatility, especially in the short term.Investment horizon : Public equity investments can be short-term or\nlong-term, depending on market conditions and investor goals. Private\nequity typically requires a long-term commitment, with a focus on value\ncreation over several years.1/30/25, 3:56 PM Differences of Private vs. Public Equity | Nasdaq\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/differences-private-vs-public-equity 7/18\nDocket Nos.

As businesses thrived and the population grew in the mineral-rich and heavily forested area,\nseveral utility companies consolidated and then incorporated in 1906 as Duluth Edison Electric Co., the\nimmediate predecessor of Minnesota Power.\nIn the early 1920s, six major electric utilities and many municipal and privately owned local plants were\noperating in what is now Minnesota Power’s service territory. By 1923, after acquiring and consolidating\nmany regional utilities, the company became known as Minnesota Power and Light Co.\nThe stock of Minnesota Power and Light was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1950 under the\nticker symbol MPL. When the corporate name was changed to ALLETE, Inc. in 2000, the stock’s ticker symbol\nbecame ALE. Minnesota Power remains the largest division of ALLETE.\nIn the early days, the company relied on the region's rivers to generate hydropower to serve its customers. In\nfact, the incorporation papers of the Duluth Edison Electric Co., read in part \"to improve, develop and use\nwater power for heat, light and power purposes; and to develop, generate and use electric energy and\ncurrents for heat, light and power purposes, otherwise than by water power.\"\n 1/30/25, 3:59 PM History - Minnesota Power is an ALLETE Company\nhttps://www.mnpower.com/Company/History 1/2\nDocket Nos.

Power plants, including Laskin\nEnergy Center, Taconite Harbor Energy Center and Boswell Energy Center, were built during the 1950s\nthrough the 1970s to help accommodate an increasing industrial load.\nMinnesota Power continues to generate energy at Boswell Energy Center Units 3 and 4 while adding more\nsources of renewable energy. Today, Minnesota Power delivers 50% renewable energy to customers via its\nhydro, solar, biomass and wind resources. The 25-megawatt Taconite Ridge Wind Center began operating in\n2008, and the four-phase, 500-megawatt Bison Wind Energy Center in North Dakota was completed in 2015.\nLaskin Energy Center was converted from coal to a natural gas peaking plant in 2015.1/30/25, 3:59 PM History - Minnesota Power is an ALLETE Company\nhttps://www.mnpower.com/Company/History 2/2\nDocket Nos.

If the answer to\n(a) is yes, identify and quantify the efficiencies, and explain why ALLETE cannot achieve thoseefficiencies without the proposed transaction.\nResponse:  \nIt is Minnesota Power's typical practice to avoid stating formal legal objections and/or standing on those \nobjections to discovery in Minnesota regulatory proceedings, to the extent practicable, to facilitate a cooperative and productive process. However, many of the questions and stated premises, as well as the \nargumentative tone, in this set of information requests from CUB’s external witness (CUB IRs 1 -72) are \noutside typical discovery practices in the Minnesota regulatory process, and therefore necessar ily affect the \nCompany's and Partners' responses.  \nIn\n addition, consistent with Minnesota practice, the party(ies) and witness(es) responding to this discovery \nrequest are denoted by the witness information in the footer of this response.  \nThe Company is not expecting any changes in operations as an immediate or direct result of the Acquisition, as Minnesota Power will continue to operate within the current family of companies, \nand with the current management and staffing to support safe, re liable, and affordable electric \nservice.

Such synergies tend to come in the form of reduced workforce or other changes in operations d ue to redundancies, which are not anticipated as part of this \nAcquisition.  As stated in the Petition, ALLETE entered into this transaction with the primary goal of Minnesota Power gaining access to the significant capital it needs to continue and expand o n its investment \nin clean energy technology and systems, including changing transmission and generation needs, and to further its commitment to provide safe, reliable, and affordable energy to it s customers.  \n The Partners’ experience investing in large -scale infrastructure businesses has included investments in electric \nutilities, water and waste utilities, gas utilities, renewable energy infrastructure, gas pipelines, electric transmission infrastructure, LNG facilities and in a number of non- utility regulated entities such as airports and \nrail operators. The Partners’ significant experience with these types of investments, particularly with respect to electric utilities and renewable energy infrastructure, will support Minnesota Power and its clean energy transition efforts.

Stat. § 216B.1691 .  8 \n 9 \nQ. Would you p l ease provide an executive summary of  the Department’s conclusions?  10 \nA. Sure. The Department reviewed the proposed Acquisition using the Commission’s 11 \ntypical balancing test to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh potential 12 \ndetriments. The ultimate goal of this analysis is to determine if the proposed transaction 13 \nis “consistent with the public interest,” as required by Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 (2024). In 14 \nthis case, the Department concluded that (1) the Acquisition is not likely to provide 15 \nmeaningful public interest benefits, and (2) it could cause significant harm to the 16 \nCompany’s ratepayers by causing rates to be higher than they would be absent the 17 \ntransaction. As a result, the Department concludes that the potential benefits do not 18 \noutweigh the potential detriments, and therefore is not consistent with the public 19 \ninterest.  20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 3  A sserted Benefits  1 \n  The  Petitioners have asserted two public interest benefits associated with the 2 \nAcquisition: (1) improved access to the capital necessary to fund Minnesota Power’s 3 \nsignificant, planned investments in the coming years; and (2) access to the Partners’ 4 \nexpertise with respect to utility and energy infrastructure and renewables. Both of these 5 \nbenefits, however, appear highly speculative. First, the Petitioners have not provided 6 \nmeaningful evidence that the Company’s current access to capital is inadequate or that 7 \nthe Acquisition will improve its access to capital. In fact, as I discuss in greater detail 8 \nbelow, in certain distressed scenarios, the Company’s access to capital may be worse 9 \npost -Acquisition than it would be as a publicly traded company. Second, the Petitioners 10 \nhave not provided meaningful evidence that access to the Partners’ expertise will 11 \ntranslate to material benefits to the Company or its ratepayers, such as lower rates 12 \nresulting from operational cost cutting or improved procurement processes. Therefore, 13 \nAcquisition should not be expected to provide any benefits to the public interest.  14 \n Risk of Ratepayer Harm  15 \n  Ba sed on its review, the Department believes that the Acquisition could cause 16 \nsignificant harm to Minnesota ratepayers. First, the Acquisition raises a significant risk of 17 \nhigher debt financing costs for Minnesota Power, which would increase the Company’s 18 \nrates for electric service. The post -Acquisition corporate structure would allow parent 19 \nentities formed solely for purpose of owning Minnesota Power to potentially issue 20 \nsignificant amounts of debt. While the Partners have asserted any such debt would be 21 \nnon-recourse with respect to Minnesota Power, the credit ratings agencies and 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 4 potential debt investors would nonetheless likely view the debt unfavorably and require 1 \nhigher interest rates on Minnesota Power’s future debt issuances. Further, the 2 \nAcquisition may exacerbate Minnesota Power’s existing exposure to financial risks 3 \nresulting from the lack of separation between Minnesota Power and ALLETE’s non- 4 \nregulated businesses. The new owners could invest billions of dollars in ALLETE’s riskier, 5 \nnon-regulated enterprises, further magnifying the utility’s risk to potential financial 6 \ndistress or bankruptcy. The lack of adequate financial protection may also depress the 7 \nutility’s credit ratings and lead to higher cost of debt.  8 \n  Sec ond, the Acquisition raises significant risks of financial harm to Minnesota 9 \nPower’s ratepayers that may potentially result from self -dealing between the Company 10 \nand the other investment holdings and affiliates of GIP (which is now a part of 11 \nBlackRock, Inc., the world’s largest asset manager) and CPP Investments. More 12 \ngenerally, the Parties’ heavily caveated commitments to transparency fail to recognize 13 \nthe import of the Commission’s oversight responsibility.  14 \n  Thi rd, the proposed post -Acquisition governance structure is not well -defined 15 \nand fails to reflect that the principal business of ALLETE is the provision of regulated 16 \nutility service. As a publicly traded company, ALLETE’s focus is largely directed to the 17 \nactivities of its two regulated utilities. If the proposed merger is approved, ALLETE and 18 \nits utilities will be owned by private equity funds with extensive holdings, a much 19 \nbroader scope, and uncertain priorities.  20 \n  In  summary, the Department sees significant downside risk from the Acquisition 21 \nthat could harm ratepayers, workers, and host communities with few definite benefits.  22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 5 Q. P lease briefly describe the legal standard for approval of proposed transactions like 1 \nthe Acquisition.  2 \nA. I understand that Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 (2024) governs acquiring property through 3 \nmerger and acquisition, and requires that the Commission find such transactions to be 4 \n“consistent with the public interest” in order to authorize them. The Commission has 5 \npreviously found that this standard does not require an affirmative finding of benefits, 6 \njust a finding that the transaction is compatible with the public interest.1 7 \n  Th e Commission has historically used a balancing test to determine if an 8 \nacquisition is “consistent with the public interest,” weighing perceived detriments 9 \nagainst benefits. The Commission has recognized that evaluation of proposed 10 \ntransactions like the Acquisition must of necessity be somewhat speculative. No one 11 \nknows with absolute certainty every effect a significant transaction may have.  12 \n 13 \nQ. Please describe the Acquisition at issue in this proceeding.  14 \nA. In July 2024, ALLETE and the Partners filed a joint petition (“Petition”) w ith the 15 \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission seeking approval for the Partners to acquire the 16 \nCompany.  Under the merger agreement, CPP will own a 40% interest in ALLETE while 17 \nGIP will hold a controlling 60% stake in ALLETE through its Global Infrastructure Partners 18 \nV (“GIP Fund V”) and Tower Bridge  Infrastructure Partners, L.P.

W hat potential benefits of the proposed Acquisition have the Petitioners  identified?  1 \nA.

Please de scribe your review of the proposed Acquisition.  7 \nA. The Department engaged Silv erpoint Consulting, LLC (Silverpoint) to help review the 8 \nAcquisition.  Together, we assessed the potential benefits claimed by the Petitioners, 9 \nand the potential for the Acquisition to pose other risks or detriments to the Minnesota 10 \nPower’s ratepayers, and the public interest generally.  11 \n  I r eviewed the potential for the Acquisition to provide Minnesota Power with 12 \nimproved access to capital.

A SSERTED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION  1 \nQ. What topics do you address in this section of your testimony?  2 \nA. In this section, I describe and assess the two public interest benefits of the Acquisition 3 \nclaimed by the Petitioners: improved access to capital and access to the Partners ’ 4 \nexpertise. Prior to discussing access to capital, I provide a brief overview of utility 5 \nfinancing.  6 \n 7 \nA. OVERVIEW OF UTILITY FINANCING  8 \nQ. Please generally describe utilities’ need for access to capital.  9 \nA. As described in the direct testimony of Minnesota Power witness es J ohn D. 10 \nQuackenbush  and Joshua D. Taran , electric utilities are capital -intensive businesses.  The 11 \nprovision of safe and reliable utility service requires significant amounts of long -lived 12 \nphysical infrastructure. T ransmission lines, for example  are often expected to remain in 13 \nservice for 60 years or longer, and wind turbines are often assumed to have 25 -35 year 14 \noperating lives.  15 \n  Ut ilities recover the costs of these assets from ratepayers over the  assets’  16 \noperating, or useful, lives, rather than upfront. Because utilities cannot  fund new capital 17 \nprojects with funds provided by ratepayers, they must obtain the needed capital from a 18 \ndifferent source : debt and equity investors, via the capital markets.  Funds sourced from 19 \ncapital markets bridge the gap between when utilities need capital to pay for a new 20 \nproject, and when ratepayers pay for the project.  21 \n 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 11 Q. P lease explain the general concept of a “rate of return.”  1 \nA. Investors will not supply capital to a utility if they expect only to recoup their initial 2 \ninvestments, and nothing more. Even if investors knew with certainty they would 3 \nrecoup their initial investments over time, investing their available cash in a utility (or 4 \nany company ) would mean forgoing or delaying spending on consumption of other 5 \ngoods and services. Investors would require compensation for that forgone 6 \nconsumption. Of course,  no business is guaranteed to succeed, meaning utility investors 7 \nmay not recoup their initial investments.  Investors also demand compensation for that 8 \nrisk. Th e total  compensation  investors require in order to be willing to provide funds to 9 \nthe company is the required rate of return.  10 \n 11 \nQ. Are there important differences between r ate-regulated utilities  and non -regulated 12 \nfirms operating in competitive environments ? 13 \nA. Yes. I n a competitive environment, prices, incomes, and rates of return are determined 14 \nby the forces of supply and demand. For example, if one widget producer raises its 15 \nprices too much, its customers can easily switch to a different widget producer with 16 \nlower prices; competition keeps prices in check. Further, if there are not enough widget 17 \nproducers to meet aggregate demand for widgets, widget producers will have the 18 \npower to raise prices and earn returns that are disproportional to the risks involved in 19 \nwidget- making – that is to say, the industry as a whole will earn returns greater than the 20 \nrate of return investors require to invest. This high profit level will give entrepreneurs an 21 \nincentive to enter the widget business. When they do, the total supply of widgets in the 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 12 market will increase, causing prices to fall, and the industry’s overall rate of return will 1 \ndecrease to the rate investors require. At that point, entrepreneurs will have no more 2 \nincentive to enter the industry, and the industry’s rate of return will stabilize.   3 \n  Similarly,  if the supply of widgets exceeds demand, the industry as a whole will 4 \nnot earn high enough returns to adequately compensate investors for the risks they are 5 \ntaking on. Some widget producers will go out of business, reducing total supply to an 6 \noptimal level and widget prices will increase until the industry’s overall rate of return 7 \nreaches the rate investors require. At that point, no one will have incentives to enter the 8 \nindustry, and again, the industry’s rate of return rate will stabilize at the rate investors 9 \nrequire.   10 \n  In s hort, in a competitive market, the forces of supply and demand interact in 11 \nsuch a way that resources are allocated to produce an optimal mix of goods and 12 \nservices , and in doing so, push the rates of return actually earned by firms to investor’s 13 \nrequired rates of return. This outcome is said to be economically efficient.   14 \n 15 \nQ. What are the differences for rate- r egulated utilities?  16 \nA. For public utilities, the conditions necessary for competition to yield an efficient 17 \noutcome are not met. Customers of a regulated utility do not have a choice regarding 18 \ntheir utility service providers and cannot easily change providers in response to price 19 \nincreases the way that widget consumers can. Rather, utility customers are captive to 20 \nthe single electric or gas utility providing service where they are located. Similarly, due 21 \nto the high fixed costs necessary to operate a utility, new utilities cannot easily enter the 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 13 industry if profit levels are attractively high. For these reasons, utilities are often called 1 \nnatural monopolies. In fact, in Minnesota, electric utilities are assigned defined service 2 \nterritories and are given the exclusive right to serve customers in those territories; a 3 \ncompetitor could not try to steal an incumbent’s customers even if it wanted to.  4 \n  Abs ent some other form of intervention, utilities could exploit the monopoly 5 \npower this lack of competition gives them, charge unreasonably high prices, and 6 \ngenerate profits in excess of what competition would otherwise allow. For utilities, 7 \nregulatory agencies assume the role normally assumed by competition. This means that 8 \nregulatory agencies  must set prices and rates of return that ensure public utilities 9 \nprovide an appropriate supply of satisfactory services at reasonable rates.  10 \n  In  rate case proceedings, regulatory agencies generally attempt to set rates for 11 \nutility service that reflect a reasonable estimate of the utility’s cost of service referred to 12 \nas a “revenue requirement.”  A revenue requirement is the approximate amount of 13 \nmoney that a utility needs to collect from customers to pay all costs of service including 14 \na reasonable return for its investors. It can be expressed using the following formula:     15 \n 16 \n As shown in the formula, a revenue requirement includes a r easonable rate of return on 17 \nthe investors capital the utility has invested in its system (that is, the utility’s rate base).   18 \n 19 \nQ. What are the individual components of the rate of return?  20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 14 A. G enerally, companies, including utilities,  fund their operations with short -term debt, 1 \nlong -term debt, and equity. Each type of financing has a different level of associated 2 \nrisk, and therefore , investors require a different rate of return for each. Short- term debt 3 \nis the least risky for investors, and as a result has the lowest required rate of return.  4 \nEquity is the riskiest and has the highest required rate of return. Long -term debt falls in 5 \nbetween.    6 \n  Th e overall required rate of return for a company is the average of the required 7 \nrate of return for each of these financing sources, weighted by the amount of each 8 \nfinancing type the utility uses, and is otherwise known as the weighted average cost of 9 \ncapital (WACC) , or just the “cost of capital .” Table 1 presents the components of the 10 \noverall rate of return approved in Minnesota Power’s most recent rate case as an 11 \nexample.  12 \nTable 1 13 \nMinnesota Power’s Overall Rate of Return  14 \nAuthorized by the Commission4 15 \n 16 \n  Jus t as the required rate of return is often referred to as the cost of capital, the 17 \nrequired rates of return on debt and equity are also referred to as the cost of debt and 18 \nthe cost of equity, respectively.  I also use these terms interchangeably.   19 \n \n4 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Electric Service Rates in the State of \nMinnesota, MPUC Docket No. E015/GR -23-155, Settlement Agreement  at 3 (May 3, 2024).

H ow do companies decide what mix of debt and equity to use in their capital 1 \nstructures?  2 \nA. Capital structure decisions can be quite complex, as companies must consider several 3 \ncompeting factors.  Interest and principal payments on debt are fixed, contractual 4 \nobligations for the issuer, and are prioritized over payments to equity investors; equity 5 \ninvestors are said to have only a residual claim on a company’s earnings. Due to this 6 \nextra certainty for debt investors, the cost of debt capital is lower than the cost of 7 \nequity capital. Further, interest payments on debt are tax deductible, meaning that debt 8 \nhas tax advantages that equity does not. For these reasons, debt might seem like a 9 \nrelatively more attractive option to a company raising capital.    10 \n  Ho wever, as a company’s debt load grows, so do its fixed payment obligations. 11 \nAs the company’s fixed obligations grow, so does the risk that adverse circumstances 12 \nwill prevent the company from meeting those obligations. A failure to make a required 13 \ninterest or principal payment could potentially trigger a costly bankruptcy, which could 14 \nresult in a complete loss of value for equity investors, and significant losses for debt 15 \ninvestors. Investors will be aware of these risks and will require higher and higher 16 \nreturns on both debt and equity as the proportion of debt financing increases.  As a 17 \nresult, there is a limit on the amount of  debt a company can have before the risks 18 \nassociated with an incremental increase in debt risk start to outweigh the benefits  of its 19 \nlower cost and tax advantages .   20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 16 Q. W hat are the important implications of these dynamics?  1 \nA. There are two implications worth highlighting. First, these dynamics mean that a 2 \ncompany’s cost of debt, cost of equity, and capital structure are not independent of 3 \neach other, but rather are all interrelated. A change in a company’s capital structure will 4 \nnecessarily result in changes to both its cost of debt and its cost of equity.   5 \n  Sec ond, these dynamics mean, at least theoretically, that there is an optimal 6 \ncapital structure for each company that minimizes its after- tax weighted average cost of 7 \ncapital. Generally, starting from a very low level of debt, the incremental risk added 8 \nfrom increasing the proportion of debt in a company’s capital structure is small enough 9 \nthat the tax savings generated by the new debt more than offsets the increase in the 10 \ncosts of debt and equity that result from the increased risk. Past a certain point, 11 \nhowever, the effect of the increased risk more than offsets the incremental tax savings, 12 \nand the increasing debt causes more harm than benefit. Figure 3 below provides a basic 13 \nillustration of this relationship.  14 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 17 Figure 3  1 \nRelationship Between Capital Structure and the Cost of Capital5 2 \n 3 \n  The  Total Capital Cost line represents the average of the Equity Cost and Debt 4 \nCost lines, weighted by the proportions of debt and equity in the capital structure. At a 5 \ndebt ratio of zero ( i.e., 100 percent equity), Total Capital Cost is equal to Equity cost, as 6 \nshown where the lines meet the y -axis.  Starting from a debt ratio of zero, incremental 7 \ndebt additions reduce the total cost of capital at first, but there is a point (50 percent 8 \ndebt in this illustration) at which additional debt starts to cause the total cost of capital 9 \nto rise.  Somewhat counter -intuitively, an increase in the proportion of debt a company 10 \nuses will result in higher costs of debt and equity but could result in a lower after -tax 11 \nweighted average cost of capital.   12 \n \n5 Roger A Morin. , NEW REGULATORY FINANCE  at 454 (2006).  Note that this figure is just for illustrative purposes and is \nnot necessarily drawn to a reasonable scale.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 18 Q. A re there legitimate reasons why a company might choose a capital structure that 1 \ndoes not minimize its cost of capital?  2 \nA. Yes. For example, a company may choose to carry more equity than would be cost - 3 \nminimizing in order to maintain flexibility to issue debt on short- notice to navigate 4 \nunexpected downturns.  Alternatively, if a company knows it is going to need to issue a 5 \nsignificant amount of debt in the future to fund significant, planned capital 6 \nexpenditures, it may allow its equity ratio to rise beforehand to prevent its debt ratio 7 \nfrom getting too high when it actually issues the new debt.   8 \n  Ho wever, even in these instances, cost -minimization should be an important 9 \nconsideration, and a starting point for determining a target capital structure from which 10 \nadjustments for flexibility or other reasons are made. In his well -known textbook on 11 \nutility cost of capital, Dr. Roger Morin states “utilities should strive for a capital structure 12 \nthat minimizes the composite capital cost, including taxes.”6 Dr. Morin also states “…it is 13 \nthe responsibility of the regulators to ensure that a utility’s capital structure should 14 \nreflect a proper balance between investors’ interests and ratepayers’ interest, and 15 \nshould be cost minimizing.  …  It is also important that a reasonable safety margin 16 \nagainst possible shifts in capital market conditions and investor risk attitudes be 17 \nallowed.”7  18 \n \n6 Roger A Morin. , NEW REGULATORY FINANCE  at 455 (2006).  \n7 Roger A Morin. , NEW REGULATORY FINANCE  at  471 (2006).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 19 Q. I s it easy to determine what a company’s optimal, cost minimizing capital structure is?  1 \nA. Not with a great deal of p recision . As one popular applied corporate finance textbook 2 \nputs it, “[u]nfortunately, a clear model remains elusive.”8 Thus, these concepts are 3 \ngenerally applied at a high level in utility regulation  to ensure that utilities do not use 4 \nexcessive levels of debt or equity.  5 \n 6 \nB. PETITIONERS ’  CLAIMS REGARDING IMPROVED ACCESS TO CAPITAL  7 \nQ. What are Minnesota Power’s and ALLETE’s needs for capital over the next several 8 \nyears?  9 \nA. Minnesota Power witness Joshua D. Taran r eferenced the Company’s five -year 10 \nregulated capital expenditure forecast as reported in recent regulatory filing in a 11 \ndifferent proceeding before the Commission, which calls for $4.2 billion of capital 12 \nexpenditures for Minnesota Power’s regulated operations, plus more for ALLETE’s non - 13 \nregulated operations ( e.g., ALLETE Clean Energy and New Energy Equity). Mr. Taran 14 \nstated that this capital forecast created a need to for ALLETE to issue approximately $1 15 \nbillion of new equity, in addition to significant new debt issuances and refinancing.9  16 \n  Minn esota Power  witness  Jeffery J. Scissons  referenced a longer -term capital 17 \nforecast that includes both ALLETE’s regulated and non- regulated operations and calls 18 \nfor $20 billion of capital expenditures over the next 20 years. Mr. Scissions stated the 19 \nplanned capital expenditures will be used to “ reduce carbon, expand renewables, 20 \n \n8 Tim Koller et al., V ALUATION : MEASURING AND MANAGING THE VALUE OF COMPANIES  at 641 (7th ed. 2020) . \n9 Ex.

Does the Petition describe any binding  c ommitments by the Partners to make any 7 \nparticular amount of capital available to ALLETE over any particular timeframe?  8 \nA. No. T he  only clear, definitive statement the Petitioners  made about the meaning of 9 \n“improved access to capital” is that it does not  mean access to capital at a lower cost 10 \nthan ALLETE would have available to it if it were to remain a standalone company.12   11 \n 12 \nQ. If the Petition does not include any binding commitment, in what way s  do the 13 \nPetitioner assert  the Company’s access to capital  will be improved as a result of the 14 \ntransaction?  15 \nA. In th e  Petition, the Petitioners  asserted that the capital provided by the Partners will be 16 \nmore “flexible,” “patient,” “reliable , ” and “readily available”  than the capital currently 17 \navailable to it via the public equity markets.13 However, the meaning of these terms in 18 \nthis context is not clear, and the Petitioners  did not attempt to explain them.

For example, ALLETE stated that 9 \nits “standalone financing plan” ( i.e., assuming ALLETE were to remain in its current form 10 \nand raise the capital necessary to fund its plans on its own) would “introduce serial 11 \nequity and debt issuance risk.” ALLETE also stated that serial equity offerings may result 12 \nin an “inability to  pursue a change of control transaction for a significant period of 13 \ntime .”15 But again, the practical meaning of these asserted risks and difficulties is 14 \nunclear and unexplained in the Proxy Statement.  15 \n  Finally , in its p roxy statement, ALLETE seemed to express a concern about being 16 \nforced by a lack of access to capital to divest certain non -regulated interests, and made 17 \nclear that it would prefer to pursue financing options that would allow it to complete all 18 \nof the capital projects included in its 20 -year capital plan.16   19 \n \n14 Ex.

Please explain.  12 \nA. M r. Quackenbush asserted that i nefficiencies the public equity market can cause a 13 \npublicly traded stock to be “mispriced by the public market for noticeable periods of 14 \ntime for no discernable reason based on fundamentals .”17 In other words, a company’s  15 \nstock  can be underpriced by the public equity market (meanings its stock price is too 16 \nlow) relative to its fundamental, or true, value , sometimes also referred to as a stock’s 17 \nintrinsic value.  18 \n \n17 Ex.

What factors does Mr. Quackenbush believe can cause stocks to be mispriced in the 5 \npublic equity market?  6 \nA. Mr. Quackenbush identified s everal  drivers of mispricings : 7 \n•  “significant  t ransactional activity by short -term investors ” “who are 8 \nmore interested in short -term stock price movements than long -term fundamentals ” 9 \n“may lead to” mispricing that can “persist for noticeable periods of time” ; 10 \n• volatility during times of crisis such as the 2008 global financial crisis or 11 \nthe COVID -19 pandemic  may diminish or severely restrict capital market access ; 12 \n• investor sensitivity to quarterly earnings reports that are worse than 13 \ninvestors expect, negative news reports about a company, or adverse regulatory 14 \ndecisions can all “create unfavorable periods of time for [equity issuances] ;”  15 \n• technical factors  tha t alter the balance of supply and demand for a 16 \nparticular stock, such as activity by a large investor, changing investor demographics, 17 \nshort -term momentum trends, and liquidity constraints can all impact a stock’s price at 18 \nany point in time ; 19 \n \n18 Ex.

What does M r. Taran discuss in his testimony?  5 \nA. Mr. Taran echoed Mr. Quackenbush’s concerns, stating “[w]hen the Company needs to 6 \naccess equity markets, it becomes vulnerable to economic cycles, geopolitical events, 7 \ninterest rate volatility, and other influencing factors .”20 Mr. Taran also stated that 8 \n“[p]ublic equity investors and analysts are often focused on the near term and do not 9 \ngive credit to long -term growth projections or project announcements.”21  10 \n  My u nderstanding is that these mispricing events represent the “volatility” the 11 \nPetitioners  referred to in the Petition, and lack of stock price volatility, which affects the 12 \namount of capital a company raises from an issuance of a given number of new shares 13 \nof stock, is what makes private equity capital a more “reliable” source of equity.  14 \n  In  addition, Mr. Taran noted that as a participant in the public equity market, 15 \nALLETE “is in direct competition with other publicly traded companies pursuing the 16 \nsame finite pool of investment dollars,” whereas the substantial assets that CPP 17 \nInvestments and GIP have under management (CAD$632.3 billion and $115 billion, 18 \n \n19 Ex.

Did any of the Petitioners  w itness es provide further clarity with respect to the 4 \n“patience ,” “flexibility ,” or ready availability of the Partners’ capital, as referenced in 5 \nthe Petition?  6 \nA. Yes. Mr. Taran noted that ALLETE’s current public shareholders expect consistent 7 \nquarterly dividend payments, whereas because the Partners  are more patient than 8 \npublic equity investors, they will not require regular dividend payments, and instead will 9 \nallow the Company to reinvest as equity the cash it would otherwise have paid out as 10 \ndividends.23  11 \n  Mr.  Taran  also described the costs and processes associated with equity 12 \nissuances by publicly held  companies that would be avoided with private equity, which 13 \nmakes private equity capital more readily available.24  14 \n  In a ddition, Mr. Quackenbush stated that the private equity is more flexible with 15 \nrespect to the size of equity issuances, and therefore may allow ALLETE to more readily 16 \nmaintain a balanced capital structure.25   17 \n \n22 Ex MP -__ at 12,17 (Taran Direct).  \n23 Ex.

D id Mr. Quackenbush and Mr. Taran raise any other concerns about Minnesota 1 \nPower’s ability to access capital in its current corporate form?  2 \nA. Yes. Both witnesses asserted that ALLETE’s relatively small size and th e nature of its 3 \ncustomer base  pose challenges to its ability to access capital. Mr. Quackenbush stated 4 \nthat some investors have minim um size requirements for the companies they invest in, 5 \nand some companies are simply too small for those investors to invest in, limiting the 6 \namount of capital available to the small companies.26  7 \n 8 \nC. ANALYSIS OF ASSERTED  CA PITAL NEEDS AND  IMPROVED ACCESS TO CAPITAL  9 \nQ. Is the magnitude of ALLETE’s equity capital need o ver the next several years clear? 10 \nA. No. While it seems likely that ALLETE, if it remains a publicly traded company, will need 11 \nto issue shares of equity it  seems to have different capital forecasts that would likely 12 \nlead to very different needs for new equity.  13 \n  As  noted above , Mr. Taran and Mr. Scissons discussed two different capital 14 \nforecasts , one from Minnesota Power’s recent capital structure filing with the 15 \nCommission, and one referenced in the Company’s Proxy Statement (the “Capital 16 \nStructure Forecast” and the “Proxy Statement Forecast,” respectively).  17 \n  The  Company provided the underlying detail s of the Proxy Statement Forecast in 18 \ndiscovery , and it  is markedly different  over the period 2024- 2028  than the Capital 19 \nStructure Forecast.  20 \n \n26 Ex.

Nearly all of the variance in 2 \nthese forecasts is driven by variance in ALLETE’s non-regulated capital expenditures . 3 \nEach year, t he Company has forecasted large  non-regulated  capital expenditures that 4 \ndid not materialize . 5 \n 6 \nQ. What do you conclude from your review of this data?  7 \nA. As no ted  above, ALLETE has stated that the primary reason it is pursuing the transaction 8 \nis its concern about its ability to access the capital necessary to fund its capital plans in 9 \nthe public equity market. However, the amount of capital the Company might need over 10 \nthe next five years seems to be subject to a high level of uncertainty. Moreover, in the 11 \nProxy Statement, the Company stated th e amount of new equity expected to be issued 12 \nper the Proxy Statement Forecast is “within reasonable limits” for ALLETE.30 If ALLETE’s 13 \nactual capital spending more closely matches the capital structure forecast, raising the 14 \nequity capital needed to fund it should be much easier,  and lessen the importance or 15 \nneed for  ALLETE to improve  its access to capital. Given that biggest difference between 16 \nthe two forecasts lies in the forecast for non -regulated operations, which the Company 17 \nhas a history of significantly over forecasting , this seems like a realistic possibility.  18 \n  I a ddress other reasons why ALLETE’s capital needs may be different than its 19 \nstated forecasts below.  20 \n 21 \n \n30 Ex.

D o you agree with Mr. Quackenbush’s and Mr. Taran’s concerns about stock market 1 \nvolatility and mispricing?  2 \nA. No. Mr . Quackenbush and Mr. Taran greatly overstate the likelihood that ALLETE’s stock 3 \nwill be mispriced, and to the extent such mispricings do occur, it is not clear that being 4 \nprivately held will mitigate the associated risks.  5 \n 6 \nQ. What evidence or analysis did Mr. Quackenbush provide to support his assertion that 7 \npublicly traded stocks can be mispriced for “noticeable periods of time”?  8 \nA. Mr. Quackenbush provided no support for this assertion.  9 \n 10 \nQ. Why do you  b elieve he overstates the risks of stock mispricings? 11 \nA. In considering this issue, I distinguish between three different types of mispricing events  12 \n(each of which Mr. Quackenbush referenced somewhat indirectly in his direct 13 \ntestimony) : (a) events that affect a the stock of a single company, such as investor 14 \noverreaction to a worse -than- expected quarterly earnings report or regulatory decision , 15 \nor a failure by investors to appropriately value future growth prospects ; (b) broad 16 \nmoves in the stock market that affect most publicly traded stocks, such as the extended 17 \ndownturn  that occurred  in the wake of the great financial crisis; and (c) significant  18 \nemergency events like the freezing of the commercial paper market in March 2020 in 19 \nresponse to the COVID- 19 pandemic that Mr. Quackenbush in  his direct testimony.31 20 \n 21 \n \n31 Ex.

P lease address Mr. Quackenbush’s concerns about single -company events.  1 \n  Wi th respect to  concerns about persistent value disruptions of a single 2 \ncompany ’s stock price, I do not agree that this is a significant concern. T he stock market 3 \nis largely efficient, meaning that most of the time, a stock’s price reasonably reflects the 4 \n“fundamental factors that drive equity valuations over the long run,” as Mr. 5 \nQuackenbush phrased it. In the popular corporate finance textbook Valuation, written 6 \nby experts at McKinsey & Company, the authors state:  7 \n[T]he impact of short- te rm earnings on share prices should 8 \nnot be overstated  . . . . Investors place far more importance 9 \non a company’s economic fundamentals than on reported 10 \nearnings . . . . [T]he announcement of lower -than- expected 11 \nearnings only drives share prices down in case of downward 12 \nrevisions of long -term fundamental prospects.32 13 \n The authors also state:  14 \nSenior executives often claim that the stock market 15 \nundervalues or “doesn’t appreciate” their company. They 16 \nsay this not just in public, where you would expect them to, 17 \nbut also in private. They truly believe that if only they had 18 \ndifferent investors, or if only the investors or analysts 19 \nunderstood their company better, the company’s share 20 \nprice would be higher [.] 21 \nIn practice, we typically find that no significant gap exists 22 \n[between the company’s intrinsic, or fundamental, value 23 \nand its stock market value] or that any gap can be explained 24 \nby the company’s historical performance relative to its 25 \npeers or by the way the market is valuing the entire 26 \nindustry.33 27 \n 28 \n \n32 Tim Koller et al., V ALUATION : MEASURING AND MANAGING THE VALUE OF COMPANIES  at 117 (7th ed. 2020).  \n33 Tim Koller et al., V ALUATION : MEASURING AND MANAGING THE VALUE OF COMPANIES  at 669 (7th ed. 2020).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 32 Q. D o you agree with Mr. Taran’s concern that investors and analysts d o not give credit 1 \nto long -term growth projections ? 2 \nA. No. Harvard Law Professor Lucian A. Bebchuk  a ddressed this idea succinctly in a recent 3 \narticle:  4 \nIf investors were systematically underestimating long -te rm 5 \nprospects, growth companies would tend to trade at 6 \ndiscounted levels, enabling their investors to obtain higher 7 \nreturns over the long term. But the empirical evidence 8 \nindicates that growth stocks actually tend to offer lower 9 \nreturns over the long term —and thus, if anything, tend to 10 \ntrade at elevated levels —compared with stocks whose 11 \nvaluations are grounded in current profitability.  12 \nAmazon and Netflix vividly illustrate that when appropriate, 13 \ninvestors will accept with considerable patience a corporate 14 \nstrategy of investing in the long term at the expense of no 15 \nor little current profit. Over the past decade the stock prices 16 \nof those companies appreciated steeply, rising more than 17 \n20-fold and 10 -fold respectively, even though their growth - 18 \noriented strategies resulted in relatively small profits along 19 \nthe way.  20 \nOf course, some corporate leaders may take the view that 21 \nthe market doesn’t adequately appreciate the long -term 22 \nprospects of their companies and consequently underprices 23 \ntheir stock. But such reactions may simply reflect the 24 \ntendency of those individuals to overvalue or defend their 25 \nown performance. Even if a stock market price disappoints 26 \na company’s leaders, it may in fact accurately reflect the 27 \ncompany’s long -term prospects.34 28 \n Thus, contrary to Mr. Taran’s claim, investors do appropriately c onsider the value of 29 \nfuture growth in determining how much they are willing to pay for a stock in the 30 \npresent , and in some situations,  will tolerate lower near term profits . 31 \n \n34  Bebchuk Lucian A.

Are there any other reasons why you do  not agree with Mr. Quackenbush’s and Mr. 2 \nTaran’s concerns?  3 \nA. Yes. If the  public equity market regularly allowed for the types of inefficiencies  Mr. 4 \nQuackenbush and Mr. Taran expressed concern about, savvy investors would be able to 5 \ntake advantage by buying the affected stocks when the ir prices dip ped, earning excess 6 \nreturns as the stock  prices  rebounded. But investors rarely earn returns in excess of 7 \npassive market benchmarks  like the S&P 500 I ndex, and a large majority of active 8 \ninvestors underperform the larger market . S&P Global recently released a study 9 \nshowing that more than 90 percent actively managed U.S. equity funds have 10 \nunderperformed a passively managed benchmark, both over the past ten years and the 11 \npast three  years.35 That is because stocks are nearly always priced efficiently, and in the 12 \nunlikely event that one is not, such mispricings are so difficult to identify that it would 13 \nnot be reasonable for a company to limit its share issuances based on an assumption its 14 \nstock is underpriced, because the company would probably be wrong.  15 \n  Wi th respect to broader market  downturns  that affect many stocks , it may seem 16 \nobvious in hindsight, after stock prices have recovered, that stock prices were too low.  17 \nHowever, if it were clear that prices were too low during the downturn, investors would 18 \nhave started buying, driving prices upward sooner. If investors collectively cannot spot 19 \nsuch mispricings, corporate finance managers likely cannot, either.  20 \n \n35 SPIVA® Global Mid -Year 2024 Scorecard . S&P Global. October 7, 2024.

Capital tends to flow to the investments that 2 \nprovide the highest expected returns for given levels of risk. If equity in publicly traded 3 \ncompanies gets temporarily discounted by a broad market move downward, investors 4 \nwith capital available would likely prefer to invest in those companies  because they 5 \nwould be able to do so at a discounted price.  Privately held companies whose equity is 6 \nnot discounted in the same way  would not be as attractive an investment.   7 \n  In a ddition, during broad -based market downturn, real economic activity is often 8 \naffected along with stock prices, and Minnesota Power ’s ratepayers will likely  be 9 \nnegatively impacted as well.  As a result, t he need and timing of currently planned  10 \ncapital projects would likely need to be reevaluated anyway, as the Company’s load may 11 \nfall, or in response to affordability concerns.   12 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 35 Q. W hat about Mr. Quackenbush’s and Mr. Taran’s concerns about broader , more severe 1 \nevents such as the March 2020 lock-up of the commercial paper market as a result of 2 \nthe onset of the COVID -19 pandemic?  3 \nA. In March 2020, the market for commercial paper ( de bt with very short  maturities ) 4 \nseized and prevented issuers from refinancing, or rolling their  debt over, creating a 5 \nsignificant threat of defaults. While I agree that it is important for companies to plan for 6 \nthese types of emergency events, being taken private is not an answer for these 7 \nsituations. Even private equity firms could struggle to provide capital their portfolio 8 \ncompanies at the speed at which that event unfolded. Instead, companies  guard against 9 \nthese types of events with credit facilities . Companies pay significant fees and premiums 10 \nto banks for the right to force the banks to provide cash on demand. If a company were 11 \nunfortunate enough to be planning for a stock sale when such an event occurred, its 12 \ncredit facility should provide enough temporary liquidity to delay the sale until the 13 \ncapital markets recover.  And to the extent such a significant emergency event persisted, 14 \nthe Company’s capital expenditure plans would need to be reevaluated, as the 15 \nCompany’s customers and suppliers would also be facing very difficult circumstances.  16 \n 17 \nQ. More generally, d o  you agree the types of stock mispricings referenced by Mr. 18 \nQuackenbush amount to limitations on companies access to capital?  19 \nA. No. Contrary to Mr. Quackenbush’s assertion that a depressed stock price may limit the 20 \nproceeds of a stock s ale to an amount less than what the company needs, efficient 21 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 36 functioning of the stock market causing a c o mpany’s stock price to fall is precisely the 1 \nmechanism that ensures it retains access to equity capital.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Please explain.  4 \nA. The stock market sets equity prices such that the expected return on buying a particular 5 \nstock is equal to the return equity investors require, which is based on the riskiness of 6 \nthe stock. If a stock’s price was “too low,” the expected return on the stock would be 7 \nhigher than investors require, and investors would start to buy the stock. By buying the 8 \nstock, they would drive its price up to the point where the expected return equals the 9 \nrequired return. If a stock’s price start out “too high,” then the expected return of 10 \nholding the stock will be lower than the required return, and investors would sell, 11 \ndriving the price down.  12 \n  Similarly,  if the expected long -run earnings of a company decrease, but its stock 13 \nprice does not fall commensurately, the expected return on the stock would be too low 14 \nfor new investors to be willing to buy it and provide equity capital to the company. In 15 \nthat case, the company’s access to equity capital would be limited.  16 \n  Mr.  Quackenbush’s and Mr. Taran’s concern is different, and relates less to a 17 \ncompany’s ability  to access equity capital, and more to its willingness to access equity 18 \ncapital.   19 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 37 Q. P lease continue.  1 \nA. If a stock’s price is equal to its fundamental value, then issuing new shares to fund 2 \nquality projects with expected earnings comparable to the company’s current expected 3 \nearnings should have no impact on the value of the company’s currently outstanding  4 \nshares. But if a company’s stock price is truly below its fundamental, or intrinsic, value, 5 \nissuing shares results in a transfer of wealth from the company’s existing shareholders 6 \nto its new shareholders, as for a given amount of total equity capital, the new 7 \nshareholders acquire more shares than they would if the stock was priced “correctly.” 8 \nThis gives the new shareholders a larger percentage claim on the company’s future 9 \nearnings than they would otherwise get at the expense of the claims of existing 10 \nshareholders.  11 \n  If  a company’s stock is priced below its fundamental value, new investors would 12 \nbe eager to provide new equity capital. But the board of directors and company 13 \nmanagement represent existing shareholders, not potential future shareholders , and 14 \nwould likely be reluctant to issue new equity because of the harm, or loss of wealth, 15 \nthat would be incurred by existing shareholders.  The company would likely be able to 16 \naccess the capital needed to fund its planned projects,  but management may choose 17 \nnot to do so to protect the interests of existing shareholders.  However, as described 18 \nabove, when corporate managers think their company’s stock price is too low, they are 19 \nprobably wrong.   20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 38 Q.

For example, wind or solar projects that Minnesota Power 3 \nassumes it will own in its capital plan could be owned by third parties and used to serve 4 \nthe Company’s ratepayers via power purchase agreements  (PPA) . The Commission’s 5 \nOrder in Minnesota Power’s most recent Integrated Resource Plan includes a 6 \nrequirement that the Company acquire 300 to 400 megawatts (MW) of wind by 2030, 7 \nand requires that Minnesota Power include the option for PPAs in any request for 8 \nproposal it issues unless it can explain why a PPA is not feasible.38  9 \n  T he Proxy Statement capital forecast includes [TRADE SECRET  10 \n 11 \n 12 \n.39 TRADE SECRET ENDS]   13 \n  Similarly, o ther utilities could take over the Company’s interest in certain of its 14 \nplanned transmission projects.  15 \n 16 \nQ.

Do you agree with Mr. Taran’s concerns about ALLETE’s size and the composition of 1 \nMinnesota Power’s customer base? 2 \nA. No. The Company identified no instances in the past in which it was unable to access the 3 \ncapital markets when it needed to, despite its size and customer base.44 This is also in 4 \nspite of the fact that the investment fund Mr. Quackenbush managed would not invest 5 \nin ALLETE because it was too small.45 Different investment funds have different 6 \nstrategies and pursue different investments. While Mr. Quackenbush’s fund may not 7 \nhave been willing to invest in ALLETE, plenty of other investors were.  8 \n  Th is issue is addressed clearly in Valuation, the corporate finance textbook cited 9 \nearlier:  10 \nMany executives are tempted by the illusion that the 11 \nabsolute size or scale of a company brings benefits in the 12 \nform of either higher share prices in the stock market….  13 \n However, there is no evidence that size matters 14 \nonce companies have reached a certain size.

Are there reasons to be concerned that ALLETE might have less access to capital as a 5 \nprivately held company than it does now as a publicly held company?  6 \nA. Yes. A point commonly made by utility witnesses in rate cases is that utilities that are 7 \nparts of larger corporate structures and must compete for capital with the other 8 \noperating units in their corporate structures. Minnesota Power witness Ann Bulkley has 9 \nargued this point multiple times in testimonies before the Minnesota Public Utilities 10 \nCommission.48 I generally do not agree with those arguments, because the utilities in 11 \nquestion are nearly always part of publicly traded companies that can issue new shares 12 \nto raise capital if necessary. The pool of capital those companies have available to 13 \ndistribute to their operating units is therefore not limited to internally generated funds. 14 \nInstead, the capital available to them is all of the capital available in the public equity 15 \nmarket, which is vast, deep, and liquid. Any investor with available capital and a desire 16 \nto invest could provide capital. If ALLETE in its current form tries to raise equity in the 17 \npublic market and one or two, or a hundred potential investors decide not to invest, 18 \n \n47 Ex.

Access to such a deep pool of capital 1 \nis a main point and large benefit of being a publicly traded company.  2 \n  If  this transaction is approved, however, ALLETE may wind up in exactly the 3 \nposition utility witnesses often warn about. Post -transaction,  it will be solely dependent 4 \non Alloy Parent for equity capital. Alloy Parent, in turn, will generally have three 5 \npotential sources of capital it can invest as equity in ALLETE: proceeds from its own debt 6 \nissuances, equity capital from GIP -controlled funds, and equity capital from CPP 7 \nInvestments. If Alloy Parent is in a distressed situation such that it cannot issue its own 8 \ndebt to raise capital, and GIP and CPP Investments are unable or unwilling to provide 9 \nequity capital to Alloy Parent, ALLETE will not have access to equity capital.  10 \n  The  Partners stated that in such a situation, ALLETE would be able to issue 11 \npreferred shares if additional equity is needed, but preferred equity is different from 12 \ncommon equity (which is often referred to simply as “equity”), and often has bond- like 13 \nqualities such as required dividend payments that mimic required interest payments on 14 \ndebt.49  15 \n 16 \nQ. Why might GIP or CPP Investments be unwilling or unable to provide more equity 17 \ncapital to Alloy Parent?  18 \nA. The Partners may be unwilling to provide equity capital for any number of reasons. Most 19 \nsimply, they may determine that they have other, better investment opportunities 20 \nelsewhere.  21 \n \n49 Ex.

As Jonathan  Bram of GIP described in his testimony, GIP Fund 2 \nV is targeting capital commitments from investors totaling $25 billion, and once it hits 3 \nthat target, no new capital or investors will be introduced.50 The fund’s $25 billion in 4 \ncapital commitments plus any internally generated funds from its portfolio companies 5 \nwill be the entire pool of capital from which it will be able to make equity investments in 6 \nits portfolio companies. Mr. Bram asserted that GIP will retain enough capital to support 7 \nthe needs of its portfolio companies throughout the life if its investments in them, but 8 \nhas provided no explanation or analysis demonstrating how it ensures it will have 9 \nenough capital. If, a few years in the future, the capital needs of its portfolio companies 10 \nexceed its initial expectations, or its internally generated cash flows fall short of 11 \nexpectations, there are no guarantees that GIP Fund V will be willing or able to provide 12 \nenough equity for Minnesota Power to make its needed investment.51  13 \n   [HIGH LY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET BEGINS  14 \n 15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n50 Ex.

Does Mr. Taran address this issue correctly in his direct testimony?  5 \nA. No. I think this is a significant issue that Mr. Taran gets exactly backwards. As noted 6 \nabove, he stated that publicly traded companies compete for a finite pool of capital, 7 \nwhereas the large amounts of assets GIP and CPP Investments have under management 8 \nhelp assure access to capital for ALLETE. However, ALLETE will not have access to the full 9 \n$115 billion GIP has under management.  It will only have access to the $25 billion 10 \nexpected to be committed to GIP Fund V, and realistically it will have access to only a 11 \nfraction of that committed capital as it will have to compete with the fund’s other 12 \ninvestments for it.53 I am not aware of any similar hard limits for CPP Investments, but 13 \nas described above, CPP Investments has soft limits on the amount of its total capital it 14 \nwants invested in private equity, and within its private equity investments may want to 15 \nlimit its exposure to any single investment.  16 \n  Eve n if it were the case that ALLETE would have access to all of the capital the 17 \nPartners’ have under management, it would still be a much smaller pool of capital than 18 \nthe public equity market. And ALLETE will not have access to anywhere close to the full 19 \namount of the Partners’ assets under management.   20 \n \n52 Ex. DOC -__, CMA -D-12 at 153 (Addonizio Direct) . \n53 Ex.

W hat do you conclude about the risk that ALLETE may have worse access to capital if 1 \nthe Acquisition is approved?  2 \nA. I conclude that there are realistic scenarios in which ALLETE’s and Minnesota Power’s 3 \naccess to capital would be more limited under private ownership than it would be with 4 \npublic ownership.  5 \n 6 \nQ. What do you conclude about the Acquisition’s expected impact on ALLETE’s and 7 \nMinnesota Power’s access to capital?  8 \nA. The P etitioners  have provided little to no reason to expect that the Acquisition will 9 \nmeaningfully improve Minnesota Power’s access to capital. T heir largest stated  concern, 10 \nregarding stock market volatility and market inefficiencies, is unsupported by evidence 11 \nor analysis and is contrary to accepted financial theory  and evidence from investor 12 \nreturns . The Acquisition does not mitigate the concerns the Company has expressed 13 \nabout needing to divest non -regulated assets or its ability to issue  debt going forward as 14 \na standalone company.   15 \n  The refore, I conclude that the Commission should not consider improved access 16 \nto capital as a potential benefit when considering whether the proposed Acquisition is 17 \nconsistent with the public interest.   18 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 47 D.

Do you have any concerns about Minnesota Power’s ability to manage its business 4 \nand affairs if the Acquisition is not approved?  5 \nA. No. A s Minnesota Power witness Jennifer Cady noted, ALLETE is the largest investor in 6 \nrenewable energy of all publicly traded utilities in the United States relative to market 7 \ncapitalization, and therefore already has  some  experience with  large  capital expenditure 8 \nplans.58 And as noted above, because of the quality of Minnesota Power’s current 9 \nmanagement , the Partners  expect to leave it in place, meaning the Company’s 10 \nmanagement team will likely be the same  regardless of whether the Acquisition is 11 \napproved.  12 \n 13 \nQ. What do you conclude about the potential benefits to the public interest of gaining 14 \naccess to the expertise of the Partners via the proposed Acquisition?  15 \nA. Because Minnesota Power already has quality, competent management, the Company’s 16 \nleadership team as a standalone company is likely to the same as it would be the 17 \nCompany were to be taken private,  and the Partners’ have represented to the 18 \nCommission they have no plans for significant operational changes, I conclude that 19 \naccess to the Partners’ expertise is not a meaningful benefit that might arise as a result 20 \n \n57 Ex.

If  the Acquisition poses any potential risks to ratepayers or 11 \nthe public interest, it will not be consistent with the public interest, as is required for 12 \napproval by Minn.

PETITIONERS ’ A SSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE ACQUISITION ON 11 \nMINNESOTA POWER’S COST OF CAPITAL  12 \nQ. Did the Petitioners discuss the potential ef fects  of the proposed Acquisition on 13 \nMinnesota Power’s cost of capital?  14 \nA. Yes,  in part . The expected effects of the proposed Acquisition on Minnesota Power’s 15 \ncost of capital was the main topic of Minnesota Power  witness Ann Bulkley , and other 16 \nwitnesses briefly addressed it  as well.  The Company and the Partners also mentioned 17 \nthis issue in the Petition.  18 \n  Ho wever, as described above, a utility’s cost of capital is a function of its cost of 19 \ndebt, its cost of equity, and the mix  of debt and equity it uses to finance its operations , 20 \nor its capital structure . But the discussion of Minnesota Power’s cost of capital in Ms. 21 \nBulkley’s testimony and in the  Petition was largely limited to effects on Minnesota 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 51 Power’s cost of equity. As I explain below, while Minnesota Power’s cost of equity may 1 \nincrease as a result of the Acquisition , I believe the methods the Commission has 2 \nhistorically used to estimate the cost of equity for ratemaking purposes, if applied 3 \nappropriately , can mitigate the risk that ratepayers are forced to bear higher costs as a 4 \nresult. However, I conclude that the proposed acquisition also could potentially increase 5 \nMinnesota Power’s cost of debt, a concern the Petitioners  did not directly address.   6 \n 7 \nQ. What ef fects does Ms. Bulkley expect the proposed Acquisition to have on Minnesota 8 \nPower’s cost of equity?  9 \nA. Ms. Bulkley stated  th at the Acquisition will have no effect on Minnesota Power’s cost of 10 \nequity . In short, Ms. Bulkley stated that  the expected return required by equity investors 11 \nfor a particular investment is based on the risk of the investment, not the source of the 12 \ncapital.  Ms. Bulkley testified that because Minnesota Power’s operations will not change 13 \nas a result of the Acquisition, the risks associated with an investment in Minnesota 14 \nPower will not change, and therefore the market -required return on equity invested in 15 \nthe Company will not change.59  16 \n  Furt her, b ecause the cost of equity will not change as a result of private 17 \nownership, Ms. Bulkley stated that post -Acquisition, it will be  reasonable to continue to 18 \nuse the same methods to determine the authorized return on equity to reflect in the 19 \nCompany’s rates that the Commission has previously used.60  20 \n \n59 Ex.

W hat did other Company or Partner witnesses say?  1 \nA. In the Petition, the Company and the Partners conveyed a message similar to Ms. 2 \nBulkley’s. They stated “ [l]ike other investors, private infrastructure investors such as the 3 \nPartners seek a reasonable return on their  investments and a reasonable opportunity to 4 \nearn that return. ”61 In addition, t he Company and the Partners state d: 5 \nThe methodology for determining the cost of  c apital, or 6 \nequity specifically, for a regulated utility company does not 7 \nchange based on public versus private  ownership, because 8 \nboth scenarios continue to involve comparisons to proxy 9 \ngroups and models based on those proxy  groups. Further, 10 \nALLETE will still have a credit rating and be subject to credit 11 \nrating agency reports that provide  transparency and insight 12 \ninto the financial health of the utility. ”62 13 \n  Mr . Bram echoed these sentiment s in his testimony,  stating  that in evaluating 14 \npotential investments, GIP evaluates whether the investment will provide an 15 \n“opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return” and “will earn reasonable regulated 16 \nreturns over time.”63  17 \n  Mr . Quackenbush stated that “private market long -term utility investors” like the 18 \nPartners “generally seek the same lower risk attributes in their investments as public 19 \nmarket long -term investors: low volatility, stability, certainty, and predictability, along 20 \nwith modest returns. Like long term -public market investors, they would look toward 21 \nother non -utility sectors if their goal was outsized returns. ”64   22 \n \n61 Ex. MP- __ at 16 (Petition).  \n62 Ex.

D o you agree that Minnesota Power’s cost of capital will not change as a result of the 1 \nproposed Acquisition?  2 \nA. N o. I do not agree with Mr. Quackenbush’s assertion that private eq uity investors seek 3 \nthe same investment attributes as public equity investors. Private equity investors 4 \ngenerally seek higher investment returns than public equity investors and try to achieve 5 \nthose higher returns by taking a more active role in the management of the companies 6 \nthey invest in and implementing changes in the financial structure and operations 7 \nintended to increase returns to equity investors.  Some of the  strategies private equity 8 \ninvestors employ to increase investment returns , for example a significant increase in 9 \nthe amount of debt financing, may  raise the cost of capital of the companies they invest 10 \nin. If the Partners were to use similar strategies to increase the returns they earn from 11 \ntheir investments in Alloy (and, indirectly, ALLETE and Minnesota Power), it would likely 12 \nincrease Minnesota Power’s cost of capital, and result in rates for utility service that are 13 \nhigher than they otherwise would have been.  14 \n  B ec ause of the nature of how the required return on equity is estimated in utility 15 \nrate cases, the Commission will likely be able to mitigate the effects of potential 16 \nincreases in Minnesota Power’s cost of equity, but potential increases to the Company’s 17 \ncost of debt will be much harder to identify, measure, and adjust for. For this reason, I 18 \nagree  with  Ms. Bulkley’s conclusion that the methods the Commission has historically 19 \nrelied on to determine Minnesota Power’s authorized return on equity will still be 20 \nreasonable to use post- Acquisition. However, I do not agree with all of the reasoning 21 \nshe used to reach that conclusion.  22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 54 B. D IFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EQUITY INVESTORS  1 \nQ. Would you please clarify what entities you are referring to when you use the term 2 \n“private equity investors”?  3 \nA. As described in Mr. Bram’s testimony, GIP is a private equity manager that establishe s  4 \nfunds with capital provided by other investors such as pension funds , insurance 5 \ncompanies  and high -net-worth individuals. I use the term “private equity investors” to 6 \ndescribe the investors that provide the capital used to make the investments.  For 7 \nexample, the California Public Employees’ Retirements System (CalPERS), the investor 8 \nproviding capital to Tower Bridge, which will own 20 percent of Alloy, is a “private 9 \nequity investor,” as are the limited partner investors who have committed capital to GIP 10 \nFund V.  11 \n  I us e the term “private equity funds” to refer to the entities established to make 12 \nand hold the private equity investments. With respect to GIP ’s involvement in this 13 \ntransaction, GIP Fund V and Tower Bridge are the relevant “private equity funds.”  14 \n  Finally , I use the term “private equity managers” to refer to the entities that 15 \nmanage, meaning  make the investment decisions on behalf of, the private equity funds. 16 \nGIP is a private equity manager as it makes the investment decisions of GIP Fund V and 17 \nTower Bridge . 18 \n  Similarly , C PP Investments is a private equity manager, “CPP Alloy Partner” is a 19 \nprivate equity fund, and Canada Pension Plan is a private equity investor.65   20 \n \n65 Ex.

W hy do you believe that private equity investors seek different investment attributes 1 \nthan public equity investors?  2 \nA. The investment attributes and risk/reward profile of private equity are different enough 3 \nfrom public equity that the two are considered separate asset classes (other types of 4 \nbroad asset classes include, for example, bonds, real estate, commodities, etc.).  5 \n  CalP ERS’ and CPP Investments’ target asset allocation s for the funds the manage 6 \nare reported  in Tables 4 and 5 below .

The loss of control 8 \nresulting from this inability to sell their private equity holdings, or illiquidity, creates 9 \nextra risk for the investors, as they may be unable to access their capital if they need it. 10 \nPrivate equity investors also usually pay significant fees to the fund managers they 11 \ncommit capital to – a commonly cited, representative example is two percent of the 12 \n \n67 CPP Investments Annual Report 2024.

Do es Cal PERS discuss what it sees as the differences between private and public 6 \nequity?  7 \nA. Yes.  As shown in Table 4 a bove , CalPERS recently increased its target allocation of 8 \nprivate equity investments from 13 percent of its assets to 17 percent (up from 8 9 \npercent in 2022) and a decrease in its public equity investments from 42 percent to 37 10 \npercent. In a press release announcing the change, CalPERs stated that it was “[m]oving 11 \nto seize market opportunities and maximize returns from the highest performing asset 12 \nclasses” and that the CalPERS Investment Office “ concluded that private equity remains 13 \nthe asset class with the highest expected long -term total return [.]”68  14 \n 15 \nQ.

In order for 14 \nprivate equity fund managers to provide post- fee returns (or net returns) that are higher 15 \nthan returns available from public equity markets  to their private equity investors , the  16 \npre-fee (or gross) returns earned at the fund level must be even higher.  17 \n 18 \nQ. Generally, h ow do  private equity fund managers attempt to generate the high returns 19 \nneeded to meet their investors’ expectations?  20 \nA.

Wha t a re “financial engineering, governance engineering and operational 11 \nengineering”?  12 \nA. Financial engineering is the adjustment of a firm’s capital structure, or the percentages 13 \nand types of equity and debt the firm finances itself with, to increase the total value of 14 \nthe firm. Interest payments on debt are tax deductible, so replacing equity with debt 15 \ncreates tax savings (via the deductibility of the incremental interest expense on the new 16 \ndebt) that may increase profits for equity holders.72 Increased use of debt is also 17 \nthought to impose discipline on company management by creating fixed payment 18 \nobligations (higher interest payments) that prevent management from engaging in 19 \nwasteful, value -destroying activities, although I do not believe this aspect of financial 20 \nengineering applies to regulated utilities as strongly as it does to non -regulated firms.  21 \n \n71 Paul A.

While there may be notable dispersion in returns expected by different investors, two 16 \nreasonable benchmarks for estimating the expected returns on investments in utility 17 \nstocks are authorized returns on equity from regulatory commissions around the 18 \ncountry, and estimates of expected long -run returns on US equities generally ( i.e., not 19 \njust utility stocks).  20 \n \n73 Gompers and Kaplan at 131.  \n74 Gompers and Kaplan at 148.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 61   S &P Global recently reported that there were 55 ROE determinations by 1 \nregulatory bodies for electric utilities in 2024, ranging from 9.20 percent to 10.50 2 \npercent, with an average of 9.74 percent.75  3 \n  Ho wever, as I have discussed in prior testimonies before the Commission, 4 \nauthorized ROE s likely overstate the return expectations of utility investors.

Yes,  particularly financial engineering.

How might financial engineering increase Minnesota Power’s cost of capital?  7 \nA. Alloy  wi ll own no assets or investments  other than ALLETE , meaning that all of the 8 \nincremental interest and principal payments on debt issued by Alloy  or ALLETE 9 \n(“incremental debt”) will ultimately need to be paid for by cash flows generated by 10 \nALLETE (and primarily Minnesota Power, which currently represent s roughly 70 percent 11 \nof ALLETE).88 Any financial pressure or distress created by  incremental leverage  not 12 \nassociated with one of ALLETE’s other lines of business  will put pressure on Minnesota 13 \nPower . If the incremental debt load becomes too large, or interest rates rise such that 14 \nAlloy  or ALLETE  has trouble refinancing  the extra  debt  when it expires , Alloy  may try to 15 \nextract cash from Minnesota Power  to pay the incremental debt  down .   16 \n  Whi le the Partners  would be  limited in how they can extract cash from ALLETE 17 \n(e.g., they cannot sell assets or issue large amounts of debt without prior Commission 18 \napproval), they  can direct ALLETE to increase an incremental amount of debt in its 19 \nregulated capital structure  within the range allowed by the Commission, cut 20 \nmaintenance budgets , or forgo capital expenditures and use the proceeds or savings  to 21 \n \n88 Ex.

Investors would likely perceive any such actions as increasing the 1 \nrisk associated with investments in ALLETE or Minnesota Power that would lead them to 2 \nincrease the expected returns on investments in ALLETE they require.  3 \n  Pre cisely for these types of reasons, the credit ratings agencies, when 4 \ndetermining a credit rating for a company, consider the influence of the company’s 5 \nparents and affiliates have on the company itself. For example, in one of its ratings 6 \nmethodology documents, S&P Global Ratings states:  7 \nThe determination of [stand -alo ne credit profile] includes ongoing 8 \ninteraction or influence, whether beneficial (positive), neutral, or 9 \nburdensome (negative) … We consider that groups, including 10 \nowners and affiliates, influence the [stand -alone credit profile]  11 \nwhen there are regular interactions with the issuer.89 12 \n  S&P  cites double leverage ( i.e., when a parent entity issues debt and invests the 13 \nproceeds of that debt as equity in a subsidiary), higher shareholder distribution policies, 14 \nand aggressive financial expectations from owners as examples of negative influences 15 \non a company’s stand -alone credit profile (and on its actual credit rating).  16 \n  R ing-fe ncing measures do not eliminate these risks.   17 \n \n89 General Criteria: Stand- Alone Credit Profiles: One Component o f A Rating , S&P Global Ratings.

How would an i ncrease in the costs of debt and equity get reflected in Minnesota 15 \nPower’s rates?  16 \nA. For practical reasons I address in greater detail below, this is a much larger concern for 17 \nMinnesota Power’s cost of debt than it is for the Company’s cost of equity , so I address 18 \nthe cost of debt first. 19 \n \n90 Inquiry into the Potential Effects of Financial Difficulties at NRG and Xcel Energy, Inc. on Northern States Power \nCompany and its Customers  and Potential Mitigation Measures,  MPUC Docket No. E,G002/CI -02-1346, COMMENTS \nOF THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE  at 1 (Sept. 4, 2002).  \n91 Ex DOC -__, CMA -D-16 (Addonizio Direct).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 72   I n rate cases, the cost of debt  used to set a utility’s rates  is usually set equal to 1 \nthe weighted average actual interest rate on Minnesota Power’s outstanding debt. I n 2 \nfuture rate cases, ALLETE’s or Minnesota Power’s actual weighted average cost of debt 3 \nwill be the starting point for determining the cost of debt that gets reflect in Minnesota 4 \nPower’s rates. While the Commission would have the authority to approve a different 5 \ncost of debt for rate -making purposes, estimating a reasonable alternative cost of debt 6 \ncould be difficult. Therefore, ALLETE’s actual cost of debt will likely be a strong anchor 7 \nand heavily influence the final cost of debt included in rates.  8 \n 9 \nQ. If Minnesota Power’s cost of debt were to rise post- A cquisition, would it be easy to 10 \ndetermine the cause of the increase?  11 \nA. It depends. If ,  for example, a credit ratings agency lowers ALLETE’s credit rating and 12 \ncites the Acquisition, or influence from Alloy, as a main cause, then yes, it would be easy 13 \nto conclude that the Acquisition caused an increase in ALLETE or Minnesota Power’s 14 \ncost of debt. However, investors may demand higher interest rates on Minnesota 15 \nPower’s debt even absent a downgrade, and the incremental cost  would be very difficult 16 \nto discern.   17 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 73 Q. If  in a future rate case the Commission were to conclude that Minnesota Power’s cost 1 \nof debt were unreasonably high as a result of effects of the Acquisition, would it be 2 \neasy to calculate an adjustment to Minnesota Power’s cost of debt to remove those 3 \neffects? 4 \nA. It would be possible, but it might not be simple. In calculating Minnesota Power’s 5 \nweighted average cost of debt, the interest rate on any piece of debt the Commission 6 \ndetermines is unreasonably high could be replaced with a representative interest rate 7 \nbased on debt issuances from around the same time but from utilities with higher debt 8 \nratings. The Department does not currently have access to data that would easily allow 9 \nit to conduct that type of analysis.  10 \n 11 \nQ. Could Minnesota Power’s cost of equity also increase as a result of the Acquisition?  12 \nA. Theoretically, yes. However, for practical reasons related to how the cost of equity is 13 \nestimated, an increase in the cost of equity is less of a concern with respect to future 14 \nrate proceedings.  15 \n 16 \nQ. What are those practical reasons?  17 \nA. As described above, a utility’s  c ost of debt is usually calculated as the weighted average 18 \ninterest rate on its outstanding debt.  When a utility issues debt, the interest rate on the 19 \ndebt is determined by investors, directly observable, and readily available. While some 20 \nmay argue that the interest rate on a debt issuance is unreasonably high, there is little 21 \nto no room to argue that cost of the debt is something other than the  actual interest 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 74 rate.  I f Minnesota Power’s cost of debt were to rise as a result of the Acquisition, it will 1 \nautomatically be reflected in the Company’s rates unless an explicit adjustment is made.  2 \n  Th e is no directly observable measure  of the cost of equity comparable to the 3 \ninterest rate on a debt issuance . Instead , the cost of equity must be estimated with 4 \nfinancial models applied to proxy groups of other utilities thought to be of comparable 5 \nrisk. A modeler has a greater degree of control over the inputs to a cost of equity 6 \nanalysis than he or she would with a cost of debt analysis, which typically begins with 7 \nthe utility’s actual cost of debt.  Thus, while the Company’s “real- world” cost of equity 8 \n(i.e., the return investors would require in order to be willing to make an equity 9 \ninvestment), the authorized return on equity that gets reflected in Minnesota Power’s 10 \nrates will only rise as a result of the Acquisition if the return on equity witnesses model 11 \nit differently. I generally agree with Ms. Bulkley that it would be unreasonable to do so 12 \nas that would amount to rewarding the new shareholders for an unnecessary decision 13 \nto raise the Company’s costs.  14 \n 15 \nIV. OTHER ISSUES  16 \nQ. Are there any additional issues you would like to address?  17 \nA. Yes. The Commission’s October 7, 2024 Order referring this matter to the OAH included 18 \na request for record development of several issues.  I would like to briefly address  two 19 \nof them :  20 \n• How do relevant and related dockets pending before the Federal Energy 21 \nRegulatory Commission, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and/or other state, 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 75 federal or foreign government agencies impact the Commission’s consideration of the 1 \nproposed  transaction?  2 \n• How will the acquisition impact Minnesota Power's ability to comply with 3 \nthe carbon- free standard under Minn.

Are you aware of any other proceedings related to this transaction that are relevant to 8 \nthe Commission’s consideration of the proposed transaction?  9 \nA. Yes. The proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is 10 \nrelevant.  11 \n  I un derstand that in order to approve a transaction like the proposed 12 \nAcquisition, FERC is required to find that it “will not result in cross -subsidization of a 13 \nnon-utility associate company or the pledge or encumbrance of utility assets for the 14 \nbenefit of an associate company, unless the Commission determines that the cross - 15 \nsubsidization, pledge, or encumbrance will be consistent with the public interest.”93 16 \n  In  their Application to FERC, the Petitioners stated that the Acquisition falls 17 \nwithin a “safe harbor” for transactions subject to review and approval by a state 18 \ncommission, specifically review and approval by the Minnesota and Wisconsin 19 \n \n92 ORDER REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND GRANTING INTERVENTION , AND NOTICE OF AND ORDER FOR HEARING  at 12 \n(Oct. 7, 2024).  \n93 ORDER AUTHORIZING DISPOSITION OF JURISDICTIONAL FACILITIES AND ACQUISITION OF SECURITIES : 189 FERC ¶ 61,215 at 14 \n(2024) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 76 Commissions.  The Petitioners stated that bo th state commissions have the authority to 1 \nprotect captive customers against inappropriate cross -subsidization for the benefit of 2 \nunregulated affiliates. In other words, the Petitioners stated that FERC did not need to 3 \nconsider cross -subsidization issues in rendering its decision on the Acquisition because it 4 \ncould rely on  the Commission and PSCW  to protect ALLETE’s captive ratepayers from 5 \nrelated harms.  6 \n  FE RC agreed with the Petitioners, but, consistent with established FERC Policy, 7 \nrequired the Petitioners to submit an informational filing within 10 days of the 8 \nCommission’s and PSCW’s action on the Acquisition. Thus, the Commission’s 9 \ndeterminations regarding affiliate interest issues in this proceeding will play an 10 \nimportant role in FERC’s ultimate decision on the Acquisition.  11 \n  Ms.  Vavro discusses concerns related to the Petitioners’ plan to comply with 12 \nMinn. Stat. § 216B.48 (2024), which governs utilities’ relationships with affiliates.  13 \n 14 \nQ. How will the Acquisition i mpact the Company 's ability to comply with Minnesota’s 15 \ncarbon -free standard ? 16 \nA. It is not possible to predict with any specificity how the Acquisition will impact the 17 \nCompany’s ability to comply. The Partners’ desire and ability to invest capital in the 18 \nCompany will likely be one of the largest, if not the largest, determining factors. I 19 \ndiscussed my related concerns above.  In addition, it is possible that both GIP and CPP 20 \nInvestments will sell Alloy and ALLETE prior to 2040, perhaps by several years. In that 21 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 77 case, the willingness and ability by the new owner or owners will play in important role, 1 \nas well.  2 \n 3 \nV. CONCLUSION  4 \nQ. Please summarize your conclusions.  5 \nA. Based on the analysis described above, I conclude that:  6 \n• The Acquisition is unlikely to provide Minnesota Power with meaningfully improved 7 \naccess to capital, and there is at least some potential that the Acquisition will worsen 8 \nthe Company’s access to capital.   9 \n• Access to the P artners’ expertise resulting from the Acquisition is unlikely to provide 10 \nany meaningful benefits to Minnesota Power’s ratepayers or the public interest 11 \ngenerally.  12 \n• If the Partners employ financial engineering strategies to increase the returns they 13 \nearn from their investments in Alloy, the extra debt may cause Minnesota Power’s 14 \ncost of capital to rise, which would result in rates that are higher than they otherwise 15 \nwould have been absent the Acquisition.  16 \n• Ultimately, the Acquisition should not be expected to provide any meaningful benefits 17 \nto ratepayers or the public interest, and poses several significant risks, as discussed 18 \nabove and by Ms. Vavro. Therefore, the Acquisition does not pass the Commission’s 19 \nbalancing test, as the potential detriments outweigh the potential benefits.   20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Direct / 78 Q.

This d ocum\nent was prepared by GIP for its investment committee in May 2024 and \nwas pres\nented to the investment committee of GIP Fund V as part of its final decision to make an investment in \nALLETE. T\nhe materials prepared for GIP’s investment committee are custom\nary for\n any ini\ntial investment that GIP \nis con\nsidering making thro ug\nh its funds and inc\nlude valuati\non inf\normation and hig\nhlight risks,  ch\nallenges and \nopp\nortunities relat ed to\n a particular investment, inc\nluding a ran ge of pote\nntial out\ncomes, which  are based on \nassu mp\ntions the deal team professionals deem appropriate for\n a par ticular\n transaction. However, these materials \nrepr esen\nt and are based on projections, ranges of understanding, and scenario planning by GIP based on the \ninform\nation available at the time, in many cases predating the undertaking or completion of due di ligence. \nAs \nsuch , th\ne pro\njections are not\n certain, inc\nlude out\nlier scen\narios, and are not\n necess\narily scenarios that GIP\n expe\ncts to \nhap\npen.

If not, explain your answer and provide all documents that support your answer.  \nb. Please explain specifically what the Company means by “more reliably” in this context.  \nc. Please identify and fully describe specific instances in the past when the Company was unable to raise \nneeded equity capital from the public market due to a lack of “ reliability ,” and how the Company’s \nratepayers and other stakeholders were negatively impacted.  \nResponse:  \n \na. Minnesota Power believes the rate of return in the pending rate case is reasonable based on the  agreement \nby all parties to the settlement agreement in that case. However, it does not change the nature of the public markets, the Company’s size relative to the industry, ALLETE’s unique risk based on its industrial exposure, nor the nature of the Company’s capital needs.   \n \nb.  The reference to “more reliably” is in contrast to the volatility of the stock market that could make the \ncost of capital high during a down economic cycle and low stock price.

That upfront alignment \nincludes an understanding of the Company’s capital needs which will result in more reliable financing than \nwhat would be available in the public market, where investors can change from quarter to quarter.  The reference to “more reliably” in the context of access to capital is intended to refer to the general expectation that, post -Acquisition, when capital is needed, ALLETE will be able to work with the Pa rtners \nand will be less exposed to the whims of public investors.  \n \nc.   Our use of the phrase “more reliably” in the Petition was not intended to suggest that ALLETE has been \nunable to obtain needed capital in the past.  We anticipate, however, that ALLETE will face unprecedented \ncapital expenditure needs as it moves forward with plans consistent with Minnesota state policy and \nMinnesota Power’s integrated resource plans.

This places ALLETE  in a unique position where \nits reliance on equity financing through secondary offerings  (i.e., issuing additional stock) can have a \nsignificant effect on the Company’s financial  outlook.  First , relying on public capital markets exposes\nALLETE to the volatility of  the stock market. Over  the last two years, the AL LETE stock price has traded \nbelow $48/share and above $67/share , representing a 40  percent  variation over this period  (and\nALLETE’s stock trades at a discount to its peers because of several unique  characteristics of the\nCompany discussed in the responses to DOC  IR 0014, 0015, and 0018). As  discussed in our response to \npart (b), below, having to issue stock through a secondary offering when our stock price is low has a\nmaterial effect on the Company’s financial  outlook, which means the Company has less flexibil ity in\nterms of timing of and access  to capital.

As noted in the Petition, the Partners have an ability to exercise more patience \nwith respect to quarterly earnings and dividends due to their longer -term focus. In this context, (1)  \nbeing able to raise equity as needed through the Partners versus taking what equity financing can be \navailable in the public markets through  large secondary offerings that take an enormous amount of \ntime and resources ; and (2) the Partners’  statement around being able  to exercise patience around \nshort -term earnings and dividends are examples of   how the proposed Acquisition will provide ALLETE  \naccess to  “flexible” capital that can more readily meet ALLETE’s long -term and short -term needs \nwithout the quarter -by-quarter, year -by-year demands of public markets. To be clear, ALLETE will not \nlose access to the large institutional investors active in public markets, but will ins tead add to  the \nexisting base of available investors through the Partners’ relationships with banking institutions and other investors and i mprove ALLETE’s flexibility in accessing capital.  \n \nb. Issuing equity while  the stock price is low increases the dilution impacts and raises the cost of capital. \nALLETE has managed this well in the past , but, due to the capital requirements going forward , the \nCompany  would not have the ability to manage the timing of issuances without materially impacting \nthe timing and efficiency around the execution of the strategy.  Specifically, due to the substantially \nlarger annual requirements for additional equity that the Company will face going forward, the \nCompany’s prior success in timing its  secondary issuances does not indicate that the Company will have \nthe same success  going forward. Rather, the Company is far more likely to require substantial external  \nequity during tim es of severe equity market conditions , resulting in a higher cost of capital.  Having the \ncapital available  from the Partners will significantly mitigate these timing  issues that can materially  \nimpact the Company.  \nDocket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx.

As explained by Witnesses Bram and Alley, the Partners \nare large, well -known, well -financed investment managers and the transaction is structured in s uch \nas a way as to insulate the Alloy entities from any financial impacts outside of ALLETE and \nMinnesota Power.  See also the response to CUB IR 0142.  \nNo. If the question refers to the financial distress of any of the Alloy entities, the proposed organizational structure makes them sufficiently remote from ALLETE and the utility that ALLETE \n(and by extension Minnesota Power) would retain access to short -term and long -term debt and the \nability to issue preferred shares if additional equity is needed.  \nDocket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx.

CPP Investments’ capital comes from the funds not immediately \nneeded by the Canada Pension Plan (“CPP”) to pay benefits to the CPP’s beneficiaries, which is received and \nmanaged by CPP Investments.  Such funds are allocated based on CPP Investments’ long -term investment goals, \nwhile ensuring that CPP Investments makes consistent investment decisions to mitigate risk.   \n(1) Once fund raising for GIP Fund V closes, we do not expect any  new investors or capital will be sought for GIP \nFund V.  GIP Fund V has a target of $25 billion, the majority of which has already been raised as of the date of this \nresponse and is sufficient to support the current and future investments in ALLETE.  Tower Bridge also has adequate \ncapital for the acquisition. Once the fund raising for GIP Fund V closes, the fund will have a five -year investment \nperiod where it will consider making new investments, but in all cases Tower Bridge and GIP Fund V will retai n \ncapital to invest in and support their existing investments, including ALLETE, for the life of the fund.  Accordingly, \nneither fund anticipates needing to seek new capital in connection with the ALLETE acquisition outside of each \nPartner’s respective fund commitments.  \n(2) The GIP investment in ALLETE is a GIP Fund V investment, and no other GIP funds or investors outside of GIP Fund V and the investors in that fund will provide capital to ALLETE (except for the Tower Bridge fund and its investor, CalPERS, which is also an investor in ALLETE).  \n(3) Yes, we expect the initial split of Alloy’s ownership (40% GIP Fund V, 20% Tower Bridge, and 40% CPP \nInvestments) to be maintained as new capital is allocated to Alloy and ultimately ALLETE.  \n(4)-(5) See responses to bullets (1) and (2), above, confirming we do not anticipate introducing new investors once \nGIP Fund V closes.  Accordingly, there will not be a need to balance interests of new investors or price new \ninvestment interests.  \n \nDocket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx.

The following response is provided within that context:  \n \n(a) Parent has received commitments for a $600 million term loan, only $300 million of which is expected to be drawn at close in connection with the acquisition, with the balance available to fund future capital projects of ALLETE, Inc. and its subsidiaries af ter the acquisition closes. Parent also has received a commitment for a $100 million revolving \ncredit facility for use after the acquisition closes to assist in supporting future capital needs of ALLETE, Inc. and it s subsidiaries. The term loan and revolve r will be non -recourse with respect to ALLETE, Inc., its subsidiaries and their \nassets, as ALLETE, Inc. and its subsidiaries will not be obligors under such facilities. Additionally, ALLETE has a corporate revolving credit facility with banks, multiple bilateral credit or letter of credit facilities and various series \nof mortgage bonds and private placement notes.  \n \n(b) Ongoing draws on funding committed to GIP V by its limited partner investors will remain available.  Please note that the five -year investment window relates to the decision to invest in new ventures and does not limit the \nprovision of capital that has bee n committed prior to the five -year period ends. With respect to additional capit al \nfor ALLETE, please see the responses to DOC IR 0007 and 0009.  \n \nOnce fund raising for GIP Fund V closes, new  investors or capital for GIP Fund V are not anticipated. GIP Fund V has \na target of $25 billion, the majority of which has already been raised as of the date of this response and is sufficient \nto support the current and future investments in ALLETE. Tower  Bridge also has adequate capital for the acquisition. \nOnce the fund raising for GIP Fund V closes, the fund will have a five -year investment period where it will consider \nmaking new investments, but in all cases  Tower Bridge and GIP Fund V will retain capital to invest in and support \ntheir existing investments, including ALLETE, for the life of the fund.

(b) Provide \nall evidence to support your yes -or-no answer.  (c) Does ALLETE actually have an independent basis \nfor this statement, or did you just copy it from something that CPP Investments said?  \nResponse:  \nIt is Minnesota Power's typical practice to avoid stating formal legal objections and/or standing on those \nobjections to discovery in Minnesota regulatory proceedings, to the extent practicable, to facilitate a \ncooperative and productive process. However, many of the questions and stated premises, as well as the \nargumentative tone, in this set of information requests from CUB’s external witness (CUB IRs 1 -72) are \noutside typical discovery practices in the Minnesota regulatory process, and therefore necessar ily affect the \nCompany's and Partners' responses.  \nIn a\nddition, consistent with Minnesota practice, the party(ies) and witness(es) responding to this discovery \nrequest are denoted by the witness information in the footer of this response.  \n(a) and (b) Minnesota Power and the Partners cannot speculate as to counterfactual or hypotheticalscenarios regarding whether Puget Sound Energy’s efforts would have failed absent CPP Investments’ involvement.\nDocket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx.

INTRODUCTION  1 \nQ. Please state your name, occupation and business address. 2 \nA. My name is Stephanie Vavro. I am the Principal of Silverpoint Consulting LLC 3 \n(“Silverpoint”). My business address is 1519 Whispering Woods Circle, Allentown, 4 \nPennsylvania 18106. 5 \n 6 \nQ. What is your educational and professional background, and what is your experience in 7 \nregulatory matters? 8 \nA. Since forming Silverpoint in 2009, I have managed projects on behalf of state regulatory 9 \ncommissions in areas such as utility management and operations; mergers; affiliate 10 \nrelationship, transaction, and cost allocation audits; electric distribution system 11 \nreliability and resilience; and storm preparedness and response. Before that time, I was 12 \na senior consultant with The Liberty Consulting Group for nearly ten years where I 13 \nworked on similar engagements. I have a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and a 14 \nmaster’s degree in management science, both from Lehigh University. A summary of my 15 \neducation, professional background, and experience in regulatory matters is presented 16 \nin Ex. DOC-__, SLV-D-1 (Vavro Direct).   17 \n 18 \nII. PURPOSE AND SCOPE  19 \nQ. What is the purpose of your testimony? 20 \nA. On July 19, 2024, ALLETE, Inc., d/b/a Minnesota Power (“ALLETE” or “Company”) 21 \nsubmitted a Petition to the Minnesota Public Utility Commission (“Commission”) for an 22 \norder approving the acquisition of ALLETE by entities under the control or management 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 2 of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP Investments”) and/or Global 1 \nInfrastructure Partners (“GIP”) (together, the “Partners”). Silverpoint was engaged by 2 \nthe Minnesota Department of Commerce, Division of Energy Resources (“Department”) 3 \nto assist in its evaluation of the Company’s Petition. I am providing testimony on the 4 \nDepartment’s overall assessment of the proposed transaction. Testimony also is being 5 \nsubmitted on behalf of the Department by Craig Addonizio concerning the principal 6 \npurported benefit of the transaction, namely better access to financing. Mr. Addonizio 7 \nalso provides a summary of the Department’s analysis to date.  8 \n 9 \nQ. Please explain how your testimony is organized.   10 \nA. Section III of my testimony contains a summary of the Department’s conclusions 11 \nregarding aspects of the proposed transaction. In Section IV, I provide a brief overview 12 \nof the parties to the proposed transaction and the post-acquisition ownership structure. 13 \nIn Section V, I discuss our evaluation of the purported benefits and potential risks of the 14 \nproposed transaction. Section VI contains a brief recap of my testimony. 15 \n 16 \nIII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS  17 \nQ. Please summarize the Department’s conclusions regarding the proposed merger.   18 \nA. I understand that Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 conditions the Commission’s approval of a 19 \nmerger on an affirmative finding that the proposed transaction is consistent with the 20 \npublic interest, i.e., only if perceived detriments do not outweigh proposed benefits.  21 \nThe Department has serious concerns regarding the acquisition as proposed by ALLETE 22 \nand the Partners (collectively, “the Parties”). It offers few, if any, positive benefits to 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 3 ratepayers while posing serious risks that would adversely impact them.  These risks 1 \nsignificantly outweigh any benefits, and the acquisition is therefore inconsistent with 2 \nthe public interest. The Department recommends that the Commission reject the 3 \nproposed merger. 4 \n 5 \n Q. What are the Department’s specific concerns regarding the transaction?   6 \nA. While we have identified numerous risks to the public interest, our principal concerns 7 \nare as follows:  8 \n The Partners demonstrate insufficient regard for the regulatory compact.  The 9 \nCommission has a mandate to oversee and regulate Minnesota Power for the 10 \nbenefit and protection of its ratepayers, which requires cooperation and 11 \nopenness by the utility.  The Partners fail to recognize that acquiring a regulated 12 \nutility brings with it the obligation to cooperate with its regulators.  13 \n The Petitioners have not adequately addressed transparency and self-dealing 14 \nconcerns to the detriment of ratepayers.  Particularly concerning is the Parties’ 15 \nnarrow view of Minnesota’s affiliated interest standard that ensures arms-length 16 \ncontracts between affiliates and the utility, and protects ratepayers from the 17 \nfinancial harms that result from conflicts of interest. Should the transaction 18 \nmove forward, Minnesota Power would have hundreds, if not thousands, of new 19 \naffiliates, magnifying the potential risk that above-market costs could be passed 20 \non to ratepayers. In a similar vein, the Commission requires sufficient access to 21 \nbooks and records to ensure that customer rates are just and reasonable. The 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 4 Parties’ heavily caveated commitments to transparency1 fail to recognize the 1 \nimport of the Commission’s oversight responsibility.  2 \n Proposed governance structures fail to reflect the regulatory compact, which 3 \nbalances the needs of the public with the needs of the utility.  The proposed 4 \ngovernance structure is not well-defined and fails to reflect that the principal 5 \nbusiness of ALLETE is the provision of regulated utility service. As a publicly 6 \ntraded company, ALLETE’s focus is largely directed to the activities of its two 7 \nregulated utilities. If the proposed merger is approved, ALLETE and its utilities 8 \nwill be owned by private equity funds with extensive holdings, a much broader 9 \nscope, and uncertain priorities. The Partners will appoint every director on 10 \nALLETE’s Board and control all the entities above it, which will lead to an 11 \noutsized influence on Minnesota Power’s senior executive decision-making. 12 \n Minnesota Power remains exposed to the financial risks of ALLETE’s non- 13 \nregulated businesses . Regulatory commitments regarding separateness fail to 14 \naddress the existing lack of adequate ring-fencing protection for Minnesota 15 \nPower. The new owners could invest billions of dollars in ALLETE’s non-regulated 16 \nenterprises, further magnifying the utility’s risk to potential financial distress or 17 \nbankruptcy. The lack of adequate financial protection may also depress the 18 \nutility’s credit ratings and lead to higher cost of debt. 19 \n Many regulatory commitments are merely aspirational or at best a temporary 20 \nreprieve from potential harms.  The statement that Minnesota Power will use 21 \n \n1 Ex. MP-___ at 20-23 (Petition). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 5 “commercially reasonable” efforts to maintain its debt/equity ratios and its 1 \ncorporate and facility ratings in accordance with regulatory requirements is not a 2 \ncommitment—it is an aspiration.2 As such it is a weak protection against future 3 \nharm to ratepayers in terms of increases to the utility’s cost of capital. Short- 4 \nterm protections such as those offered for employees, local management, the 5 \nlocal community, and low-income customers are at best a temporary stopgap 6 \nagainst future harms and must not be construed as benefits.3 7 \n The likelihood of a near-term rate increase is unclear .  The purported benefit of 8 \nbetter access to financing is unlikely to yield any real reduction in Minnesota 9 \nPower’s cost of capital.  Overall, there is considerable uncertainty around the 10 \nimpact of the proposed transaction on rates, which the Partners have done little 11 \nto mitigate.4 These risks are discussed in more detail in the testimony of Craig 12 \nAddonizio. 13 \n  14 \n I discuss these and other concerns in more depth in Section V of my testimony. 15 \n 16 \nIV. OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION  17 \nQ. Please provide a brief description of the principals in this transaction. 18 \nA.

What about the benefit of better access to expertise? 1 \nA. Clearly the Partners have garnered experience from their investments in a wide variety2 \nof companies and industries. CPP Investments, for example, has offered to share its 3 \nexpertise in such areas as real estate, infrastructure, and energy, while GIP has offered 4 \nto share expertise in areas such as procurement, debt financing, and capex 5 \nmanagement.  Jonathan Bram testified that support from the Partners will help unlock 6 \nvalue for customers, and this support will be provided through the appointment of 7 \nexperienced, professional board members who will cooperate with other board 8 \nmembers and the company’s management.

Regardless, any benefit to Minnesota Power is not meaningful enough to 1 \noffset the considerable downside risks of the transaction.  2 \n 3 \n The testimony of Craig Addonizio further discusses this purported benefit.  4 \n 5 \nQ. What is the Department’s overall conclusion about the purported benefits of the 6 \ntransaction?   7 \nA. The benefits are highly speculative, and the Parties have failed to demonstrate that the 8 \nmagnitude of any potential benefits is significant. Such minimal, speculative benefits do 9 \nnot offset what are unacceptable levels of risk.  10 \n 11 \nB. ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS  12 \nQ. What are the risks of the proposed transaction? 13 \nA. There are many. I will first discuss the risks of this transaction that fall into three main 14 \ncategories: regulatory compliance, corporate separateness, and governance. In Section 15 \nIII of my testimony, I summarized certain risks of this transaction that are integrally 16 \nrelated to the concept of the regulatory compact. That concept will be a common 17 \nthread in my comments about the risks in each of these three categories. 18 \n 19 \nQ. Please describe the concept of the regulatory compact.   20 \nA. The relationship between regulators and utilities is often described as the regulatory 21 \ncompact. It is a bedrock principal of public utility regulation, the exact details of which 22 \nare normally determined by the history of statutes, codes, and regulatory decisions in 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \nVav\nro Direct / 10 each given state. In return for regulators granting exclusive service territories and 1 \nsetting rates that provide an opportunity for a fair and reasonable return on investment, 2 \nutilities submit their operations to full regulation. Regulators, on behalf of customers, 3 \nagree to pay back up-front investments with a reasonable return but also get to limit 4 \nprofits and exercise some direction on utility decisions. The regulatory compact in effect 5 \ninduces capital being directed by investors into long-lived utility assets, since the utility 6 \nreceives the assurance that prudent long-term capital investments will be returned. 7 \nThe Partners and their investors are clearly quite familiar with one side of the 8 \nregulatory compact, which is that once approved, the utility is essentially guaranteed an 9 \nopportunity to fully recover and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. In a 10 \nGIP presentation to its potential investors, for example,  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE 11 \nSECRET NOT FOR GIP/ALLETE DATA BEGINS. . .  12 \n13 \n14 \n . . . HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 15 \nTRADE SECRET NOT FOR GIP/ALLETE DATA ENDS] .16 The Partners do not, however, 16 \nadequately acknowledge the responsibilities associated with the other side of the 17 \nbargain—regulatory compliance, transparency, and ratepayer protection. 18 \n16 Ex. DOC-__, CMA-D-5 at 40 (Addonizio Direct) (DOC IR 0060.01 Attach SUPP HCTS). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n\n \n \nVavro Direct / 11 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 1 \nQ. Are there significant potential risks of the proposed transaction related to regulatory 2 \ncompliance? 3 \nA. Yes. The Parties imply that Minnesota Power’s obligation to comply with the 4 \nCommission’s rules and regulations should be somehow different when they own the 5 \nutility.  I will focus on two of these obligations in my comments—compliance with the 6 \nCommission’s affiliated interest standards and the utility’s obligation to provide a level 7 \nof transparency consistent with the Commission’s regulatory mandate.  8 \n 9 \nQ. What are the Commission’s affiliated interest standards? 10 \nA. I understand that Minn. Stat. § 216B.48 defines an affiliated interest with a public utility 11 \nto mean every corporation and person owning or holding directly or indirectly five 12 \npercent or more of the voting securities of such public utility. Under the statute, any 13 \ncontract greater than $50,000 between a public utility and one of its affiliated interests 14 \nrequires the written approval of the Commission. Companies also must file a list of their 15 \naffiliated interests annually. 16 \n   17 \nQ. What is the purpose of these standards? 18 \nA. Affiliated interest standards are designed to regulate and monitor business relationships 19 \nbetween a public utility company and other entities closely connected to it. These 20 \nstandards are meant to ensure sufficient transparency around contracts between 21 \naffiliated entities to prevent potential conflicts of interest. Without such protections, 22 \nself-dealing could lead to inflated prices for goods or services or discretionary purchases 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 12 that are not truly needed, e.g., consulting services.  Minnesota regulations are not 1 \nunique in this regard. Many states such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Texas 2 \nhave statutes with very similar language, using the same threshold of five percent for 3 \ndefining affiliated interest. Other state commissions such as Maine and Virgina have 4 \nstatutes that are similarly constructed but have adopted a higher threshold of ten 5 \npercent.  What these statutes all have in common, however, is that they provide a 6 \nframework for the review of procurements involving affiliates to prevent favoritism 7 \nand/or cross-subsidization at ratepayer expense. 8 \n 9 \nQ. How do these standards apply to the Partners?  10 \nA. After closing, Alloy Parent, holding 100 percent of ALLETE’s voting securities, will quite 11 \nclearly be an affiliated interest of Minnesota Power. As the owners of Alloy Parent, CPP 12 \nInvestments and GIP (now owned by BlackRock) will own 40 percent and 60 percent of 13 \nALLETE, respectively—clearly well above the statute’s five percent threshold. As such, 14 \nany agreements between Minnesota Power and affiliates of GIP, BlackRock, or CPP 15 \nInvestments would require approval by the Commission.  Minnesota Power also will be 16 \nrequired to file an annual report that identifies the full list of affiliated interests.  17 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 13 Q. What have the Partners proposed in the way of future compliance with the affiliated 1 \ninterest standard? 2 \nA. They urge other parties to this proceeding to adopt a “reasonable and flexible 3 \napproach” to this standard.17 Under their approach, the only affiliated interests the 4 \nPartners are willing to track and report on will be “entities directly up the chain” of 5 \nALLETE corporate ownership. More specifically, they propose that the applicability of 6 \nMinn. Stat. § 216B.48 be limited to future ALLETE and to intermediary holding 7 \ncompanies of CPP Investments and GIP directly above ALLETE,18 companies that are 8 \nunlikely to provide any product or service but that would likely take part in a future tax 9 \nsharing agreement. 10 \n  The Parties’ position on this matter is oddly out of step with other recent take-11 \nprivate transactions. In the recent El Paso Electric proceeding in Texas, for example, 12 \nInfrastructure Investment Fund (IIF) made firm commitments to comply with affiliated 13 \ninterest statutes, rules, and regulations. In the Merger Agreement filed with the original 14 \nPetition, the parties stated that “for the avoidance of doubt, the Sponsor [IIF] and any 15 \ndirect or indirect portfolio companies owned, managed or controlled by the Sponsor 16 \nshall be considered an Affiliate of Parent and Merger Sub.”19  17 \n \n17 Ex.

Regulatory commitments in Exhibit C of the \nMerger Agreement include: “Each of EPE and Sun Jupiter [parent] will maintain an arm’s-length relationship with \none another and with IIF US 2 and its affiliates, consistent with the Commission and NMPRC affiliate standards as \napplicable to EPE.” \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 14 Q. What is the Department’s reaction to the Parties’ position?  1 \nA. Any suggestion that future contracts between Minnesota Power and any of the 2 \nmultitudes of CPP Investments, GIP, and BlackRock affiliates should be immune from 3 \nCommission review is very troubling. Their suggestion trivializes the importance of the 4 \nCommission’s oversight role in protecting ratepayers against conflicts of interest and 5 \nignores the basic tenets of the regulatory compact.  Any scenario in which future 6 \ncontracts between Minnesota Power and any one of many hundreds of Partner 7 \ncompanies are not subjected to Commission approval is clearly inconsistent with the 8 \npublic interest. The Partners should not have an opportunity to extract extra value 9 \nthrough preferential treatment in utility procurements. 10 \n   11 \nQ. Do you expect there to be a significant number of contracts in the future with 12 \nBlackRock, GIP and CPP Investments affiliates?  13 \nA. We have no way of knowing, however given the breadth of the holdings of GIP, CPP 14 \nInvestments, and BlackRock, it is hard to imagine there would never be any affiliated 15 \ninterest contracts.  The Partners have spoken of their expertise and relationships across 16 \na broad range of industry, financial, and business matters. It is unclear whether this 17 \n“access to expertise” or to some of their business relationships might be provided to the 18 \nALLETE Board or Minnesota Power under favorable consulting contracts that are 19 \nultimately paid for by ratepayers.  We have seen some evidence that it will. In a 20 \npresentation to an investor committee, CPP Investments mentions [HIGHLY 21 \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET NOT FOR GIP/ALLETE DATA BEGINS . . .  22 \n 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n\n1 \n. 20 2 \n21.. .

This reference hints at the likelihood 4 \nof meaningful affiliate transactions. 5 \nGIP intends to provide Minnesota Power support and expertise in many ways 6 \nincluding through its CEO Council which consists of certain platform companies in the 7 \nutility subsector who apparently will share best practices, including expertise, 8 \nrelationships, operations and maintenance practices, and purchasing power.  The 9 \nCouncil consist of CEOs of companies like Vena Energy, Clearway Energy, Eolian, Skyborn 10 \nRenewables and Atlas Renewable along with two GIP investment partners. 22 HIGHLY 11 \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS . . . 12 \n . . . 13 \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS] .23 Given the size and scale of the 14 \nPartners and BlackRock, and their involvement in an extremely wide range of industries 15 \nand companies, there is clearly a high potential for conflicts of interest—this is hardly 16 \ndebatable. 17 \n20 Ex.

The potential for conflicts of interest between 2 \nMinnesota Power and the network of Partner affiliates is substantial. The Partners’ end 3 \nof the regulatory compact requires submitting to regulatory review the costs that are 4 \nultimately borne by ratepayers. Doing so will require them to provide an appropriate 5 \nlevel of transparency to substantiate compliance with not only Minn. Stat. § 216B.48 but 6 \nany other applicable statutes and rules.  7 \n 8 \nQ. How does the issue of transparency relate to the regulatory compact? 9 \nA. Under the regulatory compact, utilities are required to provide safe and reliable service 10 \nto ratepayers, and in return, they are entitled to recover the costs to provide that 11 \nservice, plus an opportunity to earn a reasonable return. The overall mission of the 12 \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission is to create and maintain a regulatory 13 \nenvironment that ensures not only safe, reliable, and efficient utility services but also 14 \nfair and reasonable rates. As such, one of the Commission’s primary tasks is to 15 \ndetermine what constitutes a reasonable cost of service. Doing so requires the right to 16 \naudit and proper access to books, records, and information from the utility and its 17 \nparent. It also extends to affiliated companies to the extent their contracts are reflected 18 \nin utility costs. 19 \n 20 \nQ. Have the Parties made any regulatory commitments related to transparency?   21 \nA. The Parties have stated that they are committed to continue providing access to 22 \nMinnesota Power’s books, records, and information, to continue making required 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 17 annual filings with the Commission, and to provide information required by Commission 1 \norders such as credit rating agency reports.24 With their Petition, they included 2 \nAttachment H, which was intended to map the information about ALLETE that is now 3 \npublicly available to the equivalent source once they are a privately owned company. 4 \nOverall, their commitments do not indicate much transparency beyond the ALLETE level.  5 \nTo the extent the Parties have made any commitments to information at the Alloy 6 \nParent level and above they are generally heavily conditioned. Overall, they appear 7 \nunwilling to replicate the level of transparency that is currently provided by ALLETE to 8 \nthe Commission consistent with its oversight and decision-making authority over the 9 \nstate’s utilities.    10 \n  11 \nQ. Are these commitments sufficient?  12 \nA. No. One of the primary differences between a utility that is part of a publicly traded 13 \ncompany and one owned by private investors is transparency.  Given the complexity of 14 \nthe organizational structure and nature of the private entities involved, obtaining clear 15 \ncommitments for access to all relevant entities up through the Partner level is critical. 16 \nTransparency as it pertains to this transaction goes beyond rate-making and affiliated 17 \ninterest agreements, it extends to compliance with potential merger conditions as well.  18 \n The Parties have not provided transparency commitments sufficiently sweeping and 19 \nbroad to ensure access to any and all books, records, data, and information from 20 \nwhichever entities are appropriate and relevant to three broad categories: (a) 21 \n \n24 Ex. MP-___ at 20-23 (Petition). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 18 ratemaking and similar regulatory proceedings, (b) compliance with Minnesota rules, 1 \nregulations, and statutes including affiliated interests, and (c) compliance with any and 2 \nall regulatory commitments and conditions that would be included in a merger approval 3 \norder by this Commission.  Only such broad-based commitments to transparency would 4 \nbe consistent with the regulatory compact.  5 \n 6 \nCORPORATE SEPARATENESS 7 \nQ. What is corporate separateness?  8 \nA. Ring-fencing is sometimes referred to as corporate separateness and is intended to 9 \ncreate a virtual barrier that segregates a portion of a company’s financial assets from 10 \nthe rest. Ring-fencing measures are intended to insulate a regulated utility from the 11 \npotentially riskier activities of an unregulated affiliate. A key component of the 12 \nregulator’s side of the regulatory compact is ratepayer protections. Protecting the 13 \nregulated utility from the threat of financial distress or bankruptcy is certainly part of 14 \nthat obligation. It also prevents the utility from being penalized with lower credit ratings 15 \nbecause of its exposure risk, which can lead to higher debt costs reflected in rates.  16 \n 17 \nQ. What type of ring-fencing commitments have the Parties made to address the 18 \npotential business and financial risks associated with this transaction? 19 \nA. The Parties have made several corporate separateness commitments.25 These are 20 \nintended to generally hold ALLETE harmless from any business and financial risk 21 \n \n25 The corporate separate commitments discussed in this section can be found on pages 20-23 of the Petition and \nin Ellen Lapson’s direct testimony. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 19 exposures associated with the new parent company, Alloy Parent, as well as its 1 \nsubsidiaries or affiliates, other than subsidiaries of ALLETE. The proposed ring-fencing 2 \nmeasures include maintenance of separate books and records, separate debt and stock, 3 \nand separate corporate and debt credit ratings for ALLETE and Alloy Parent. Other 4 \ncommitments include general prohibitions against direct credit support as well as cross- 5 \ndefault loan provisions.  6 \n  The Parties also pledge that asset transfers, loans or pledges of ALLETE assets 7 \nwill not take place without prior regulatory approval.  Similarly, in terms of dividends, 8 \nALLETE will not make or declare a distribution unless its corporate credit rating is at 9 \nleast investment grade at one of the principal ratings agencies unless first obtaining 10 \nCommission approval.  11 \n  In terms of bankruptcy protections, the Parties state that ALLETE will be 12 \nstructured such that in the event of a bankruptcy of the Parent or any subsidiaries or 13 \naffiliates (other than ALLETE or its subsidiaries), the assets and liabilities of ALLETE will 14 \nnot be consolidated unless required by law; also, any associated bankruptcy costs 15 \ncannot be sought from ALLETE.  16 \n  The proposed ring-fencing measures also include access to ALLETE financial 17 \ninformation and filings and audit rights with respect to documents supporting parent 18 \ncosts that may be allocable to ALLETE. It also offers “appropriate” access to ALLETE 19 \nboard minutes, audit reports, and information provided to credit ratings agency 20 \nregarding ALLETE. To ensure further corporate separateness, the Parties propose to 21 \nprohibit intermediary directors and officers above the Parent level from holding senior 22 \nmanagement positions with ALLETE.  23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 20 Q. Are these sufficient?   1 \nA. While these measures are generally consistent with those that have been proposed in 2 \nother take-private transactions, they are insufficient. For example, the Parties have 3 \nfailed to obtain a legal non-consolidation opinion that would provide greater assurances 4 \nthat ALLETE’s assets would be protected in the event of a Parent or affiliate bankruptcy. 5 \nWhile additional protections are important, they will not address our primary concern 6 \nregarding financial risk exposure, which is the lack of any ring-fencing protections for 7 \nMinnesota Power within ALLETE. 8 \n 9 \nQ. Please elaborate.  10 \nA. There are no ring-fencing protections between Minnesota Power and ALLETE’s non-11 \nregulated businesses, which means the utility is fully exposed to the business and 12 \nfinancial risk of those companies, including bankruptcy. In her testimony, Ms. Lapson 13 \nacknowledges that the Parties’ proposed separateness commitments that I just 14 \ndescribed do not change any issues that may remain within ALLETE.26 15 \n  Minnesota Power is not a separate corporate entity, but rather an operating 16 \ndivision of the parent company ALLETE. Developing effective ring-fencing protections for 17 \na utility that is not a discrete corporate entity would likely be very difficult without first 18 \nadopting a holding company structure. ALLETE is clearly aware of this vulnerability and 19 \nfor whatever reason chose not to address it as part of this proposed transaction.  20 \n \n26 Ex. MP-___ at 11-12 (Lapson Direct). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 21 Q. Does the lack of adequate protection for Minnesota Power represent a significant risk 1 \nto the public interest?   2 \nA. Absolutely. And the likelihood of significant additional investments in ALLETE’s non-3 \nregulated businesses only magnifies that risk. That degree of risk would likely translate 4 \ninto higher costs of debt for Minnesota Power. In printed presentation materials shared 5 \nwith CPP Investments in October 2023, ALLETE indicated [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 6 \nTRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS . . .   7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n . . . HIGHLY 11 \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS] .27 These statements imply that ratepayers 12 \nmay already be experiencing some degree of harm. As such, the Department strongly 13 \nsuggests that these risks to Minnesota Power be eliminated, regardless of whether the 14 \nmerger transaction is ultimately approved.  15 \n 16 \nQ. Has the Commission dealt with similar issues before?  17 \nA. Yes, it has. In 2002, the Commission began an inquiry into the potential impacts of the 18 \nfinancial difficulties of Xcel Energy and its non-regulated subsidiary, NRG, Inc. (“NRG”) 19 \non regulated utility Northern States Power Company.28 The Commission sought ways to 20 \n \n27 Ex.

The 1 \nCommission obtained specific commitments from Xcel Energy and imposed additional 2 \nratepayer safeguards. Within a year of the Commission’s order in that case, however, 3 \nNRG filed for bankruptcy. Highlighting the risks posed by unregulated affiliates in the 4 \nabsence of adequate protections, Xcel Energy was ultimately forced to relinquish its 5 \ninterest in NRG and pay more than $750 million to help settle NRG creditor claims.29  6 \n 7 \nGOVERNANCE 8 \nQ. Please describe the current governance structure of ALLETE.  9 \nA. ALLLETE has a traditional Board of Directors currently with ten members. All but the CEO 10 \nare independent directors that meet the definition of independence under NYSE 11 \nstandards.30 The Board has standard committee charters in the areas of audit, executive 12 \ncompensation and human capital, and corporate governance and nominating.  ALLETE 13 \ndirectors are recommended by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 14 \nand selected by the vote of shareholders. The fiduciary responsibilities of the ALLETE 15 \nBoard are spelled out, and the ALLETE Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for the 16 \nnomination process, conflict of interest rules, independence of directors, and 17 \ncompliance with federal interlocking requirements.31 The current Board and its 18 \n \n29 Smith, Rebecca,  NRG Is Cleared For Emergence From Chapter 11 , Wall Street Journal  (Nov. 25, 2003).  \n30 Per New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual 303A.02, “No director qualifies as ‘independent’ unless \nthe board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the listed \ncompany (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the \ncompany).”  \n31 ALLETE.com, https://www.allete.com/governance  (last visited Feb. 2, 2025).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 23 approach to decision-making is rooted in a history of ALLETE as a regulated business, 1 \nwith a focus on balancing the needs of shareholders, ratepayers, and the community. 2 \n 3 \nQ. Please describe the overall purpose of a Board of Directors.  4 \nA. A Board of Directors is responsible for managing the business and affairs of a 5 \ncorporation, and directors owe fiduciary duties to both the corporation and to the 6 \nshareholders.   Well governed corporations have defined nominating processes for 7 \ndirector selection with detailed standards for membership, voting procedures, and 8 \ntypically, shareholders vote for directors rather than simply appointing them.  9 \n 10 \nQ. Please describe the intended governance of ALLETE and Minnesota Power under the 11 \nproposed transaction.  12 \nA. Relatively little information was provided about how ALLETE will be governed.

We expected to see a proposed 1 \ngovernance structure and governing documents that reflect a commitment to, and a 2 \nrespect for, the regulatory compact that is part and parcel of owning a regulated utility. 3 \nWe did not.  4 \n  The complex organizational and governance structure makes it difficult to 5 \nidentify who the ultimate decisionmaker will be, but it is clear the Partners will have 6 \ncomplete control of these entities. Under the proposed governance structure, the senior 7 \nmanagement of Minnesota Power will likely lose the control and independence in 8 \ndecision-making and operational authority it currently has and which is necessary to 9 \ncontrol, plan, fund, and manage the utility.  The proposed transaction creates an 10 \nunacceptable risk of harm to Minnesota Power and its ratepayers due to the increased 11 \npotential for the new ALLETE Board (or the Boards above it) to make decisions in the 12 \nbest interests of the Partners rather than the utility when conflicts arise.    13 \n  In reaching its conclusion that the proposed governance structure creates an 14 \nunreasonable risk of harm to Minnesota Power and its ratepayers, the Department had 15 \nthe benefit of reviewing allegedly highly confidential trade secret information from the 16 \nPartners, and it is important for the Commission to see some of this information to 17 \nmore fully understand the Department’s level of concern.

There is no assurance, however, that the utility and its ratepayers will be 16 \nprotected when conflicts between their best interests and those of the investors arise. 17 \nInformation in Ex.

Have the Parties made other types of regulatory commitments?15 \nA. Yes, they have made commitments that fall into three broad categories—ratemaking,16 \nemployees and the local community, and current management and local presence. It is 17 \nimportant to emphasize that these are not benefits, but rather commitments to 18 \nmitigate the potential for harm to ratepayers and the public. 19 \n42 Ex.

Please comment on the ratemaking-related commitments.    1 \nA. The Parties have stated that Minnesota Power will not attempt to recover from its 2 \ncustomers (a) the acquisition premium, (b) transaction costs, and (c) transition costs. 3 \nThe acquisition premium reflects a premium of approximately 19 percent per share 4 \nrelative to the closing price for ALLETE shares on December 4, 2023, the last trading day 5 \nprior to when rumors of the proposed acquisition became public. The gain for individual 6 \nshareholders, including ALLETE Board directors and senior management, depends on 7 \nthe purchase price of their stock. Transition costs incurred by ALLETE through 8 \nSeptember 30, 2024 total $26.0 million and include [TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS . . .  9 \n 10 \n . . .  TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS].43 Transactions costs 11 \nhave not yet been incurred and would primarily include the cost of internal employee 12 \nlabor and related overhead. 13 \n  Commitments for non-recovery of such costs are requisites for state regulatory 14 \napproval of utility mergers, and they do protect ratepayers from potential future harm.  15 \nTo ensure proper exclusion from rates, however, adequate accounting methods for 16 \nrecording transaction and transition costs would be required to allow for transparency 17 \nand future auditability.    18 \n  The Parties have also committed that Minnesota Power will use commercially 19 \nreasonable efforts to maintain its debt/equity ratios and its corporate and facility ratings 20 \nin accordance with regulatory requirements.44 This is not actually a commitment, rather 21 \n \n43 Ex.

MP-___ at 22 (Petition). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n\n \n \nVavro Direct / 29 it is an aspiration, and as such a weak protection against future harm to ratepayers in 1 \nterms of increases to the utility’s cost of capital. It is also out of step with the kind of 2 \nconcrete commitments that have been made for other take-private transactions, in 3 \nwhich parties agreed to maintain minimum utility equity percentages. This includes the 4 \nPuget Sound transaction in which CPP Investments participated.   5 \n 6 \nQ.  Please comment on their commitments to employees and the local community.    7 \nA. The Parties have committed to maintaining the current workforce and current 8 \ncompensation and benefits for a period of two years. They have also agreed to honor all 9 \nexisting collective bargaining agreements.45 Maintaining the status quo for two years is 10 \nnot a benefit, it is a short-term protection against future harm.  By way of comparison, 11 \nprivate investor IIF extended non-union employee-related protections for a minimum of 12 \nfive years in its recent acquisitions of both South Jersey Industries and El Paso Electric.   13 \n  It is unclear whether the short-term nature of the employee-related 14 \ncommitments were meant to provide future flexibility in implementing corporate 15 \nrestructuring or downsizing initiatives.  Such plans are ill-conceived if they sacrifice the 16 \ninstitutional knowledge of an experienced utility workforce that is difficult to replace, 17 \npotentially jeopardizing Minnesota Power’s reliability and service quality. 18 \n 19 \n The parties have agreed to maintain certain historic levels of economic development 20 \nand charitable contributions in ALLETE’s service territories.46 They also committed to 21 \n \n45 Id. at 18-19. \n46 Id. at 19. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 30 maintain the overall scope and resources dedicated to Minnesota Power’s affordability 1 \nprograms and to processes that enable resident customer access to such programs.47 2 \nThe duration of these commitments is unclear, and so are at best a means to delay 3 \npotential harm.  These protections are also quite modest—by comparison, for its 4 \nacquisition of South Jersy Industries, IIF made a five-year commitment to provide $1 5 \nmillion per year for additional charitable, economic development, and community 6 \nsupport and an additional $500,000 per year toward low-income assistance. 7 \n 8 \nQ.  Please comment on the commitments to current management and local presence.     9 \nA. The Parties have committed to maintain current management, and decision-making 10 \nspecific to Minnesota Power would remain with local utility management subject to 11 \noversight of the ALLETE Board.48 ALLETE would also maintain the utility’s headquarters 12 \nin Duluth.49 The length of these commitments is unclear. Given the lack of clarity around 13 \ngovernance that I discussed earlier, the actual ability of the utility to maintain 14 \nindependence in day-to-day management is uncertain, as is the freedom for utility 15 \nsenior management to determine the strategic direction, priorities, and capital 16 \nrequirements of Minnesota Power.   17 \n \n47 Id. at 22. \n48 Id. at 19. \n49 Id. at 18. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 31 VI. CONCLUSION  1 \nQ. Please summarize your testimony.   2 \nA. My principal conclusions are as follows: 3 \n The proposed transaction is inconsistent with the public interest and fails to 4 \nmeet the Commission’s approval standards under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50.  There 5 \nare few, if any, positive benefits to ratepayers from this transaction, yet it 6 \nposes significant risks that may negatively impact them.  7 \n Parties to this transaction have numerous and wide-ranging affiliations with 8 \ncompanies in many industries. As such, the potential for conflicts of interest 9 \nand cross-subsidization through affiliated interest contracts with Minneapolis 10 \nPower is high. The Parties’ unwillingness to support the Commission’s due 11 \ndiligence efforts to protect ratepayer from associate harm, as set forth in 12 \nMinn. Stat. § 216B.48, is particularly concerning.  13 \n The proposed governance structure fails to adequately balance the needs of 14 \nshareholders, ratepayers, and the community, and there is a risk of outsized 15 \ninfluence by the Partners on the day-to-day decision-making authority of 16 \nMinnesota Power management.  17 \n Ring-fencing protections are inadequate, and do not sufficiently protect 18 \nMinnesota Power from the effects of financial distress due to ALLETE’s non- 19 \nregulated businesses.  20 \n In all, the regulatory commitments offered by the Parties offer insufficient 21 \nprotections to ratepayers and the public against future harms. 22 \n 23 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \nVavro Direct / 32 Q.

This document was prepared by GIP for its investment committee in May 2024 and \nwas presented to the investment committee of GIP Fund V as part of its final decision to make an investment in \nALLETE. The materials prepared for GIP’s investment committee are customary for any initial investment that GIP \nis considering making through its funds and include valuation information and highlight risks, challenges and \nopportunities related to a particular investment, including a range of potential outcomes, which are  based on \nassumptions the deal team professionals deem appropriate for a particular transaction. However, these materials \nrepresent and are based on projections, ranges of understanding, and scenario planning by GIP based on the \ninformation available at the time, in many cases predating the undertaking or completion of due di ligence. As \nsuch, the  projections are not certain, include outlier scenarios, and are not necessarily scenarios that GIP expects to \nhappen. Once an investment decision has been made, th e materials and risks, projections and other analysis are \nnot updated to reflect information that is learned subsequent to an investment  decision.   The content of these \ndocuments was prepared for limited purposes, may not reflect accurate or current facts or the current views of \nany party to the proposed acquisition, and may include discussion that is not necessarily relevant to the federal or \nstate r egulatory processes.  \n \nThe information herein designated as trade secret has been designated as nonpublic and highly confidential in its \nentirety because it contains information GIP considers to be trade secret as defined by Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. \n1(b). The information deriv es independent economic value from not being generally known to, or readily \nascertainable by proper means by, others who could obtain economic advantage from its disclosure or use and GIP \nmaintains these materials as trade secret pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b). Further, the information is \nhighly confidential commercially sensitive investment and forward -looking analysis pursuant to the Highly \nConfidential Protective Order issued on December 16, 2024.

Provide examples of similar commitments in other transactions and their \nregulatory or credit rating outcomes.  \nRESP\nONSE : \nThe na\nture of this transaction reduces the likelihood of conflict between the best interests of the \nacquired utility and those of the new owners when compared with transactions in which the objective is to roll up a set of utilities and impose economies of  scale, cut staffing, and /or reduce \nlocal management.  This transaction seeks to preserve the Company as a separate entity with \ncontinuity of local management.  It is not in the long -term best interests of the Partners or their \nultimate investors to take a ction in conflict with the financial health or operational needs of the \nCompany and thereby reduce the Company’s long -term value.  Therefore, it is not clear that \nthere is a conflict between the Partners’ fiduciary obligations to its investors and the long -term \nbest interests of the Company.  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx.
