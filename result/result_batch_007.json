There are many reasons that this would be a horribledecision for not only Minnesota residents but Americans in general. This decision would set aprecedence for other private equity groups across the country. Selling a public utility to a privateequity would be dangerous and crooked. Energy should not be dictated by the drive for profits butrather the desire to best serve the residents of Minnesota. The sale of Allete to these firms wouldendanger a majority of Minnesota residents served by this grid, it’s very likely that thesecorporations would pass large future costs off to residents and therefore skyrocket monthly utilities.This would also put reliability of service to Minnesota homes at risk, something that cannot happenfor a multitude of reasons. I can’t think of anything that private equity has taken over from publicmanagement and made that service cheaper, more reliable, or more accessible for the majority ofpeople. This isn’t about a simple sale, this is about principle and about protecting Minnesotans oftoday and of the future. Please do not allow this sale to go through and keep utilities public for thesake of your residents (the people you work for)."

Report all suspicious emails to Minnesota IT ServicesSecurity Operations Center.\n________________________________\nDear Commissioners,\nI am writing as a resident and ratepayer of Minnesota Power to voice my strong and unequivocal opposition to the\nproposed acquisition of ALLETE, our utility's parent company, by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP, a BlackRocksubsidiary) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB).\nAs a captive customer with no choice in who provides my essential electricity service, I am deeply alarmed by the\nrisks this private equity takeover poses to my family’s financial well-being, to local control of our energy future, andto Minnesota’s clean energy goals.\nMy objections are based on the overwhelming evidence presented in this docket, which led Administrative Law\nJudge Megan J. McKenzie to recommend you reject this deal, finding it would result in \"net harm to the public\ninterest\" . I urge you to uphold this recommendation and deny the acquisition for the following reasons:\n 1. This Deal Prioritizes Shareholder Profits Over Ratepayer ProtectionThe core motivation of private equity is to extract maximum returns for its investors in a short time frame, typically\n5-7 years . To pay the massive $1.5 billion premium over ALLETE's book value , GIP and CPPIB will be underimmense pressure to increase revenue. The most direct way to do this is by raising electricity rates on captivecustomers like me. Judge McKenzie's review of nonpublic evidence confirmed this, finding it \"establish[es] that thepartners are planning on significant rate increases\" . We simply cannot afford to have our essential utility servicebecome a vehicle for enriching Wall Street speculators.\n 2. It Threatens Minnesota's Clean Energy Transition\nALLETE has claimed this deal is necessary to fund the transition to clean energy. However, this rationale is deeply\nsuspect. Judge McKenzie found that Minnesota Power’s capital needs for this transition \"are likely overstated\" .Furthermore, BlackRock's recent actions—such as leaving a major climate coalition and its history of opposingclimate-related shareholder motions at fossil fuel companies—cast serious doubt on its commitment to a genuineclean energy future . I am terrified that a private equity owner will prioritize cheap, short-term investments (likenatural gas) over the long-term investments in wind, solar, and storage that our state mandates and our planetrequires.\n 3. It Erodes Local Accountability and TransparencyAs a publicly traded company, ALLETE has certain obligations to public disclosure. Taking it private would shroud\nits operations in secrecy. We have already seen a \"serious lack of transparency\" from the buyers, who have hiddentheir plans behind \"trade secret designations and redactions\" . How can we, as ratepayers, trust an entity that is not\ntransparent with the regulators overseeing it? This deal would move control of our power from Duluth to distant\nboardrooms in New York and Canada, eroding the local accountability we depend on.\n 4. It Creates Pervasive Conflicts of Interest\nBlackRock is a behemoth with investments across the global economy, including in fossil fuels and potentially even\nin the large industrial customers that Minnesota Power serves . This creates an unacceptable risk that decisions aboutour electricity rates and grid investments could be made to benefit BlackRock's other portfolio companies, at theexpense of residential ratepayers. The concentration of power is also alarming; the deal would give the buyerscontrol of 10 out of 13 seats on ALLETE's board , effectively silencing other voices and perspectives.\n 5. The \"Benefits\" Are Illusory and Non-Binding\nThe promises made by the buyers are inadequate and largely unenforceable. A one-time offer to pay off $3.5 million\nin customer debt is a pittance compared to the hundreds of millions in shareholder profits . Commitments to fundcapital investments are self-serving (as they expect a return from us) and are not legally binding terms in the mergeragreement . We are being asked to bear immense, concrete risks in exchange for vague, non-binding promises.\nThis acquisition offers no net benefit to the people of Minnesota. It presents only a transfer of wealth from\nratepayers to shareholders and a transfer of control from Minnesota to Wall Street. The Administrative Law Judge,the Attorney General’s office, consumer advocates (CUB), environmental groups (Sierra Club, CURE), andMinnesota Power’s own largest industrial customers all stand united in opposition because the evidence of harm isso clear.\nI implore you, as my representatives tasked with protecting the public interest, to **reject this heinous deal.** Do\nnot allow private equity greed to jeopardize our wallets, our energy security, and our state’s climate future.\nSincerely,Katherine Bergquist\n5490 Bluebell AveVirginia, MN, 55792Katherine.bergquist@gmail.com(218)591-5311\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nDear Commissioners,\nI am writing to strongly urge the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to reject the proposed\nacquisition of ALLETE and Minnesota Power by BlackRock and its subsidiaries. This dealrepresents a clear threat to Minnesota ratepayers, our state’s energy reliability, and our cleanenergy future.\nJudge McKenzie has already recommended rejecting the transaction, citing increased risks of:\nHigher customer rates\nReduced reliability of service\nWeakened financial stability of Minnesota Power\nObstacles to meeting Minnesota’s clean energy goals\nIt would be extraordinarly foolish to ignore Judge McKenzie's warnings. Private equity firms such as BlackRock have consistently demonstrated that their primary\nfocus is on short-term profit extraction, not long-term community benefit. Across the nation,private equity takeovers of essential services have led to higher costs, poorer reliability, andunderinvestment in critical infrastructure. Allowing such a firm to take control of MinnesotaPower would be a grave mistake with long-lasting consequences. There have been manyrecent examples such as JoAnn's Fabrics, etc. \nThis is not simply a business transaction, it is effectively a TAKEOVER of one of\nMinnesota’s most vital public utilities. The people of Minnesota deserve a utility partner thatprioritizes affordability, reliability, and carbon-free energy, not one driven by Wall Streetprofit motives.\nI strongly encourage the Commission to stand with Minnesotans and reject this acquisition in\norder to protect customers, preserve reliable service, and keep Minnesota on track toward itsclean energy commitments.\nThank you for your consideration and for upholding your responsibility to safeguard the\npublic interest.Sincerely,\nMeghan Kozub\nA Concerned Minnesotan \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nDear Minnesota Public Utilities Commissioners Sieben, Sullivan, Ham, Patridge, and Tuma,\nWith respect to the proposed acquisition of MN Power/Allete, I am writing to express my\nsupport of the July 15th findings of Administrative Law Judge Megan J. McKenzie.\n“In considering the true risks and benefits of the Acquisition, it is critical that the Petitioner’s\nagreements and private discussions do not comport with their public statements. Thenonpublic evidence reveals [GIP and CPP’s] intent to do what private equity is expected to do– pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”1  – Administrative Law\nJudge Megan J. McKenzie \nI also am asking that you take these finding into consideration and reject the proposed\nacquisition of ALLETE, Inc., parent company of Minnesota Power, by Global InfrastructurePartners (“GIP”) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP”) – also known as thePartners – as private equity buyout it is clearly not in the public interest.\nFurthermore, I would like to point out and express my disappointment that the MN DOC, and\noffice of AG Keith Ellision, wrote in support of the acquisition as recently as August 4th, 2025(DOCUMENT ID 20258-221732-01 ). I was shocked to find that AG Keith Ellison's askedthe commision to reject ALJ McKenzies findings, and am highly disturbed by his stark shiftfrom skepticism to full blown support of this acquisition.

Learn why this is important\nVery good. I will submit my comment via this email, per your reply below.\n I am concerned about the news that private equity seeks to acquire one of our local powercompanies. I can’t imagine the scenario where this is a good decision for Minnesotans. Pleaseread Bad Company by Megan Greenwood. Recently published, Greenwood steps through theimpact of PE acquisitions in four different industries. In fact, I believe MN passed regulationsthat preclude private equity from investing in certain healthcare because their aims – investorreturns, pre-empt the public good. Private equity drivers are not aligned with the public good.Please do not allow this acquisition to move forward. I will send copies of the book to you all, ifit helps.

A rate hikereduction of. 07% and a 1 year rate freeze is a paltry deal for the citizens in north Minnesota. \nAs a Minnesotan, I believe we should take care of our own, and that means not selling our utility\ncompanies to the highest bidder. If Minnesota Power doesn't wish to run the energy needs for northMinnesota, then the state should assume control of it and guarantee affordable rates."

Independent Administrative Law Judge Megan J.\nMcKenzie already found that the deal could raise customer rates, weaken grid reliability, andundermine Minnesota’s clean energy goals. While the settlement includes short-term commitmentssuch as a one-year rate freeze, these promises are temporary and do not provide lasting protectionfor customers.\nMinnesota Power is a critical utility for our state. Turning over control to private equity investors\nfocused on maximizing returns creates significant risk for ratepayers, workers, and the transition torenewable energy. The Commission should prioritize affordability, transparency, and long-termenergy security for Minnesotans, not speculative profit for outside investors.\nFor these reasons, I urge the Commission to reject this proposed acquisition.Respectfully,\nAnikaMinnesota"
