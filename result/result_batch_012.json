Sullivan  Vice Chair  \nHwikwon Ham  Commissioner  \nAudrey Partridge  Commissioner  \nJohn Tuma  Commissioner  \n \n \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota \nPower for the Acquisition of ALLETE by \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board and \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners  DOCKET NO.  E-015/PA -24-198 \n \nCOMMENTS OF THE OFFICE OF  \nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL — \nRESIDENTIAL UTILITIES DIVISION  \nON THE STIPULATION BETWEEN \nTHE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF \nCOMMERCE AND PETITIONERS  \n  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Office of the Attorney General —Residential Utilities Division (OAG) submits these \nComments in response to the July 11, 2025 settlement stipulation between the Minnesota \nDepartment of Commerce ; ALLETE, Inc.  d/b/a Minnesota Power ; Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board; and Global Infrastructure Management, LLC  (the stipulation) .  The stipulation \nwas submitted following the close of the evidentiary record and just two business days before the \nAdministrative Law Judge’s report was due.  The Judge was therefore unable to fully incorporate the stipulation into her findings.  The Judge nonetheless reviewed the stipulation and found that it did not change her recommendation to disa pprove ALLETE’s acquisition. \nThe OAG concurs with the J udge .  The weight of the e vidence  establishes  that the proposed \nacquisition would harm  the public interest by raising rates, jeopardizing  ALLETE’s financial \nhealth, threat ening effective regulatory oversight of Minnesota Power, and exposing the utility and \nits customers to financial risks associated with the acquirers’ extensive unregulated holdings.  And, \ngiven the magnitude of the risks presented by the private -equity business model, t he concessions \n2 contained in the stipulation do not come close to rebalancing the acquisition’s risks and benefits \nto avoid causing net harm to the public interest .  The Commission should reject the stipulation and \nadopt the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation not to hand private -equity fund managers  \nthe keys to a Minnesota utility  that provides essential public services .  \nBACKGROUND \nIn July 2024, Minnesota Power filed a petition seeking the Commission’s approval of  a \nproposed acquisition of ALLETE, Inc. (ALLETE  or the Company ) by entities under the control of  \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners1 and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( together, “ the \nPartners ,” and together with ALLETE, “the Petitioners” ). \nThe Commission referred the pr oposed acquisition to the Court  of Administrative H earings  \nfor contested -case proceedings before Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie (the ALJ).   \nOver several months, t he parties litigated the risks and benefits of the acquisition, with the OAG, \nthe Department, and several other intervenors ultimately opposing the acquisition based on their assessment  of those risks and benefits.   \nThe Department was one of the staunchest opponents of the proposed acquisition, with its \nchief witness concluding, in part : \n• The Acquisition is unlikely to provide Minnesota Power with meaningfully \nimproved access to capital, and there is at least some potential that the Acquisition will worsen the Company’s access to capital.  \n• Access to the Partners’ expertise resulting from the Acquisition is unlikely to provide any meaningful benefits to Minnesota Power’s ratepayers or the public interest generally . \n• If the Partners employ financial engineering strategies to increase the returns they earn from their investments in Alloy, the extra debt may cause \n \n1 “Global Infrastructure Partners” is the trading name of Global Infrastructure Management, LLC, \na division of BlackRock. \n3 Minnesota Power’s cost of capital to rise, which would result in rates that \nare higher than they otherwise would have been absent the Acquisition;  \n• Ultimately, the Acquisition should not be expected to provide any meaningful benefits to ratepayers or the public interest, and poses several significant risks  . . . .\n2 \nThe ALJ held an evidentiary hearing in April 2025, and by t he end of May, the parties had \ncompleted briefing.   In its brief, t he Department concluded:  \nPetitioners’ deal, as proposed, will not provide ALLETE reliable capital access. The Partners’ private messages and memoranda establish that this deal presents far more risk than Petitioners publicly acknowledge. Approving this deal will jeopardize ALLETE’ s 2040 energy transition, the company’s long- term financial \nhealth, and the quality and affordability of retail service. Given the balance of benefits and harm, the deal is not consistent with the public interest .\n3 \nOn July 11, two business  days before the ALJ’s report was due, the Department  filed the \nstipulation,  abruptly dropping its opposition to the deal.  The Department now claims that the \nproposed acquisition is suddenly consistent with the public interest because the Petitioners have \nagreed to “more than 70 discrete terms.”4  Yet most of these 70 terms  repeat commitments that the \nPetitioners had already offered or slightly modified versions.  And the few that are truly new do little to counter the significant risks  that the Department previously identified .  Instead  of \nmitigating the transaction’s risks,  the stipulation  continue s a theme of the Partners committing to \nvery little and  avoiding personal liability by making commitments through ALLETE and \nintermediate holding companies .   \nOn July 15, the ALJ issued her report.  The ALJ recommended that the Commission deny \napproval of the proposed acquisition, finding that ALLETE and the Partners had not met their burden to show that the acquisition was consistent with the public interest.\n5  The ALJ clearly stated \n \n2 Addonizio Surrebuttal at 42 (Mar. 25, 2025) . \n3 Department Initial Br. at 44  (May 1, 2025) . \n4 Department Letter at 1 (July 11, 2025). \n5 ALJ Report at 3.  \n4 that while the timing of the stipulation filing did not allow adequate time to incorporate it into her \nreport, she had nonetheless reviewed the stipulation and found that it did not resolve her concerns with the proposed acquisition or change her recommendation to disapprove the acquisition.\n6 \nANALYSIS  \nThe stipulation  does not  rebalance the scales to prevent  the proposed acquisition from \nharm ing the public interest.  On the “benefit ” side of the scale, ALLETE claimed that the \nacquisition would provide it with better access to capital needed to transition to carbon- free energy.  \nHowever, ALLETE failed to establish that the Partners  would provide better access to capital  than \nthe public market, or even that ALLETE needs  better access .  On the “harm” side of the scale,  the \nALJ found that  allowing the  acquisition would risk  serious  harm to ratepayers, ALLETE’s \nfinancial integrity, and the regulatory compact .  Accordingly, the ALJ found that the Petitioners \nfailed to establish that the deal’s possible benefits will be realized or that they equal or outweigh the risks of harm.\n7  The ALJ’s findings  are sound.  \nThe new concessions extracted by the Department  in the stipulation  do not come remotely \nclose to tip ping the balance in favor of approval.  Crucially, t he stipulation does not change the \nfact that ALLETE does not need better access to capital,  and it does not guarantee that the Partners \nwould fund Minnesota Power’s energy transition.  Moreover, the stipulation fails to mitigate the many potential harms of the acquisition to ratepayers, ALLETE’s financial health, and the regulatory compact, nor does it promi se compliance with Minnesota’s requirements for utility \nconflict -of-interest reporting.  On this last point , the stipulation attempts to rewrite Minnesota law \nand bless a practice of  underreporting Minnesota Power’s dealings with affiliates .  For these \n \n6 Id. at 67 n.549.  \n7 Id. at 61 ¶ 16.  \n5 reasons and those  explained below and in the ALJ’s report, the Commission should reject the \nstipulation and adopt the ALJ’s recommendation to deny approval of the proposed acquisition. \nI. THE STIPULATION DOES NOT MITIGATE RATE-RELATED RISKS OR MATERIALLY \nINCREASE RATEPAYER BENEFITS . \nAccording to documents that the Petitioners have withheld from the public, the Partners \nplan to seek outsized returns on their proposed investment in ALLETE.8  The Petitioners have also \nclaimed that the proposed acquisition will not impact retail rates, but again, their private documents \nsuggest otherwise, with projections of future rate increases that would greatly exceed projected \ninflation.9  Based on this nonpublic evidence, the ALJ concluded that the acquisition “ creates an \nunacceptable risk of rate increase and rate shock in a critical and economically vulnerable area of \nMinnesota .”10  She came to this conclusion in spite of Petitioners’ commitment not to seek rate \nrecovery of the acquisition premium, transaction costs, or transition costs,11 as well as certain other \nrate-related commitments.12 \nThe stipulation includes four new or modified rate -related commitments.  For the reasons \ndiscussed below, however, these commitments entirely fail to mitigate the significant rate -related \nrisks presented by the proposed acquisition.  At most, the commitments provide short -term benefits \nthat do not counter the long- term rate risks that the transaction presents.  \nFirst, under the stipulation, Minnesota Power would waive its right to file a rate case before \nNovember 2026.13  While a reprieve from rate increases is certainly welcome, it is not clear \nwhether Minnesota Power could realistically file a rate case sooner than late 2026 given that the \n \n8 Id. ¶¶ 214 –15. \n9 See id. ¶¶ 218 –22. \n10 Id. ¶ 222.  \n11 See id.  ¶ 213.  \n12 See id.  ¶¶ 153 –61. \n13 Stipulation ¶ 1.43.  \n6 current proceeding will not be complete until late 2025, and an acquisition, if approved, likely \nwould not close until several months after that.  In its cover letter, the Department claims that this “stay out” commitment would save ratepayers $25 million but fails to provide any basis for this estimate.\n14  In any event, this brief reprieve from rate increases is inadequate to counter the serious \nlong- term risks that the acquisition presents to ratepayers.  \nSecond, the stipulation provides for Minnesota Power’s currently approved return on \nequity (ROE) to be temporarily reduced from 9.78 percent to 9.65 percent.15  The change would \ntake place in the first full month after the later of (a) the acquisition’s closing and (b) the Commission’s order becoming final.\n16  The change would remain in effect only until Minnesota \nPower files its next rate case, likely in November 2026.17  The Department claims this would yield \na savings of $5.5 million but, again, provides no support for its calculation.18   \nSimilar to the stay -out commitment, this temporary ROE reduction fails to mitigate the \nacquisition’s significant, long- term rate- related risks.  Moreover, the ROE reduction appears to \nduplicate Minnesota Power’s commitment not to recover flotation costs.19  Minnesota Power will \nno longer incur flotation costs if the acquisition is approved.20  Therefore, it is unclear why an \nROE reduction for flotation costs should end with Minnesota Power’s next rate case.  \n \n14 Department Letter at 2 (July 11, 2025). \n15 Stipulation ¶ 1.14.  \n16 Id. \n17 Id.  While the reduced ROE would continue to apply during the pendency of the next rate case, \nthere is no limit on the overall size of the interim -rate increase Minnesota Power may propose.  \nOther cost increases  in interim rates  could easily swamp the impact of the ROE reduction.  \n18 Department Letter at 2 (July 11, 2025). \n19 See Stipulation at 4 n.5 (stating that ROE reduction “ includes Minnesota Power’s commitment \nnot to seek recovery of flotation costs ”). \n20 ALJ Report ¶ 157.  \n7 Third, the stipulation provides that, if Minnesota Power’s cost of debt were to increase \nabove current levels within five years after the close of the acquisition, Minnesota ratepayers “will \nbe held harmless from any rate impact unless Minnesota Power can demonstrate that its increased cost of debt was not caused by the Acquisition.”\n21  This commitment is a modification of the \nPetitioners’ previous commitment to hold ratepayers harmless from cost- of-debt increases for three \nyears.  The ALJ found that a three -year hold -harmless commitment was a weak concession because \nany impact to Minne sota Power’s cost of debt from the acquisition would be unlikely to materialize \nin a significant way within three years.22  It is unclear whether extending the term by two years \nwould capture significant cost -of-debt increases from the acquisition, which are likely to \nmaterialize in a more significant way over the long term as the Partners take on more debt.  The \nfive-year commitment would still allow Minnesota Power to burden ratepayers with cost -of-debt \nincreases that  the acquisition causes in later years.  Forcing ratepayers to bear debt costs caused \nby the acquisition five, six, or any number of years after closing is unreasonable.  \nFinally, the stipulation provides for Minnesota Power to submit a plan to credit ratepayers \nwith existing and future proceeds from the sale of land surrounding its hydroelectric reservoirs, as \nidentified in Docket No. E -015/PA -20-675.23  But t his commitment simply promises to do what \nthe Commission has already ordered Minnesota Power to do—sell unneeded land and credit the proceeds back to ratepayers .\n24  The stipulation also contemplates that  Minnesota Power will credit \nratepayers with the proceeds from the sale of other  lands that have  been in utility rate base.25  This \ncommitment similarly lacks value: when Minnesota Power sells land that was part of its ratepayer -\n \n21 Stipulation ¶ 1.12.  \n22 ALJ Report ¶ 145.  \n23 Stipulation ¶ 1.45.  \n24 See Order Allowing Land Sales and Establishing Conditions at 5 (Nov. 18, 2021). \n25 Stipulation ¶ 1.46.  \n8 funded utility plant, the only reasonable course of action is to credit ratepayers with the proceeds.  \nMoreover, the re is  nothing in this commitment to  guarantee that the price obtained will be \nreasonable—particularly for sales of high- value land near utility infrastructure that is ideally suited \nfor siting data centers  or other large industrial uses .  The lack of commitment on the price of land \nsales is particularly troubling given the stipulation’s failure to include provisions that effectively \ndisclose affiliated interest arrangements, discussed further below.   Like the other rate -related \ncommitments, the land -sale commitments  are of little value and utterly inadequate to counter the \nrisk that rates will become unaffordable under the Partners’ ownership.  \nII. THE STIPULATION DOES NOT ENSURE THAT THE PARTNERS WOULD FUND MINNESOTA \nPOWER ’S ENERGY TRANSITION . \nALLETE has framed the proposed acquisition as a way to access the capital  it need s for \nthe energy transition.  But the record establishes that ALLETE’s alleged capital need can be mitigated and is likely overstated.\n26  The record also reflects no previous instances where ALLETE \nwas unable to obtain capital from the public market, and no credible evidence that the public market cannot meet ALLETE’s legitimate capital needs in the future.\n27  Moreover, despite touting \nthe acquisition as the solution to its capital needs, ALLETE did not even ask the Partners for a \ncapital -funding commitment until intervenor testimony made it appear that such a commitment \nwould help secure approval.28  This capital commitment, however, has significant shortcomings, \nidentified by the ALJ, that undermine its value.29  The stipulation attempts to shore up this deficient \ncommitment to no avail.   \n \n26 ALJ Report ¶¶ 122–28.  \n27 Id. ¶¶ 131 –35. \n28 Id. at 66. \n29 See id. ¶¶ 140 –41. \n9 Under the stipulation, as in prior iterations, the capital- funding commitment would last \nonly five years —insufficient time to fully see Minnesota Power through the energy transition.30  \nMoreover, the commitment continues to be made not by the Partners but by Alloy Parent (the \nentity that would directly own ALLETE ), and there is no requirement that Alloy Parent provide \nany new equity at all —it may simply reinvest ALLETE’s earnings or take on additional debt, \nsecured by its interest in ALLETE, to meet the commitment.31  These are things that ALLETE can \nalready do without being acquired by private equity.     \nIn an attempt to give teeth to the commitment, the stipulation adds a new mechanism by \nwhich the Commission could prevent ALLETE from paying dividends if Minnesota Power has not \n“been provided sufficient equity capital needed up to that point in time to fund the 5- year capital \ninvestment plan .”32  This mechanism, however, contains vague language that undermines its \nefficacy.  For example, the Partners  can avoid its application through undefined “reasonable and \nprudent plan reductions.”33  More importantly, increasing the enforceability of a commitment that \nhas little value in the first place does not make the commitment any more valuable, nor does it alter the public -interest balance found by the ALJ.   \nFinally, the stipulation provides for a “Clean Firm Technology Fund,” under which Alloy \nParent would contribute $50 million over a period of years to a fund earmarked for investments in “clean firm technology.”\n34  “Clean firm technology” means “a carbon -free resource, as defined by \nMinn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 1(b), that can be dispatched and provide energy continuously for \n \n30 Id. ¶ 141  \n31 See Stipulation ¶ 1.3. \n32 Id. ¶ 1.4; see also id. ¶ 1.5. \n33 Id. ¶ 1.4.  \n34 Id. ¶ 1.63.  \n10 a duration of 50 hours or more.”35  While contributions to the fund would not themselves be rate -\nrecoverable, any other portion of a project to which these funds are applied could be recovered \nfrom ratepayers.36  And, similar to the above -discussed capital commitment, there are no \nrestrictions on Alloy Parent paying for contributions to the fund using ALLETE’s earnings or \nadditional debt secured by ALLETE’s shares.   \nWhile the stipulation characterizes the “Clean Firm Energy Fund” as an environmental \ncommitment, it may be  better understood as a rate -related commitment.  But, however the \ncommitment is characterized, its benefits are limited.    \nWhether  or not  a Clean Firm Energy Fund is created, ALLETE must comply with the \ncarbon -free standard, and its method of compliance, including the use of clean firm energy, will \nbe overseen by the Department and the Commission.  Moreover, while $50 million is a substantial \nsum, it is unlikely to have a large impact in the context of Minnesota Power’s overall investments, which ALLETE projects to be more than $4 billion over the next five years.\n37  Even if th at \nprojection is overstated, $50 million  is a relative drop in the bucket.  For these reasons, it is  unclear \nhow much environmental benefit this commitment provides.   \nMoreover, w hile a “free” $50 million investment in clean energy could benefit ratepayers, \nit could also harm them by creating headroom for ALLETE to make larger, more expensive investments than it otherwise would have.  Moreover, the fact that the fund contributions are not \nrate-recoverable could incentivize ALLETE to make up for them elsewhere, through more frequent \nor larger rate -increase requests.  Finally, the Partners are likely to fund the $50 million by taking \n \n35 Id. ¶ 1.63(c).  \n36 Id. ¶ 1.63(d).  \n37 ALJ Report ¶ 123.  \n11 on additional debt, which could have detrimental impacts on ALLETE’s financial health, as \ndiscussed in the ALJ’s report and Section III below, and drive up Minnesota Power’s debt costs. \nIII. THE STIPULATION DOES NOT MITIGATE RISKS TO MINNESOTA POWER ’S FINANCIAL \nHEALTH . \nToday, ALLETE’s overall financial health is strong.38  If the Partners are allowed to \nacquire ALLETE, however, their plans to pursue aggressive rates of return and take on increasing \ndebt could adversely affect ALLETE’s long- term financial health.39  Moreover, if the Partners \nwere unable to extract their desired returns , there is a risk that they w ould seek to unload their \ninvestment in ALLETE in the near term, leading to an inefficient sale of the company.40  The \nstipulation does not  mitigate  these risks , which are a product of the private -equity investment \nmodel and thus unavoidable if the Partners are allowed to acquire ALLETE . \nAs noted earlier , the stipulation contains a mechanism by which the Commission could \nprevent ALLETE from paying dividends to Alloy Parent unless “ Minnesota Power has been \nprovided sufficient equity capital needed up to that point in time to fund the 5- year capital \ninvestment plan in the February 2025 10- K.”41  This does nothing, however, to prevent the “Alloy” \nentities from taking on additional debt  that could impair ALLETE’s creditworthiness , nor does it \nlessen the risk of an untimely exit.  If anything, exercising the mechanism would increase the risk of an early exit by making it more difficult for the Partners to extract returns from their investment.  \nALLETE and the Partners have also proposed a number of “ring fencing”  conditions that \nwould alleg edly insulate  ALLETE and Minnesota Power from Partner -related financial risks.   \nThese conditions include , for example, prohibitions on using utility property to guarantee Alloy \n \n38 Id. ¶ 66.  \n39 Id. ¶¶ 1 88–99.  \n40 Id. ¶ 211.  \n41 Stipulation ¶ 1.4; see also id. ¶ 1.5. \n12 Parent debt  and loans between Minnesota Power and Alloy Parent .42 The ALJ , however, found \nthat the se and other  proposed ring- fencing conditions were inadequate to insulate Minnesota \nPower’s ratepayers for higher debt costs resulting from exposure to the risks of debt held at Alloy \nParent.43   \nThe stipulation  reiterates  the previous  ring-fencing conditions without mate rial change.44  \nTo the extent that these conditions were already in the record and considered by the ALJ, they do not alter her public- interest determination.  Moreover, even as phrased in the stipulation, the \nproposed ring- fencing conditions  continue to leave many risks unaddressed, as shown in Table 1, \nbelow .  Table 1  is provided for illustrative purposes and does not reflect every propose d ring-\nfencing provision or every potential risk.  \nTable 1 – \nAcquisition Ringfencing Matrix  \nRisk that Petitioners Have Proposed One or \nMore  Conditions to Address  Entity Condition Applies To  \nALLETE, \nInc.

See \nStipulation n.4. \n46 The stipulation references Partner “subsidiaries or affiliates” without defining either term.  See  \nStipulation ¶ 1.21.  Partner “subsidiaries” presumably refers to portfolio companies held by Fund \nV, Tower Bridge, and CPP Investment Board Private Holdings (5) Inc.  See id.  n.4.  It is unclear \nwhether “affiliate” is intended to refer to Fund V’s limited partners; the portfolio companies or limited partners of other GIP funds; Global Infrastructure Management, LLC; and/or other entities in BlackRock’s corporate hierarchy. \n47 Stipulation ¶ 1.16.  Alloy Parent may not use “utility assets” to secure its own debt.  It is not , \nhowever, prohibited under paragraph 1.16 from using ALLETE’s nonutility assets for this purpose.  \n48 Id. ¶ 1.18(b).  \n49 Id. ¶ 1.17. \n13 Risk that Petitioners Have Proposed One or \nMore  Conditions to Address  Entity Condition Applies To  \nALLETE, \nInc.

N/A \n \nAs Table 1 illustrates, many affiliate -related financial  risks are left unaddressed by the \nstipulation.  A dditional a ffiliate-related  risks  left unaddressed by the stipulation are discussed \nfurther in S ection V below.  \nFinally, the stipulation would require ALLETE to propose the creation of a separate \nholding company for Minnesota Power, which is currently a business unit of ALLETE without separate legal existence.\n61  The  fact that Minnesota Power is a division of ALLETE, rather than a \n \n50 See ALJ Report ¶ 148 & n.253. \n51 See i d. \n52 Stipulation ¶ 1.21 \n53 Id. \n54 Id. \n55 Id.

And, even if Minnesota Power becomes a separate entity from ALLETE, this would do nothing to address underl ying risks to \nMinnesota Power’s financial health —increased debt at the parent level  and the risk that the \nPartners could abandon their investment prematurely. IV. T\nHE STIPULATION DOES NOT MITIGATE RISKS TO THE REGULATORY COMPACT . \nThe ALJ found that the proposed acquisition threatens  the regulatory compact —i.e., \neffective oversight of  Minnesota Power —because it would result in less transparency and because \nthe Partners’ behavior in th is proceeding suggest s that they would be less cooperative owners.64  \nOn the last point , the ALJ found:  “The Partners’ lack of cooperation in this proceeding further \nestablishes a material risk that ALLETE’s transparency may suffer under their ownership. Any reduction in cooperation by the utility would harm the public interest by increasing the burden on regulators and the likelihood of worse regulatory outcomes for ratepayers.”\n65  The ALJ also \ndetermined that the contrast  between “the Petitioner s’ agreements and private discussions” and \n“their public statements” was an important consideration.66  The ALJ determined that it was “at \nbest unclear how the Commission would enforce any of the commitments made by the Petitioners \nthat are not already required by law ,” and noted the only $1,000 per violation available under \n \n62 See Vavro Direct at 20.  \n63 Id. at 21. \n64 ALJ Report ¶¶ 235–49.  \n65 Id. ¶ 249.  \n66 Id. at 66.  \n15 Minnesota statute  and the difficulty with forcing Partners to take certain actions.67  Last, the ALJ \nnoted the vast resources that would be required to monitor compliance with commitments .68  \nThe stipulation , however,  appears to contain no new commitments to improve post -closing  \ntransparency , such as continuing the financial reporting that is  required of ALLETE as a public \ncompan y.  No r does the stipulation effectively mitigate the Partners’ potential lack of cooperation \nidentified by the ALJ.  The  stipulation contains two types of conditions, discussed below, that \ncould potentially mitigate some of the risks posed by the Partners’ motivations  as private- equity \ninvestors , but these conditions f all short of protecting the public interest on this record.  While  no \nconditions can completely mitigate these risks, the ones proposed are likely to be wholly \nineffective.  \nThe first set of condition s that could, in theory, help protect the regulatory compact relate \nto board control.  But they fall short  because the Partners will appoint  every single board member  \neither directly or, in the case of the CEO , indirectly through the other appointed board members . \nIf the Partners did not control ALLETE’s board, they would be unable to influence its actions, \nincluding its regulatory advocacy.  T he Partners , however, have insisted on having full control \nover ALLETE,69 consistent with private -equity investment strategies generally.70  The stipulation \ndoes not change t he essential power dynamic of the board from what the Partners previously \nproposed.  It adds one additional board member (14 instead of 13)  but does not change the fact \nthat all members would be directly or indirectly  chosen by the Partners .71  On top of that, only 6 \nout of the 14, a minority, would be required to meet the New York Stock Exchange’s definition of \n \n67 Id. at 66–67.  \n68 Id. at 67.  \n69 See Vavro Direct at 26.  \n70 ALJ Report ¶ 251.  \n71 Stipulation ¶ 1.23(b). \n16 “independent.”72  In addition to fully controlling the board, the Partners would have consent rights  \n(essentially, veto rights)  over certain material actions  of ALLETE and could override the board’s \ndecisions .73  Given the Partners’ control of the board and their consent rights, the ALJ found a  \nmaterial  risk that the interests of Minnesota Power  and its ratepayers might receive short shrift \nfollowing an acquisition.74   The stipulation does not change this situation. \nSecond, m eaningful enforceability provisions could theoretically  help mitigate risks to the \nregulatory compact by making violations of Minnesota law or Commission order easier to punish.  \nThe ALJ , however, was skeptical of the enforceability of the Petitioners’ commitments and noted \nthat “[t] he Partners themselves have carefully committed to do very little, instead largely making \ncommitments through expected holding companies or Minnesota Power itself.”75   \nThe lack of commitments by the Partners —that is, by Global Infrastructure Management \nor the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board —is a theme that continues in the stipulation.  In \nfootnote four, the stipulation carefully qualifies that, “[w] ith respect to the commitments herein, . \n. . ‘Partners ’ refers to (i) the funds managed by GIP participating in this transaction, namely GIP \nFund V and Tower Bridge and (ii) CPP Investment Board Private Holdings (5) Inc. ”76  In other \nwords, references in the stipulation to “Partners” refer only to the funds that would hold an interest in ALLETE, not to the entities that would actually control those funds.  While  a rational private -\nequity firm m ight want  to limit its liability,  it is equally reasonable  for the Commission to find that \nthe private -equity model simply poses too many risks when applied to a Minnesota utility.  \n \n72 Id. ¶ 1.23(b)(1).  \n73 See ALJ Report ¶¶ 260– 66. \n74 See i d. ¶¶ 150, 256–66.  \n75 Id. at 66 –67 \n76 Stipulation at 2 n.4.  \n17 The stipulation adds two new enforcement conditions that the Partners had not previously \nproposed.  T hese conditions fail , however, to provide  any assurance that if a condition  of approval \nwere violated, the violation would be easily remedied.   \nThe stipulation provides that (1) “any failure  to achieve any commitment in this Settlement, \nor to comply with any other condition the Commission places on approval of the Acquisition, is a \nviolation of the Commission’s order under Minn. Stat. § 216B.54” and (2) “ ALLETE and Partners \nsubmit to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and then of the courts of the State of Minnesota with respect to any action brought to enforce or resolve a dispute arising from an applicable commitment.”\n77  Item (1) merely states the obvious —“a violation is a violation .”  Item (2) is also \na no-brainer, but it is worth less than  its face value because “Partners” as used in the stipulation \nrefers only to the funds that will own ALLETE, not to Global Infrastructure Management  or \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board.  Thus, once again, the Partners  have carefully avoided \nhaving any skin in the game. \nFinally, even with these commitments, the Commission’s enforcement options under 216B \nwould be  limited —a penalty of up to $1,000 per “knowing[] and intentional[] violation” of a \nCommission order or provision of chapter 216B.78  Thus, even if regulators were able to detect a \nviolation, the maximum statutory penalty is only $1,000—peanuts for a typical private -equity \ninvestor —and obtaining even that modest penalty would require proof that the violation was \ncommitted knowingly and  intentionally.   For these reasons, t he stipulation’s enforcement \nprovisions are unlikely to have a deterrent effect or make ratepayers whole for any violation.  \n \n77 Stipulation ¶¶ 1.73–.74. \n78 Minn. Stat. § 216B.57.  \n18 V. THE STIPULATION DOES NOT ENVISION COMPLIANCE WITH THE AFFILIATED -INTEREST \nSTATUTE OR OTHERWISE MITIGATE SELF-DEALING RISKS. \nMinnesota’s affiliated -interest statute , Minn. Stat. § 216B.48, is intended to prevent \nconflicts of interest and cross subsidies between public utilities and their affiliates.79  By requiring \nCommission approval of a utility’s contracts with affiliated entities, the statute helps ensure that \nratepayers are protected from paying too much for “sweetheart deals .”80  If the acquisition were \napproved, ALLETE will become affiliated with the vast network of companies contained in the \nPartners’ portfolios, creating many opportunities for self -dealing transactions.81   \nThe Petitioners originally proposed submitting for approval only affiliate  contracts worth \n$1 million or more ,82 even though the statute requires  that any affiliate contract worth more than \n$50,000 be submitted to the Commission.83  The Petitioners have also used a working definition \nof “affiliated interest” that i s different  than the statute’s definition .84  For example, Petitioners \npropose to report  affiliate contract s with “suppliers, and any industrial customers with contracted \nrates .”85  But “suppliers” is left undefined and does not clearly include  affiliated  entities that \ncontract with ALLETE for purposes other than to “supply” goods. \nThe ALJ found Petitioners’ affiliated -interest commitments inadequate  and out of step with \nother recent take- private transactions where acquirers agreed to fully comply with the \njurisdiction’s affiliated -interest statutes, rules, and regulations .86  She further found that the \nPartners’ extensive holdings , coupled with their planned control over ALLETE , heighten the very \n \n79 ALJ Report ¶ 267.  \n80 Id.; see Minn. Stat. § 216B.48, subds. 1, 3. \n81 See Ex. DOC -301 at 14 (Vavro Direct).  \n82 ALJ Report ¶ 269.  \n83 Id. ¶ 270.  \n84 Id. ¶ 271.  \n85 Stipulation ¶ 1.29(a). \n86 ALJ Report ¶¶ 152, 271, 275. \n19 risks that the statute is intended to address and recommended requiring full compliance with the \nstatute.87 \nThe stipulation continues to propose a cutoff much higher than the statute ’s—$500,000—\nand to use the Petitioners’ working definition of an “affiliated interest.”88  While the stipulation \nstates  that its affiliated -interest proposals are “[i]n addition to, and not in abrogation of, any \nobligations” under the statute,89 proposing that certain things will  be reported implies that other \nthings will not.  Simply put, the Commission should not sanction self -dealing -related  conditions \nthat are inconsistent with Minnesota law.   \nMoreover, the Petitioners’ definition of “affiliated interest”  appears to leave out important \nentities that should be reported whether or not they come within the statutory definition.  Under \nthe stipulation, ALLETE commit s to report contracts with  suppliers and industrial customers who \nare “more than 5 percent owned by CPP Investments, GIP, or BlackRock, Inc .”90  But  entities that \nare “more than 5 percent owned by CPP Investments, GIP, or BlackRock, Inc .” does not  cover the \nfull panoply of business relationships that could result in self -dealing or  harm to ratepayers , since \nit does not include assets that the Partners manage or control but do not actually own.   \nFor example, i t is unclear whether th e stipulation  is intended to cover  Fund V portfolio \ncompanies or portfolio companies of other GIP funds  when those companies contract with \nALLETE.  Global Infrastructure Management does not , to the OAG’s knowledge, invest \nsignificant amounts of  its own capital  in Fund V or its other funds .  Instead, most of the ownership \ninterest  in a private -equity fund rests with the fund’s limited partners.91  Therefore , if “GIP” is \n \n87 Id. ¶ 275.  \n88 Stipulation ¶ 1.29.  \n89 Id. \n90 Id. \n91 Lebens Direct at 10.  \n20 intended to refer to Global Infrastructure Management, consistent with paragraph (D) of the \nstipulation, it is unlikely that ALLETE would have to report any contracts with Fund V assets or \nother GIP fund assets.  On the other hand, if “GIP” is intended to refer to GIP Fund V and Tower Bridge, consistent with footnote four, then ALLETE would have to report any contracts with Fund \nV and Tower Bridge portfolio companies (assuming they met the five -percent ownership \nthreshold) but not  contracts with companies i n any other GIP -managed funds, even if a company \nrepresented more than five percent of the fund and the contract were worth more than $500,000.   \nThis lack of clarity further erodes the stipulation’s already inadequate affiliated -interest \nconditions.  And t he significant blind spots in the stipulation’s affiliated -interest commitments are \nnot a theoretical concern .  For example, the record contains evidence Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board may intend to facilitate an introduction between Minnesota Power and Octopus Energy, a company in which CPPIB owns  a large stake.\n92  It is unclear whether the stipulation \nwould require ALLETE to disclose any contracts it may enter into with Octopus , potentially \nleaving the Commission and ratepayers in the dark as to the existence and reasonableness of those contracts . \nCONCLUSION \nIn general, the stipulation proposes conditions that are (1) already in the record, (2) illusory \nand ineffective, or (3) of marginal value.  H anding private -equity fund managers the keys to a \nMinnesota utility company under these conditions  still carries  far too many risks to justify any  \nmarginal potential benefit.  Were the Commission to approve an acquisition, the agency  would \nstand as the last line of defense against harm s to Minnesota Power and its customers  from the \nprivate -equity investment model .  Ye t the Commission w ould lack transparency into the  Partners’ \n \n92 Addonizio Surrebuttal at 25. \n21 plans, relationships, and activities  or any ability to control their behavior  beyond punishing \nMinnesota Power.  For these reasons and all the reasons set forth in the ALJ’s report, the \nCommission should reject the stipulation and deny approval of the proposed acquisition.   \nD\nated:  August 4, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \nK\nEITH ELLISON  \nAttorney General  \nState of Minnesota \n/s/ Peter G.

Sullivan  Vice Chair  \nHwikwon Ham  Commissioner  \nAudrey Partridge  Commissioner  \nJohn Tuma  Commissioner  \n \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota \nPower for the Acquisition of ALLETE by \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board and \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners  DOCKET NO.  E-015/PA -24-198 \n \nEXCEPTIONS OF THE OFFICE OF  \nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL — \nRESIDENTIAL UTILITIES DIVISION  \nTO THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW \nJUDGE’S REPORT   \n \nThe Office of the Attorney General —Residential Utilities Division (OAG) submits these \nexceptions  in response to the July 15, 2025 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and \nRecommendations of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ’s report).  Based on a voluminous \nrecord, including a three -day evidentiary hearing, the ALJ concluded that the Petitioners had not \nmet their burden of proof to show that the proposed acquisition of ALLETE is consistent with the public interest.  The ALJ therefore recommended that the Commission deny approval of the proposed acquisition. \nFor the reasons explained below, the OAG recommends that the Commission adopt the \nALJ’s report in full.  In addition, the OAG requests that the Commission rule on its March 17, 2025 motion to publicly release rate -increase projections that ALLETE furnished to the Partners \nin negotiating the deal  but has thus far withheld from the public. \nI. THE COMMISSION SHOULD ADOPT THE ALJ’ S REPORT IN FULL.  \nThe ALJ’s report is well -reasoned, comprehensive, and thorough.  The report examines \neach potential benefit and detriment of the proposed acquisition, including the Petitioners’ \n2 48 proposed commitments.  The ALJ finds the commitments to be of limited value.1  The ALJ also \nfinds that new commitments in a July 11 stipulation between the Minnesota Department of \nCommerce and the Petitioners do not change her recommendation to deny approval.2 \nIn her conclusions of law and an attached memorandum, the ALJ lays out several key \nfindings, including that:  \n• The Petitioners have not shown that the proposed acquisition will improve ALLETE’s \naccess to capital or even that ALLETE needs improved access.3 \n• The Petitioners did not prove by a preponderance of evidence that they will be unable \nto meet the Carbon Free Standard without the acquisition, or that the standard will be \nmet as a result of the acquisition.4 \n• The acquisition poses foreseeable risks of harm to ratepayers, the energy transition, and \nALLETE’s long -term financial health.5 \n• On balance, risks of the deal outweigh the possible benefits, and approval of the \nacquisition would result in net harm to the public interest.6 \nEach of these findings is supported by substantial record evidence and reflects the ALJ’s \ncredibility determinations7 regarding the acquisition’s potential benefits and harms.  The OAG \nconcurs with the ALJ’s findings, conclusions, and recommendation to deny approval of the \nproposed acquisition.  The Commission should adopt her report in full.  \nII. THE OAG TAKES EXCEPTION TO THE ALJ  REPORT ’S LACK OF RUL ING \nON THE OAG’S MOTION TO LIFT TRADE -SECRET DESIGNATIONS.  \nThe OAG takes exception to the ALJ’s report in only one respect: its  omission of a ruling  \non the OAG’s motion to lift trade -secret designations.  On March 17, 2025, the OAG filed a motion \n \n1 See ALJ Report ¶¶ 140– 80. \n2 See id.  at 67 n.549.  \n3 Id. at 61 ¶ 16.  \n4 Id. at 66. \n5 Id. at 61 ¶ 16.  \n6 Id. \n7 See, e.g., id. at 25, 40, 44, 45, 47, 66, 67 n.547. \n3 to remove trade- secret protection from rate -increase projections that ALLETE provided to the \nPartners in negotiating the proposed acquisition.  The Minnesota Department of Commerce filed \na memorandum in support of the OAG’s motion, and ALLETE filed a response in opposition.  Despite listing the motion and responses in its procedural history,\n8 the ALJ’s report does not rule \non the motion or contain any other findings concerning it.   \n“Once a judge has issued a report . . . the judge loses jurisdiction to amend the report.”9  \nMotions made to the ALJ that have not been certified to the Commission are to be “considered by the agency in its consideration of the record as a whole subsequent to the filing of the judge’s report.”\n10  For the reasons given in the OAG’s memorandum in support of the motion and \ndiscussed below, the Commission should grant the motion to lift trade- secret designations.  \nIII. MOTION TO LIFT TRADE- SECRET DESIGNATIONS  \nThe OAG incorporates its prior motion filing by reference11 and requests a ruling that \nALLETE’s responses to Sierra Club IR No. 26 (including attachment 26.02) and OAG IR No. 42 do not meet the definition of “trade secret information” under Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 2(a).  The Commission should further require ALLETE to provide updated public versions of these documents with the inappropriate redactions removed.\n12 \nAll government data is presumed public unless subject to a statutory exception.13  As the \nDepartment concluded, there is “clearly a significant public interest” in understanding the rate \n \n8 Id. ¶¶ 42, 44, 46. \n9 Minn. R. 1400.8300. \n10 Minn. R. 1400.7600. \n11 Notice of Motion and Motion to Lift Trade Secret Designations  (Mar. 17, 2025). \n12 In addition to being attached to the OAG’s motion, the information requests at and/or \nattachments  at issue  have been filed in eDockets  in Ex. Sierra -1100 (Lane Direct, attach. CL -3) \nand Ex. OAG-402 (Lebens Surrebuttal, sched. BPL-S- 1). \n13 Minn. Stat. § 13.03, subd. 1. \n4 increases on which the proposed acquisition is premised.14  Releasing the data is particularly \nimportant for public transparency because, as the ALJ found, “Petitioners’ agreements and private \ndiscussions do not comport with their public statements” about the acquisition.15   \nThe key element of trade secret data is that it “derives independent economic value . . . \nfrom not being generally known to . . . other persons who can obtain economic value from its \ndisclosure or use.”16  ALLETE’s chief  concern with releasing the information  here is not that \nothers will derive economic value  from it , but that the projections will be taken out of context.17  \nBut the risk that data will be taken out of context is not a basis for withholding it under the \nMinnesota Government Data Practices Act.  The standard is not that information is embarrassing \nor inconvenient —or even, as framed by ALLETE, that its disclosure poses “a significant risk of \nharm”18 to ALLETE.  Rather, the focus of the standard is on how other persons  can derive \neconomic value from the information. \nThe data in dispute here include projections of Minnesota Power’s revenue requirements \nover 2023–2032.19  The overall revenue requirements are allocated to each customer class in \nproportion to the class’s base revenue as a high- level modeling assumption.20  Minnesota Power’s \nretail customer s are generally  captive and have no alternatives.  As a result, t here would appear to \nbe little if any competitive advantage in  maintaining the secrecy of these project ions, and i t is hard \nto fathom what a competitor of ALLETE, if one exists, would do with the m. \n \n14 Department Memo. at 2 (Mar. 25, 2025).  \n15 ALJ Report at 66.  \n16 Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b).  \n17 See Minnesota Power Memo. in Opposition to Motion at 4, 8–10 (Mar. 31, 2025). \n18 See id. at 7.  \n19 Response to Sierra Club IR No. 26.  \n20 Response to OAG IR No. 42. \n5 The only even remotely plausible basis that ALLETE has identified for the projections \nbeing trade secret is that large industrial customers might use the projections in negotiating \nelectric -service agreements with the utility.21  But if the Commission agrees with this argument, \nthe appropriate remedy is to redact large-customer- related portions of the projections and release \nthe rest —not to treat the entire document as a trade secret.  \nFinally, ALLETE’s arguments about “context” are specious.  ALLETE has had ample \nopportunity to provide context for the projections and has done so both through its public responses \nto the discovery requests at issue and in live testimony.  The OAG would support providing additional context by publicly releasing the hearing transcript in which ALLETE’s witness \nexplains the projections.\n22  But the mere fact that ALLETE may be embarrassed or inconvenienced \nby the release of this information is not grounds to hide it from the public.  On the contrary, withholding it deprives the public of important context on a matter of great concern to Minnesota \nPower’s ratepayers , northern Minnesota, and the state as a whole. \nDated:  August 4, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \n \nKEITH ELLISON  \nAttorney General  \nState of Minnesota \n \n/s/ Peter G.

PAUL, MINNESOTA 55101- 2147 \n \nKatie Sieben  \nJoseph Sullivan \nHwikwon Ham  \nAudrey Partridge  \nJohn Tuma  Chair  \nVice Chair  \nCommissioner  \nCommissioner  \nCommissioner  \n \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota \nPower for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners  Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 \n \nINITIAL COMMENTS AND  \nARGUMENTS AND EXCEPTIONS  \nOF THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT  \nOF COMMERCE  \n \nAlthough the  Minnesota Department  of Commerce appreciates the Administrative Law \nJudge’s  thorough record review , the Public Utilities Commission  should reject the report’s \nconclusion.1 Following the evidentiary hearing, Petitioners  made new commitments memorialized \nin their July 11 settlement stipulation  with the Department.2 These commitments  sufficiently \nrespond to concerns  discussed in the report . Among other provisions, the stipulation contains a n \nequity capital commitment, makes a unique  clean -firm technology investment, provides \nmeaningful ratepayer financial benefits , enhances  service- quality standards, and improves \ngovernance provisions . Subject to these agreed -upon commitments, the  Department respectfully \nrecommends that the Commission approve the proposed a cquisition  as consistent with the public \ninterest .3 \n \n1 FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND RECOMMENDATION AND ADDENDUM  (July 17, \n2025) (eDocket No. 20257- 221020- 01). \n2 Settlement Stipulation  of the Department of Commerce, ALLETE d/b/a Minnesota Power, \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPPIB”), and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257- 220879- 01).  \n3 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd. 1.  \n2 ARGUMENT  \n To approve the acquisition, the Commission must  find that a preponderance of the  evidence \nestablishes the acquisition is consistent with  the public interest .4 This standard means  that it is \nmore likely than not that the acquisition’s possible benefits equal or outweigh the possible harm.5 \nThe Administrative Law Judge ’s report  identified concerns relating to ALLETE’s long -term \nfinancial health , clean energy transition, rate increases , service quality, and governance.6 The \nreport, however, did not expressly address the new  commitments memorialized in the stipulation. \nThese added  commitments are sufficient ly beneficial to make t he acquisition consistent with  the \npublic interest .7 The Commission should approve the a cquisition subject to these agreed -upon \ncommitments  as discussed below and in the  jointly proposed redlines to  section III(C) of the \nreport .8  \nI. THE STIPULATION PROVIDES MATERIAL , ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENTS .  \nThe Administrative Law Judge  expressed concern that Petitioners offer ed an insufficient \nvolume of  clearly enforceable affirmative benefits  as a counterbalance to potential risks posed by \nthe acquisition .9 But, as acknowledged in her report, the Administrative Law Judge  did not have \nan opportunity to expressly address  requirements  memorialized in the stipulation  that create new \nmaterial benefits  or are structured to be directly enforceable against the regulated utility.  \nThe stipulation creates meaningful benefits that do not simply restate existing legal \nobligations . The stipulation requires ALLETE to reduce its return on equity by 13 basis points and \n \n4 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd. 1 (2024) ; Minn. R. 1400.7300, subp. 5.  \n5 Id.; City of Lake Elmo v. Metro. Council , 685 N.W.2d 1, 4 (Minn. 2004).  \n6 Report , Findings of Fact  ¶¶ 179 -80, 187, 211, 228, 266. \n7 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd. 1 (2024) . \n8 See Petitioners’ Arguments & Exceptions, Attach.  B – Joint Redlines to ALJ Report Section \nIII(C) (Aug. 4, 2025).  \n9 Report , Findings of Fact  ¶¶ 135, 179- 80. \n3 waive its right to file a general rate case this year or anytime before  November 1, 2026.10 It also \nrequires Petitioners to contribute $50 million to a  non-recoverable clean firm technology fund.11 \nThe stipulation further includes provisions that will enhance service quality reporting and penalties \nfor noncompliance.12 In short, m any provisions will provide significant and near -term benefits to \nratepayer s or will help facilitate ALLETE’s energy transition.  \nBeyond creating meaningful new benefits, t he stipulation also  is structured to make \nprovisions directly enforceable against the regulated utility where appropriate . For example, the \nCommission can bar dividend payments unless Petitioners demonstrate that they  have complied  \nwith their five -year capital commitment.13 This provision (in the unlikely circumstances it became \nnecessary for the Commission to exercise it) would effectively slow ALLETE’s dividend growth \nrate. Some intervenors made functionally the same recommend ation to address ALLETE’s capital \nneeds : ALLETE should slow its dividend growth  rate and use the retained earnings to help fund \nits energy transition.14 The clean firm technology fund provision likewise requires ALLETE to \ncreate a regulatory liability that could be recovered in a future ratemaking proceeding to the extent \nthat Petitioners failed to make required contributions.15 The new service quality provisions  also \nare directly enforceable against ALLETE.16 \n In sum, the stipulation responds to concerns identified by the report about the significance \nand enforceability of ratepayer  benefits offered by Petitioners. Accordingly, the Department \nrecommends that the Commission adopt the following proposed finding:  \n \n10 See, e.g., Stipulation ¶¶ 1.14 (return on equity reduction), 1.43 (rate case stay- out). \n11 Id. ¶ 1.63 (non- recoverable clean firm tech fund).  \n12 Id. ¶ 1.64 (enhanced service quality reporting and enforcement).  \n13 Id. ¶ 1.4- 1.5.  \n14 See, e.g., Ex. OAG- 400 at 25 (Lebens Direct).  \n15 Stipulation ¶1.63.  \n16 Id. ¶ 1.64.  \n4 180a. After the evidentiary hearing, Petitioners and the Department \nexecuted  a stipulation in which Petitioners agreed to  about 30 new \nterms  relating to  capital, governance, ratepayer benefits, service \nquality, and enforceability. Given these commitments, the \nstipulation is sufficiently responsive to concerns raised by the \nAdministrative Law Judge and Intervenors regarding the adequacy \nand enforceability of commitments initially offered by the \nPetitioners. The s tipulation creates significant, material \ncommitments that are largely enforceable against the regulated utility. These commitments will provide meaningful financial and service quality benefits to Minnesota Power ’s ratepayers and \nsupport investments in the utility’s clean energy transition. In this \nway, the s tipulation is sufficient to make the a cquisition consistent \nwith the public interest with respect to material benefits and enforceability.  \n \nII. T\nHE STIPULATION HELP S PROTECT ALLETE’ S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL HEALTH . \nThe report expresses concern that the Partners could cause excess indebtedness or \notherwise  harm ALLETE’s creditworthiness.17 The stipulation, however, includes numerous \nprovisions intended to monitor ALLETE’s financial health and limit distributions that c ould \nadversely impact ALLETE’s credit rating .  \nThe stipulation memorializes commitments intended to monitor and protect ALLETE’s \nlong- term financial health : \n• It prohibits ALLETE from making any dividend or distributions to Alloy Parent \nunless at least one senior unsecured credit rating is investment grade or above.18  \n \n• It prohibits Petitioners from using utility assets as collateral for debts incurred by \nAlloy Parent or the Partners.19  \n \n• It prohibits ALLETE from loaning or borrowing funds from Alloy Parent entities, \nthe Partners, or the Partners’ other subsidiaries in effort to insulate ALLETE from \na parent bankruptcy.20  \n \n \n17 Report , Finding of Fact  ¶ 211. \n18 Stipulation ¶  1.6. \n19 Id. ¶ 1.16- 1.17.  \n20 Id. ¶ 1.21.  \n5 • It prohibits ALLETE from guaranteeing nonutility affiliate obligations .21  \n \n• It requires  Petitioners to obtain and file a non- consolidation opinion helping ensure \nthat ALLETE will not be subject to substantive consolidation with a parent or \naffiliate’s bankruptcy estate.22  \n \n• It limits  ALLETE’s ability to make dividend payments or distributions to Alloy \nParent unless it maintains an investment grade credit rating.23  \n \n• It requires ALLETE to make commercially reasonable efforts to remain rated by at \nleast two credit rating agencies .24 \n \n• It prohibits ALLETE from opting out of being rated by a  rating s agency.25  \n \nCollectively, these terms should help ensure that the Commission retains sufficient oversight into \nALLETE’s indebtedness and corporate distributions . It also should help alleviate concerns about \na parent or affiliate bankruptcy enveloping the regulated utility.  \nGiven these commitments, the Department proposes that the Commission adopt the \nfollowing finding:  \n221a. The stipulation is responsive to concerns identified by the \nAdministrative Law Judge and Intervenors pertaining to \nindebtedness and creditworthiness. The agreement limits dividend or distribution payments by ALLETE to Alloy Parent or the Partners when the regulated utility’s credit rating is less than credit grade,  it \nplaces limitations on direct credit support as well as cross default \nloan provisions. These additional protections, along with the non-consolidation opinion requirement , will help ensure that ALLETE \nis protected from excessive indebtedness or a bankruptcy elsewhere \nin Petitioners’ corporate structures. The commitments ensure that \nthe acquisition ’s impacts on ALLETE’s long -term financial health \nare consistent with the public interest.  \n \n \n21 Id. ¶ 1.22.  \n22 Id. ¶ 1.20.  \n23 Id. ¶ 1.9.  \n24 Id. \n25 Id.  \n6 III. THE STIPULATION IS RESPONSIVE TO CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT RISKS TO ALLETE’ S \nENERGY TRANSITION . \nThe report concludes that the transaction might  negatively  affect  ALLETE’s energy \ntransition .26 The stipulation, however, includes a  capital commitment and a unique investment in \nclean firm technology to facilitate ALLETE’s energy transition.   \nThe stipulation responds to concerns that the Partners may not provide sufficient capital to \nfinance ALLETE’s energy transition. Under the stipulation, as discussed above, the Commission \nmay bar dividend payments unless Petitioners demonstrate ongoing compliance with their five -\nyear capital commitment.27 This provision will create strong incentives for the Partners to deliver \non their capital obligations  to ALLETE. The stipulation also requires  Petitioners to contribute $50 \nmillion in investor capital for clean -firm technology investments  approved by the Commission.28 \nImportantly, this $50 million fund will not be recoverable from Minnesota ratepayers, defray ing \nenergy transition project costs .  \nConsidering these new commitments , the Commission should adopt the following \nproposed finding:  \n187a. The stipulation adequately responds to concerns identified by the \nAdministrative Law Judge and Intervenors relating to ALLETE’s \nclean energy transition. The s tipulation inc ludes a  reasonably \nenforceable five-year capital commitment that provides greater \nassurances that Alloy Parent  will finance ALLETE’s energy \ntransition . It also requires Petitioners to  create a $50 million clean \nfirm technology investment fund to finance needed projects at no \ncost to Minnesota ratepayers. These changes , memorialized in the \nstipulation,  are sufficient to make t he acquisition consistent with the \npublic interest with respect to ALLETE’s clean energy transition . \n \n \n26 Report , Finding of Fact  ¶ 187. \n27 Stipulation  ¶¶ 1.4- 1.5.  \n28 Id. ¶ 1.63.  \n7 IV. THE STIPULATION RESPONDS TO CONCERNS ABOUT ADVERSE RATEPAYER IMPACTS . \n The report identifies as a potential risk that Petitioners will pursue rate increases that could \nnegatively impact ALLETE’s customers.29 It also posits that the Partners could detrimentally \nimpact ALLETE’s service quality.30 To mitigate these concerns, the stipulation includes \nprovisions responsive to both issues. \nA. The Stipulation Provides Customers with Financial Benefits.  \n The stipulation provides several meaningful financial benefits for ALLETE’s regulated \nutility customers in Minnesota. First, the stipulation requires Minnesota Power to waive its right \nto file a rate case before November 1, 2026.31 This provision almost certainly will deliver financial \nbenefits for customers. In ALLETE’s last four  rate cases, it obtained sizeable interim rate increases  \nas shown in the table below : \nRate Case Docket  Interim Rate Increase  Total Request  \nE-015/GR -16-664 $34.6 million (5.6%)  $55.1 million (9.1%)32 \nE-015/GR -19-442 $36.1 million (5.8%)  $65.9 million (10.6%)33 \nE-015/GR -21-335 $87.3 million (14.23%)34 $108.3 million (17.6%)35 \nE-015/GR -23-155 $102.6 million (13.8%)  $127.9 million (17.25)36 \n \n \n29 Report , Finding of Fact  ¶ 222. \n30 Id., Finding of Fact  ¶ 228. \n31 Stipulation ¶ 1.43.  \n32 In re Minn.

In re \nMinn. Power’s Appl. for Auth. to Increate Rates for Elec. Serv. in Minn., Docket No. E -015/GR -\n21-335, ORDER SETTING INTERIM RATES  at 4-5 (Dec. 30, 2021) (eDocket No. 202112- 181086- 03). \n35 Id. \n36 In re Minn. Power’s Appl. for Auth. to Increate Rates for Elec. Serv. in Minn., Docket No. E -\n015/GR -23-155, ORDER SETTING INTERIM RATES  at 1, 3 (Dec. 19, 2023) (eDocket No. 202112-\n181086- 03). \n8 While a one- year rate case stay -out’s exact value depends on the size  of the  utility’s claimed \nrevenue deficiency and the final rates ultimately approved by the Commission, experience suggests \nthat the stay -out will be meaningful .  \nSecond, the stipulation requires ALLETE  to reduce its authorized  return on equity (“ROE”) \nby 13 basis points  from 9.78% to 9.65% , and adjust its rates the month after the acquisition closes \nand the Commission’s approval order  becomes final.37 For perspective , a single basis point was  \nannually worth about $182,000 during ALLETE’s last rate case.38 ALLETE’s ROE would remain \nfixed  until the Commission set final rates in a future rate case, which would likely take ten to \nthirteen months to resolve .39 As a result, assuming a November 2026 rate case filing, customers \nwould likely benefit from the ROE reduction until late 2027 or early 2028. \nThird, the stipulation requires ALLETE to  prompt ly return land-sale revenues owed to \ncustomers.40 Since October 2021, ALLETE has sold about  $75.4 million worth  of land that was \npreviously i ncluded i n utility rate base.41 The stipulation requires ALLETE to begin timely \nreturning these funds to customers.42 While these revenues were always owed back to customers, \nthe stipulation ensures that customers no longer lose the time value of their money by having \nALLETE indefinitely hold it . In addition, the stipulation creates a process for timely returning  \n \n37 Stipulation ¶ 1.14.  \n38 In re Minn. Power’s Appl. for Auth. to Increate Rates for Elec.

The Stipulation Enhances  Service Quality Protections.  \nBesides providing new financial benefits, the stipulation requires ALLETE to meet more \nstringent service quality standards relating to reliability, customer complaint  volume, cold weather \nrule compliance,  service restoration for involuntarily disconnected customers, call answer times, \nand customer bill accuracy.44 If ALLETE fails to meet these standards, following an \nimplementation period, the utility will need to  make  non-recoverable $250,000 underperformance \npayments.45 This, again, will encourage ALLETE to ensure that its service quality remains strong.  \nGiven these commitments, the Department recommends  that the Commission adopt the \nfollowing proposed findings : \n222a. The stipulation is sufficiently responsive to concerns raised by the \nAdministrative Law Judge and Intervenors regarding ratepayer  \nfinancial harm risks . The s tipulation requires ALLETE to reduce its \nregulated ROE by 13 basis points for ratemaking purposes and \nwaive its right to file a rate case until November 1, 2026. It also \nrequires ALLETE to begin refunding $74.5 million in prior land-\nsale revenues to customers. These requirements, memorialized in the stipulation, will provide customers with sufficient financial \nbenefits such that  the acquisition  is consistent with the public \ninterest.   \n228a. The stipulation contains new reporting and penalty requirements \nthat will incentivize Petitioners to protect the quality of service provided to customers . In particular, the s tipulation requires \nALLETE to meet service quality standards relating to reliability, \ncustomer compl aint volume, cold weather rule compliance, service \nrestoration for involuntarily disconnected customers, call answer \ntimes, and customer bill accuracy.  If ALLETE fails to meet the \nstandards set in the s tipulation, the utility must make a non-\nrecoverable $250,000 underperformance payment  for each \nviolation. These requirements, memorialized in the s tipulation, will \n \n43 Id. ¶ 1.46.  \n44 Id. ¶ 1.64.  \n45 Id. \n10 sufficiently protect service quality render ing the acquisition  \nconsistent with the public interest.  \n \nV. THE STIPULATION IMPROVES  ALLETE’ S PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED POST-ACQUISITION \nGOVERNANCE  STRUCTURE . \n The report concludes that the proposed governance structure fail s to adequately balance \nowners, ratepayers, and community needs and interests .46 But the  stipulation includes material \nchanges responsive to these governance  concerns.  \nThe stipulation requires Petitioners to make improvements to ALLETE’s contemplated \npost-acquisition  governance structure. The stipulation requires Petitioners to create a fourteen -\nmember board for ALLETE.47 The Partners will select ten directors based on their respective \nownership interests.48 The Partners will select another  three directors by agreement.49 And \nALLETE’s CEO will be t he final director.50 Of the thirteen non- CEO directors, six must  meet the \nNew York Stock Exchange’s  independence definition. T he Partners will appoint the remaining \nseven directors to represent their respective interests consistent with their fiduciary obligations to \nALLETE under Minnesota law.51 In sum, there will be seven Partner directors and seven  directors \nnot employed by GIP or CPPIB, six of whom will meet a formal independence definition. The \nstipulation further requires  that a majority of independent directors vote to place ALLETE into \nvoluntary bankruptcy.52 \nThese changes are material  improvement s relative to Petitioners’ original proposal  that the \nAdministrative Law Judge  reviewed . These unaffiliated directors will provide an  independent \n \n46 Report , Finding of Fact  ¶ 266. \n47 Stipulation  ¶ 1.23(b). \n48 Id. ¶ 1.23(b)(vi).  \n49 Id. \n50 Id. \n51 Id. ¶¶ 1.23(b)(i), 1.25; Ex.

They will help protect ALLETE’s long- term value by helping to \nensure board decisions are made on the merits, rather than on extraneous considerations such as \nshort -term financial performance. They also will bring greater objectivity and neutrality to \nmanagement decisions. Additionally, the bankruptcy provision will provide more protection  \nagainst any effort to liquidate assets used to provide  regulated utility service .  \nGiven the stipulation’s timing, the Administrative Law Judge  did not have an opportunity \nto meaningfully consider or expressly address the benefits of these governance changes. Given \nthese changed circumstances, the Department respectfully requests that the Commission adopt the following proposed finding:  \n266a . The stipulation is sufficiently responsive to governance concerns \nidentified by the Administrative Law Judge and Intervenors. The \nstipulation creates a better balance between independent and Partner \ndirectors on ALLETE’s post -acquisition board than originally \nproposed. It also enhances existing bankruptcy- related protections  \nby requiring a majority of independent directors to vote to place ALLETE into voluntary bankruptcy. Given these changes, the stipulation sufficiently improves  ALLETE’s post-acquisition \ngovernance such that  the transaction  is consistent with the public \ninterest.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n The Department appreciates the Administrative Law Judge’s comprehensive review of the \nevidentiary record.  Because the s tipulation was only finalized two business days before the report \nwas due, the Administrative Law Judge did not have an opportunity to review it in great detail or \nsubstantively address it. Because the s tipulation is broadly responsive to many key concerns  \n   \n12 discussed in the report, the Commission should find that the a cquisition is consistent with the \npublic interest subject to the agreed-upon conditions.  \nDated:   August 4, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \n \nKEITH ELLISON  \nState of Minnesota \nAttorney General  \n   \n/s/ Richard Dornfeld   \nRICHARD DORNFELD  \nAssistant Attorney General Attorney Reg.

    "content": "Comments from Operating Engineers Local 49  \nand North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters  \n \n \nAugust 4 , 2025  \n \nMr. Mike Bull  \nActing Executive Secretary  \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission  \n121 7th Place East, Suite 350  \nSt. Paul, MN 55101  \n \n \nRe: Letter of Support – Docket No. PA-24-198 – Acquisition of ALLETE by Can ada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners  \n \n \n \nDear Commissioners,  \n \nOn behalf of the Internation al Union of Operating Engineers Local 49  and the North Central States \nRegional Council of Carpenters , which represent  over 25,000  members across Minnesota, we fully  \nsupport the ALJ (Administrative Law Judge) report and its recommendations for the settlement regarding \nthe acquisition  of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners .  \n \nWe believe the ALJ ’s report  accurately reflects the consensus among stakeholders that the settlement and \nacquisition represent significant benefits for Minnesota workers, customers, and local communities, \nparticularly in terms of job security, investment in local infrastructure, and  workforce stability.  Our \nunions concur with the ALJ’s recommendation that the settlement and acquisition are consistent with the \npublic interest, echoing findings from the Department of Commerce and other parties who reviewed  the \ntransaction to ensur e continued secure  investment, sustained affordable energy , and assistance with \ndriving clean energy initiatives.   \n \nThe buyers , CPP Investments and GIP , have publicly committed to honoring existing workforce \nagreements, keeping ALLETE  locally managed, maintaining high labor standards, and collaborating on \nfuture infrastructure needs to support both reliability and decarbonization . This commitment respects  \nexisting workforce agreements, maintain s high labor standards, and work s collaboratively to address \nMinnesota’s future energy and infrastructure needs.  Based on th e direction the owners plan to take this \nacquisition,  we anticipate  positive impacts for jobs, workforce stability, and local surrounding \ncommunities.  This deal will continue to uphold commitments to a union workforce, safe workplaces and \ninvestment in local infrastructure as Minnesota continues to pursue an ambitious clean energy  and grid \nmodernization goal.  \n \nThis acquisition will also facilitate immediate savings and significant benefits to Minnesota Power ’s \ncustomers and communities. With the inclusion of a rate freeze and forgiveness program, i t is consistent \nwith the public interest according to the DOC and many stakeholders . This approval of the transaction is \nnecessary to secure the capital and experienced ownership required for Minnesota Power to maintain its \nservice commitments and support robust regional economic activity . \n \nIn summary , both the Carpenters and Operating Engineers Local 49 urge the Minnesota Public Utilities \nCommission to accept the ALJ’s recommendations and approve the ALJ’s recommendation s and the \nDOC settlement, emphasizing the broader value to Minnesota’s workforce, electric reliability, and \naffordability. We urge the PUC to approve the transaction as being in the public interest and beneficial for \nMinnesota workers and communities . \n \n Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require further information.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nRichard Kolodziejski , Director of Government Affairs , North Central States Regional Council of \nCarpenters  \n \nNathan Runke, Regulatory and Political Affairs Coordinator, International Union of Operating Engineers \nLocal 49"

The ALJ Report finds that the proposed acquisition (“Acquisition”) of ALLETE, Inc., parent company of Minnesota Power, by Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP”) is not in the public interest,\n1 and therefore recommends that the Commission disapprove the proposed Acquisition.2  \nSierra Club fully supports the ALJ Report and its recommendations. The ALJ Report’s \nfindings are accurate and well -supported by the evidentiary record, amply demonstrating that the \nAcquisition’s alleged benefits are unproven, and that its risks and harms outweigh the alleged benefits, resulting in net harms.\n3 The evidence shows that the Acquisition does not guarantee \naccess to capital,  is likely to contribute to dramatically higher rates,  may threaten Minnesota Power’s compliance with the Carbon Free Standard, and would result in a loss of local control and reduced transparency. Because of these net harms, the ALJ Report correctly concludes that the Acquisition is not consistent with the public interest under Minn. Stat. §216B.50.\n4 The ALJ’s \nfindings are consistent with Minn. Stat. §216B.50 and all other applicable statutes and rules. The Commission should adopt the ALJ Report in full, with no modifications.  \nOn July 11, 2025, ALLETE, GIP, CPP, and the Minnesota Department of Commerce \nfiled a Proposed Settlement which does not mitigate the net harms associated with the Acquisition. The ALJ Report correctly finds that the Proposed Settlement does not make the \n \n1 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Administrative Law Judge’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of \nLaw, and Recommendations (July 15, 2025) (hereinafter “ALJ Report”) at 3, 61 ¶ 15, 66. \n2 Id. at 3, 62 ¶ 1, 67. \n3  Id. at 61 ¶¶ 15−17, 65, 66. \n4 Id. at 3, 61 ¶ 15, 66. \n \n2 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Acquisition consistent with the public interest or tip the balance in favor of approval.5 Sierra \nClub’s comments on the Proposed Settlement are provided in a separate, concurrent filing. \nThe ALJ’s factual findings are fully supported by the evidence and its legal conclusions \nand recommendations are sound. Because the record shows that the Acquisition is not consistent \nwith the public interest, Sierra Club respectfully urges the Commission to adopt the ALJ Report in full, follow the report’s recommendation, and deny the proposed Acquisition.  \nDated: August 4, 2025          Respectfully submitted, \n        \n___/s/ Patrick Woolsey ______________ \n \nPatrick Woolsey (Pro hac vice) Kristin Henry (Pro hac vice) \nSierra Club Environmental Law Program \n2101 Webster Street Suite 1300 \nOakland, CA  94612 \n(415) 977-5757 \npatrick.woolsey@sierraclub.org \nkristin.henry@sierraclub.org \n \nEvan Mulholland \nMinnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy \n1919 University Ave. W #515 \nSt. Paul, MN 55104 \n(651) 223-5969 \nemulholland@mncenter.org \n \nAttorneys for Sierra Club \n \n \n5 Id. at 67, fn. 549."

The Commission has asked parties to address whether the Proposed Settlement is “consistent with the public interest within the meaning of Minn. Stat. § 216B.50” and whether the Proposed Settlement adequately addresses the issues identified in the Commission’s October 7, 2024 order.  \nThe answer to both questions is no. The evidence in this proceeding—including an \nextensive hearing record, ample witness testimony, and Petitioners’ own statements—shows that the proposed Acquisition of ALLETE (“Acquisition”) by GIP and CPP (together, the “Partners”) presents significant risks to Minnesota Power ratepayers and few, if any, benefits : it may threaten \nMinnesota Power’s compliance with the Carbon Free Standard,  it does not guarantee access to \ncapital,  it is likely to contribute to dramatically higher rates,  and it would result in a loss of local \ncontrol and reduced transparency. The Administrative Law Judge’s comprehensive and well-supported final report (“ALJ Report”) correctly concluded that the Acquisition is not in the public interest\n1 and recommended that the Commission disapprove it.2  \nThe Proposed Settlement does nothing to change this conclusion. It largely consists of \ncommitments Petitioners already proposed in testimony, many of which simply describe the status quo or restate existing law rather than offering any affirmative benefit. The few new provisions in the Proposed Settlement are nowhere near sufficient to outweigh the Acquisition’s \n \n1 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Administrative Law Judge’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of \nLaw, and Recommendations (July 15, 2025) (hereinafter “ALJ Report”) at 3, 61 ¶ 15, 66. \n2 Id. at 3, 62 ¶ 1, 67. \n \n2 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n substantial, well-documented risks. The Proposed Settlement’s additional provisions still do not \nguarantee access to capital, still do not protect ratepayers from the risk of outsize rate increases, and still do not ensure the Company complies with the Carbon Free Standard. While the Proposed Settlement promises that Alloy Parent will finance a $50 million “Clean Firm Technology Fund,” this is dwarfed by the scale of the Company’s capital plans, and there is no guarantee this fund would be used for fully carbon-free technologies. Finally, the Proposed Settlement would not mitigate the risks of Partner control of the Board or provide transparency into the Partners’ finances. The ALJ Report correctly found that the Proposed Settlement does not render the Acquisition in the public interest or tip the balance in favor of approval.\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC \nINTEREST. \nUnder Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd. 1.3, Petitioners bear the burden of proof to show that \nthe Acquisition is consistent with the public interest.4 The parties disagree about whether this \nstandard requires a showing of affirmative public benefit, as Sierra Club and other intervenors \nhave established,5 or merely a showing of no net harm, as Petitioners contend. But the ALJ \nReport correctly finds that “[t]he proposed deal is inconsistent with the public interest under \neither standard because it results in net harm to the public interest.”6 \n \n3 Id. at 67, fn. 549. \n4 Id. at 3; In the Matter of a Petition by N. States Power Co. for Approval of the Acquisition of \nthe Mankato Energy Ctr., Docket No. E-002/PA-18-702, Order Denying Petition and Requiring \nSupplemental Modeling, 9 (Minn. Pub. Util. Comm’n Dec. 18, 2019). \n5 See Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Sierra Club’s Initial Post-Hearing Brief, Public – Redacted \n(May 1, 2025) (hereinafter “Sierra Club Opening Br.”) at 11−13; Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, \nSierra Club’s Reply Brief, Public – Redacted (May 29, 2025) (hereinafter “Sierra Club Reply \nBr.”) at 2−3. \n6 ALJ Report at 61 ¶ 15 (emphasis added). \n \n3 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Sierra Club and other intervenors in this proceeding have presented extensive evidence \nshowing that the proposed Acquisition of ALLETE by the Partners would provide few or no \nbenefits to ratepayers and poses extensive harms and risks: it may threaten Minnesota Power’s compliance with the Carbon Free Standard,\n7 does not guarantee access to capital,8 is likely to \ncontribute to dramatically higher rates,9 and would result in loss of local control10 and reduced \ntransparency.11  In light of this evidence, the ALJ Report correctly concludes that “the proposed \nAcquisition is not in the public interest” because “[a]bsent any speculation . . . the documentary evidence shows this transaction carries real and significant costs and risks to Minnesota ratepayers and few, if any, benefits.”\n12  \nThe Proposed Settlement does not change this conclusion: it does not mitigate the risks of \nthe Acquisition and does not provide any benefits sufficient to outweigh the Acquisition’s harms. The ALJ Report found that “concerns regarding the acquisition have not been resolved” by the Proposed Settlement and that “it does not change the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation to disapprove the Acquisition.”\n13 While the Proposed Settlement contains \nvarious conditions which purport to offer benefits or to mitigate the risks of the Acquisition, almost none of these provisions offer real benefits or meaningful protections.  \nFirst, most of the provisions in the Proposed Settlement are not new—they simply \nreiterate provisions that the Petitioners already proposed in their application or in their testimony \n \n7 See Sierra Club Opening Br. at 14−21; Sierra Club Reply Br. at 4−9. \n8 See Sierra Club Opening Br. at 22−25; Sierra Club Reply Br. at 10−13. \n9 See Sierra Club Opening Br. at 26−32; Sierra Club Reply Br. at 14−17. \n10 See Sierra Club Opening Br. at 32−34; Sierra Club Reply Br. at 18−19. \n11 See Sierra Club Opening Br. at 35−37; Sierra Club Reply Br. at 20−21. \n12 ALJ Report at 66. \n13 Id. at 67, fn. 549. \n \n4 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n in this proceeding, either repeating them verbatim or with slight variations.14 Based on the record \nevidence, the Administrative Law Judge has already reviewed these provisions and found th at \nthey “do not rebalance the transaction to avoid net harm” and do not make the Acquisition \nconsistent with the public interest.15  \nSecond, many of the conditions in the Proposed Settlement consist of unenforceable \nstatements of intention, descriptions of the current status quo, or restatements of existing legal requirements, and therefore do not offer any benefits.\n16 Third, to the extent that the Proposed \nSettlement purports to protect against the risks of the Acquisition, this is not an affirmative benefit, but rather attempted mitigation for harms that would not occur absent the Acquisition.\n17 \nFinally, few of the Proposed Settlement’s conditions apply to the Partners, who would \nown ALLETE after the Acquisition. The ALJ Report correctly observes that “[t]he Partners themselves have carefully committed to do very little, instead largely making commitments through expected holding companies or Minnesota Power itself.”\n18 This fatally undermines many \n \n14 See Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Settlement Stipulation Between the Minnesota Department \nof Commerce, ALLETE, Inc. D/B/A Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, \nand Global Infrastructure Partners (July 11, 2025) (hereinafter “Proposed Settlement”) at 2, fn. 3. \n15 ALJ Report at 61 ¶ 17. \n16 See id. at 32 ¶ 155 (“Commitments 19 and 21 do not reflect a change from the status quo and \nthus are not benefits of the Acquisition”), 34−35 (noting that Commitments 25, 28, 29, 30, 34, 35  “would maintain the status quo and thus [are] not a benefit of the proposed acquisition”), 35 \n(noting that Commitments 36−48 “promise to maintain the status quo and do not represent \naffirmative benefits”), 37 (Commitment 43 “simply reflects the status quo, not a benefit”), 38 \n(Commitment 48 “does not offer an affirmative benefit; it simply maintains the status quo”), 61 ¶ \n17 (“Many of the commitments simply restate existing legal requirements and therefore do not \nprovide additional protections to counterbalance new risks arising as a result of the acquisition. \nSome of the proposed conditions may be unenforceable. And others offer little benefit to \nratepayers or the regulatory compact.”) \n17 See, e.g., id. at 36 (Commitments 40 and 41 “would not be necessary without the transaction \nand attempt to mitigate a loss of transparency rather than provide an affirmative benefit.”)  \n18 Id. at 66. \n \n5 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n of the Proposed Settlement’s provisions: a commitment by Alloy Parent—an entity controlled by \nthe Partners—is not worth much if the Partners themselves are not bound by that commitment.  \nThe ALJ Report correctly concludes that “[t]he commitments offered by Petitioners, \nlargely in attempt to mitigate the risks of the proposed acquisition, offer few affirmative benefits,” “do not provide new or additional benefits sufficient to counterbalance new risks arising as a result of the acquisition,” and “are largely unenforceable by the Commission.”\n19 In \nshort, the Proposed Settlement does not render the Acquisition consistent with the public interest. \nA. Petitioners Have Failed to Support Their Claimed Justification for the \nAcquisition. \n \nAs a threshold matter, Petitioners have not proven that Minnesota Power needs the \nAcquisition in order to obtain sufficient capital to fund its 5-year plan.20 The ALJ Report noted \nthat “[i]ntervenors identified multiple ways ALLETE could reduce or mitigate its capital needs,” \nand concluded that “ALLETE’s capital need projections are likely overstated.”21 The ALJ Report \nfinds that “ALLETE has historically been able to meet its capital needs through the public markets” and that “ALLETE has not established that there is a significant risk that the public markets will be unable to meet its probable capital needs.”\n22 These findings negate the Company’s claims that \nthe proposed Acquisition is justified by an alleged inability to obtain capital in public markets. \n \n19 Id. at 38 ¶ 179. \n20 See id. at 28 ¶ 141 (noting that “ALLETE recently advised investors that it could adequately \nmeet its capital needs for this same five-year period in the public markets,” without the \nAcquisition). \n21 Id. at 23 ¶ 124, 24 ¶ 128. \n22 Id. at 27 ¶ 135; see also id. 25, ¶¶ 131−132. \n \n6 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n B. The Proposed Settlement Does Not Ensure Improved Access to Capital. \n \nEven if the Company had shown a need to obtain capital outside of public markets, which \nit has not done, the Proposed Settlement does not guarantee that the Partners will provide short-\nterm or long-term capital to ALLETE. Proposed Settlement Condition 1.3 calls for Alloy Parent to provide equity financing sufficient to find Minnesota Power’s 5-year capital plan, repeating the same language previously offered by Petitioners in Rebuttal testimony.\n23 This condition does not \nguarantee improved access to capital. \nFirst, the ALJ Report correctly notes that “the Commitment is on behalf of Alloy Parent, \nnot the Partners,” and that while “[t]he Partners would have an indirect ownership interest in Alloy Parent, . . . they have not committed to hold that interest for any period, nor has Alloy Parent \ncommitted to hold ALLETE for any period.”\n24 The ALJ Report accurately concludes that “the \nPartners have not, in fact, promised to provide capital to ALLETE” because: \n \n[T]he Partners have not promised an infusion of their equity to fund the plan; they have \nonly committed that Alloy Parent will provide funding. A commitment by Alloy Parent is \nnot the same thing as a commitment by the Partners. There is no guarantee that the \nPartners will provide capital to Alloy Parent . . .”25 \n \nCritically, “the Commission lacks authority to force the Partners to . . . provid[e] capital to \nMinnesota Power.”26 Moreover, the ALJ Report explains that “nothing in the Commitment \nprevents ALLETE from borrowing the funds for any equity infusions”27 and “[t]here is no \nguarantee that . . . Alloy Parent will not fulfill its obligation to ALLETE through debt or other \n \n23 Proposed Settlement at 2−3, ¶ 1.3; Ex. MP-27 Schedule 1 at 1 (Cady Rebuttal). \n24 ALJ Report at 28. \n25 Id. at 66 (emphasis added). \n26 Id. at 67. \n27 Id. at 28−29 ¶ 141. \n \n7 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n mechanisms,” rather than via capital infusions from the Partners.28 Finally, a promise by Alloy \nParent to finance the Company’s 5-year plan does not ensure longer-term access to capital, as the \nALJ correctly notes: “[A] five-year capital commitment cannot alone fund Minnesota Power’s \nefforts to achieve the energy transition because that transition will extend beyond five years.”29 \n \nThe Proposed Settlement does not mitigate the risk that the Partners may fail to provide \ncapital to ALLETE . Proposed Settlement Condition 1.4 would make dividend payments from \nALLETE to Alloy Parent contingent on Alloy Parent supplying equity capital to finance \nALLETE’s 5-year plan, while Condition 1.5 would require Minnesota Power to document this via a compliance filing in the Company’s capital structure docket.\n30 But these proposed conditions do \nnot remedy the essential flaws in the Petitioners’ proposal. These provisions apply only to the Company and Alloy Parent, not to the Partners. Condition 1.4 still does not require the Partners to provide equity capital to ALLETE or prevent Alloy Parent from relying on debt to finance the 5-year plan. And Conditions 1.4 and 1.5 do nothing to secure the Company’s long-term access to capital because they apply only to Minnesota Power’s current 5-year plan and not beyond. \nC. The Proposed Settlement Does Not Protect Against Overspending or Rate \nIncreases. \n The Proposed Settlement does not limit future rate increases and does not mitigate the risk \nthat the Acquisition will lead to higher costs for customers. The ALJ Report correctly concludes \nthat “[t]he Acquisition creates an unacceptable risk of rate increase and rate shock.”\n31 The ALJ \n \n28 Id. at 66. \n29 Id. at 28 ¶ 141. \n30 Proposed Settlement at 3 ¶¶ 1.4, 1.5. \n31 ALJ Report at 46 ¶ 222. \n \n8 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n finds that “[t]he nonpublic evidence reveals the Partner’s intent to do what private equity is \nexpected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control,”32 and that  \n“the Partners’ targeted risk-adjusted return increases the risk of unsustainable rate hikes in the future.”\n33 The ALJ concludes that “the Partners are planning on significant rate increases” and \nfinds that “if permitted by the Commission, [these increases] would likely be detrimental to the economic competitiveness of ALLETE’s largest . . . customers, and would cause electricity costs to increase as a percentage of residential customer incomes.”\n34  \nThe Proposed Settlement does not mitigate the risk that the Acquisition will result in \noverspending or larger rate increases driven by the Partners’ desire to maximize profits. While the Proposed Settlement includes a commitment by the Company not to file a rate case before November 1, 2026,\n35 this promise should carry little weight. A commitment to delay a rate case \nfiling by slightly more than a year does not limit the size of the rate increase that the Company could seek in that case, or the size and frequency of increases it could request in subsequent cases. Ultimately, ratepayers would still likely experience large rate increases after the Acquisition. \n \nThe Proposed Settlement also includes a commitment to temporarily reduce Minnesota \nPower’s Return on Equity (“ROE”) from 9.78 percent to 9.65 percent until the Company’s next \nrate case.\n36 Again, this proposal accomplishes little. A temporary reduction of 0.13 percent in the \nCompany’s ROE that would likely apply only for one year until the Company’s November 2026 \n \n32 Id. at 66. \n33 Id. at 45 ¶ 214. \n34 Id. at 46 ¶ 222. \n35 Proposed Settlement at 9 ¶ 1.43. \n36 Id. at 4 ¶ 1.14. \n \n9 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n rate case filing will not prevent the Company from seeking an ROE increase in that case or limit \nthe size of that increase.37 \n \nFinally, the Proposed Settlement specifies that the Company cannot recover Acquisition \ntransaction costs, transition costs, or the Acquisition premium from via rate cases.38 This simply \nrepeats previous commitments already proposed in the Company’s rebuttal testimony in this case,\n39 which the ALJ Report correctly found are not ratepayer benefits. The ALJ concluded that \nthese commitments “would not provide affirmative benefits; they merely purport to prevent ratepayers from paying costs that would not have been incurred absent ALLETE’s decision to pursue a sale.”\n40 \nD. The Proposed Settlement Does Not Ensure a Clean Energy Transition or \nCompliance with the Carbon Free Standard. \nThe Proposed Settlement does not ensure the Company complies with the Carbon Free \nStandard, nor does it require the Partners to fund renewable energy projects. Alloy Parent’s promise to finance a new $50 million “Clean Firm Technology Fund” is dwarfed by the scale of \nthe Company’s capital plans and there is no guarantee it will be used for fully carbon-free technologies. \nThe ALJ Report correctly finds that Petitioners have not shown the Acquisition would help \nMinnesota Power comply with the Carbon Free Standard. Specifically, the ALJ concluded that “[t]he Petitioners did not prove by a preponderance of evidence that they will be unable to meet \n \n37 See id. (“Nothing in this settlement stipulation shall be considered a commitment (i) to any \nspecific ROE in the company’s next rate case or (ii) to use a specific methodology to determine \nthe ROE in the company’s next rate case.”) \n38 Id. at 9 ¶ 1.40. \n39 Ex. MP-27 Schedule 1 at 3 (Commitments 17 and 18) (Cady Rebuttal). \n40 ALJ Report at 32. \n \n10 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n the Carbon Free Standard absent the Acquisition, nor did they guarantee or present sufficient \nevidence showing that the standard will be met as a result of the Acquisition.”41 \n \nThe Proposed Settlement does nothing to change this conclusion. Petitioners do not offer \na binding commitment to achieve the Carbon Free Standard in the Proposed Settlement. Instead, \nthe Proposed Settlement states only that Petitioners will make “efforts to achieve Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard with least cost pathways to compliance ultimately determined by the Commission in IRP and related dockets.”\n42 This is exactly the same language that was included in \nthe Petitioners’ previous commitments in the Company’s rebuttal testimony.43 The ALJ Report \nrecognized the weakness of this language, noting that Petitioners’ promise to make “efforts to achieve” the Carbon Free Standard is not “a binding commitment to achieve the emissions reductions required under the Standard.”\n44 Moreover, the ALJ noted that like many of the \nPetitioners’ other commitments, the promise to comply with the Carbon Free Standard is simply a restatement of existing legal requirements that apply regardless of the transaction, and therefore not a benefit of the Acquisition.\n45 And as Sierra Club explained, the Carbon Free Standard contains \n“off-ramps” that could allow the Petitioners to seek exemptions from its requirements.46 \n \nIn addition, the Proposed Settlement does nothing to mitigate the risks that the Partners \nmay sell ALLETE before the Company retires the coal-fired Boswell Generating Station \n(“Boswell”) or achieves compliance with the Carbon Free Standard. The ALJ Report notes that \n \n41 Id. at 66. \n42 Proposed Settlement at 13 ¶ 1.71. \n43 Ex. MP-27 Schedule 1 at 7 ¶ 47 (Cady Rebuttal). \n44 ALJ Report at 39−40 ¶ 185. \n45 Id. at 37 ¶ 177. \n46 Sierra Club Opening Br. at 16; Sierra Club Reply Br. at 7. \n \n11 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n “the Partners have not committed to owning ALLETE for any period of time.”47 The ALJ finds \nthat the risk of the Partners selling ALLETE in the short term is “highly plausible.”48 The Proposed \nSettlement imposes no restrictions on the timing of the Partners’ sale of ALLETE. \nThe Proposed Settlement also does not mitigate the risk that the Partners may be unwilling \nto adequately fund renewable energy or may prioritize spending on fossil resources instead, or that \nthe Partners may seek Commission approval to postpone the retirement of Boswell. Regarding the former, the ALJ Report concluded: \nIntervenors have established significant risks that the Partners will be unwilling or unable \nto provide ALLETE sufficient capital to transition its regulated operations in Minnesota \nfrom fossil fuels to renewable energy. The deal presents a risk that the Partners may invest \ntoo much in new or existing fossil-fueled resources, or may not invest enough in lower-\ncost renewable resources, either of which could harm Minnesota Power’s ability to comply \nwith the Carbon Free Standard.\n49 \n \nThe Proposed Settlement does not ensure that the Partners will fund renewable energy. \nNeither the Partners nor Alloy Parent make any long-term commitments to provide capital for \nclean energy projects. The only new commitment related to clean energy in the Proposed Settlement is a promise that Alloy Parent (not the Partners) will finance a $50 million “Clean Firm Technology Fund.”\n50 Alloy Parent would pay $16.67 million installments into the fund every two \nyears for the next five years.51 The fund would be used to finance investments in “clean firm \ntechnology,” which Petitioners define as “carbon-free resource[s], as defined by Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 1(b), that can be dispatched and provide energy continuously for a duration of \n \n47 ALJ Report at 43 ¶ 204, see also id. at 28 ¶ 141. \n48 Id. at 44 ¶ 211. \n49 Id. at 40 ¶ 187; see also id. at ¶ 186 (“if ALLETE and Partners over-invest in gas-fired \ngeneration, this could jeopardize ALLETE’s transition to clean energy and place ratepayers at \nrisk of funding additional projects.”). \n50 Proposed Settlement at 11 ¶ 1.63 \n51 Id. \n \n12 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 50 hours or more.”52 Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 1(b) defines “carbon-free” as “a technology \nthat generates electricity without emitting carbon dioxide.”  \nNotably, however, the Proposed Settlement includes a loophole that expressly allows \nMinnesota Power to request exemptions in order to fund resources that do not meet the Company’s \nown definition of “clean firm technology.” The Proposed Settlement states that “[i]f Minnesota Power identifies an opportunity that may meet the intent of the Fund but does not fully satisfy the \naforementioned definition, it may propose the opportunity to the Commission after conferring with the Department to confirm that the Department does not object in principle.”\n53 \nThis loophole is particularly concerning because the definition of “carbon free” is currently \ndisputed. Minnesota Power and DOC have recently argued in another Commission docket \ninvolving implementation of Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard that thermal combustion resources that do emit carbon dioxide, including burning of municipal solid waste, biomass, or \nrenewable natural gas, should be considered fully or partially carbon-free if those fuels have lower net lifecycle carbon emissions than alternative fuels or alternative methods of waste disposal.\n54 \nThis interpretation is plainly inconsistent with the statutory definition of “carbon free” in Minn. \nStat. § 216B.1691, subd. 1(b), as the Clean Energy Organizations have explained via comments in \nthat Commission proceeding.55 \n \n52 Id. \n53 Proposed Settlement at 12 ¶ 1.63 (emphasis added). \n54 See Docket No. E-999/CI-24-352, Comments of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and \nthe Minnesota Department of Commerce, 18 (Minn.

But even if there were no dispute \nabout the statutory definition of “carbon free,” the loophole in the Proposed Settlement could allow the “Clean Firm Technology Fund” to be used to finance resources that do not meet that definition. \nMoreover, even if the “Clean Firm Technology Fund” were limited to genuinely carbon-\nfree resources, Petitioners’ proposal would not tip the balance in favor of approval of the Acquisition. First, the commitment to finance the “Clean Firm Technology Fund” is made by Alloy Parent, not the Partners. It is therefore vulnerable to the same concerns about access to capital discussed in Section I.B above: If the Partners do not provide capital to Alloy Parent, a commitment by Alloy Parent to provide financing carries little weight. Second, the “Clean Firm Technology Fund” would provide only five years of funding—the commitment does not provide long-term capital, and as discussed above, the Partners have not committed to maintain ownership of ALLETE for any minimum period of time. Finally, $50 million is a small funding commitment relative to the scale of Minnesota Power’s capital plans. The Company’s 5-year capital plan calls for roughly $5 billion in spending on regulated operations, and the Company estimates its 20-year capital plan at around $20 billion.\n56 \nPetitioners’ claimed rationale for the Acquisition is that the Partners will provide capital to \nfund the Company’s clean energy transition. As discussed above, the Partners have not committed to provide any capital to Minnesota Power after the Acquisition, and Alloy Parent makes no long-\nterm financing commitments beyond the Company’s 5-year capital plan.

The Proposed Settlement Does Not Mitigate the Risks of Partner Control of the \nALLETE Board. \n The ALJ Report correctly found that the Acquisition would likely result in the Partners \nhaving “complete control” of the ALLETE Board of Directors, and that this control poses risks to \nthe public interest.\n57 The Partners will have the power to designate all Board members, and plan \nto actively manage ALLETE’s decisionmaking.58 The Partners “will also be able to override the \nboard’s decisions on important issues” by exercising extensive consent rights.59 The ALJ Report \nconcluded that “the promised governance changes will facilitate ALLETE’s loss of control over \noperations,”60 and identified the resulting risks to the Company and ratepayers: \n§ “ALLETE and its ratepayers could be harmed by conflicts of interest arising from \nbusiness relationships between the utility and Partners’ affiliates or appointed \ndirectors, or an unchecked ability for the Partners to engage in risky financial, \noperational, and governance engineering as they make final budgeting and debt \nissuance decisions.”61 \n \n§ “Decision-making regarding ALLETE’s business plans and operating and capital \nbudgets will shift away from local oversight to the Partners, who have an \nincentive to drive an increase in ALLETE’s near-term returns without regard for \nthe utility’s long-term health.”62 \n \n57 ALJ Report at 54 ¶ 259, 55 ¶ 266. \n58 Id. at 53−54. \n59 Id. at 54 ¶ 260. \n60 Id. at 55 ¶ 265.  \n61 Id. at ¶ 264. \n62 Id. at ¶ 266. \n \n15 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n The ALJ found that “[i]n sum, the proposed governance structures fail to adequately \nbalance the needs of owners, ratepayers, and the community, and pose the risk of outsized \ninfluence by the Partners on the decision-making authority of company management.”63 \nThe Proposed Settlement does not resolve any of these problems. It does nothing to \nmeaningfully limit the Partners’ control of the ALLETE Board. The Partners’ promise to leave the “day-to-day operations” of Minnesota Power to Company management simply echoes language previously proposed in the Company’s testimony.\n64 Moreover, this promise does nothing to limit \nor mitigate the Partners’ control of the Company when the Partners appoint the Board members and have extensive consent rights over every significant decision.\n65 The Proposed Settlement \nwould make slight changes to the Board structure, increasing the number of Directors to fourteen, one more than the thirteen-member Board the Company had proposed in testimony.\n66 However, \nthe Partners would still have the power to appoint thirteen of the fourteen Directors. GIP would still appoint six directors and CPP would appoint four directors based on their respective \nownership shares, while the Partners would jointly appoint three directors by agreement, and the CEO would fill the last seat.\n67 This is essentially the same Board governance structure Petitioners \nproposed in the Company’s rebuttal testimony.68  \nWhile the Proposed Settlement proposes six “independent” directors, up from two \n“independent” directors in Petitioners’ earlier proposal, the Partners would still have the power to \n \n63 Id.  \n64 Compare Proposed Settlement at 5 ¶ 1.23(a) with Ex.

The ALJ Report noted that “[g]iven both Partners are private equity \ninvestors with similar profit motives, they will have little incentive not to vote as a bloc, effectively nullifying input of the independent board directors.”\n69 \nThe ALJ Report concluded that the governance commitments Petitioners proposed in \ntestimony did not adequately mitigate the risk that the Partners’ control of the Board would harm the public interest.\n70 The slight changes to the governance structure in the Proposed Settlement do \nnot remedy this risk and preserve the Partners’ near-total control of the Board. \nF. The Proposed Settlement Does Not Ensure Transparency. \nFinally, the Proposed Settlement does not remedy the lack of transparency that would result \nfrom the Acquisition. After the Acquisition, ALLETE would no longer be a public company and \nwould no longer be subject to the same Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reporting obligations. The ALJ report concluded that “[p]rivatization of ALLETE and the discontinuation of ALLETE’s SEC reporting obligations would significantly reduce information about ALLETE that is available to the Commission and Minnesota ratepayers.”\n71 Petitioners’ testimony proposed \ncommitments requiring ALLETE and Alloy Parent to provide limited financial reports to the Commission, but the ALJ report found that these provisions still represented a decrease in transparency compared to the status quo, and not a benefit.\n72 Moreover, these financial reporting \nrequirements would not apply to the Partners. The ALJ noted that “[i]f the acquisition is approved, \n \n69 ALJ Report at 54 ¶ 259, 31 ¶ 150. \n70 Id. at 31 ¶ 150 (“Commitments 11 through 14 do little to address risks related to the Partners’ \ncontrol of ALLETE’s board. . . The Partners, through their consent rights over material actions \nand their right to appoint board members, would fully control the board and therefore Minnesota \nPower”). \n71 Id. at 51 ¶ 244. \n72 See id. at 36 ¶¶ 173−174, 51 ¶ 243. \n \n17 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n ALLETE would be under no obligation to provide detailed financial information about GIP or \nCPP” and “[t]the Partners have made no voluntary commitment to provide financial information about GIP or CPP.”\n73  \n The Proposed Settlement does not meaningfully improve transparency or remedy the flaws identified by the ALJ Report. The Settlement would require ALLETE and Alloy Parent to provide the Commission and DOC with access to their books and records,\n74 and file audited financial \nstatements for ALLETE and Alloy Parent with the Commission.75 However, the Proposed \nSettlement still does not provide any transparency into the finances of GIP or CPP, who would be ALLETE’s ultimate owners. The result is a net loss of transparency compared to the status quo. \nThe Proposed Settlement’s provisions are functionally the same as the commitments that \nthe Company previously proposed in rebuttal testimony.\n76 The ALJ explained that those proposed \ncommitments “would not be necessary without the transaction and attempt to mitigate a loss of transparency rather than provide an affirmative benefit. Nor do these commitments promise to provide the same information that ALLETE is currently required to provide in SEC reports.”\n77 \nAnd while the commitment to provide access to books and records applies to Alloy Parent, “there is no commitment to provide access to books and records for any entity in the corporate hierarchy above Alloy Parent, even if those book and records relate to regulated operations.”\n78 This remains \ntrue for the provisions in the Proposed Settlement, which do not mitigate the loss of transparency that would result from the Acquisition, and the Partners’ finances would remain opaque. \n \n73 Id. at 51 ¶ 242. \n74 Proposed Settlement at 7 ¶ 1.33 \n75 Id. at 8 ¶ 1.38. \n76 See Ex. MP-27 Schedule 1 at 6 ¶¶ 41−43 (Cady Rebuttal). \n77 ALJ Report at 36 ¶ 173. \n78 Id. at 36−37 ¶ 174. \n \n18 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n II. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN THE \nCOMMISSION’S OCT. 7, 2024 ORDER. \n \nThe Commission’s notice also solicits comment on whether the Proposed Settlement has \n“addressed the questions addressed to the Administrative Law Judge in the Commission’s Order \nof October 7, 2024.” The Proposed Settlement does not adequately address or resolve these issues. Among other topics, the Commission’s October 7, 2024 order asked the ALJ and the parties to address (1) “potential harms to the public interest from the proposed transaction, including in relation to cost or risk,” (2) “potential benefits to ratepayers, Minnesota, or the public interest from the proposed transaction,” (3) whether the proposed transaction is “consistent with the public interest” when “[c]onsidering all relevant factors and applicable law, ” \n(4) whether there are “regulatory requirements or commitments necessary to render the proposed transaction consistent with the public interest,” and (5) how the Acquisition will “impact Minnesota Power’s ability to comply with the carbon-free standard under [Minn. Stat.] § 216B.1691. . .”\n79 Regarding items 1 and 2, the Proposed Settlement does not adequately mitigate \nthe harms and risks of the proposed Acquisition, nor does it confer benefits sufficient to outweigh those harms and risks, as discussed above. The Proposed Settlement therefore fails to provide conditions or commitments sufficient to render the proposed Acquisition consistent with the public interest (items 3 and 4). Finally, regarding item 5, Petitioners have not shown that the Proposed Settlement will improve Minnesota Power’s ability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard, and the evidence shows a risk that Acquisition by the Partners could in fact harm the Company’s compliance with the standard, as explained in Section I.D above. \n \n79 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Order for Hearing, 8 (Oct. 7, 2024). \n \n19 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set out above, the Proposed Settlement does not render the Acquisition \nconsistent with the public interest and does not tip the balance in favor of approval. The \nProposed Settlement does not adequately mitigate the Acquisition’s risks and does not provide any benefits sufficient to outweigh its likely harms.

We support adoption of the Proposed Settlement (the “Settlement”)  \nbecause  we believe its approval is the outcome with the most clean energy benefit  and assurances \ntowards achieving Minnesota’s greenhouse gas reduction goals.  \n \nThe record  developed through the contested case process   makes clear that Minnesota Power ’s \nresource and grid infrastructure plans require a substantial amount of investment.1  Minnesota \nPower’s projected equity  need for infrastructure projects  over the next five years  is at the same \nlevel as the utility has raised over the last 75 years.2  Moreso, w hen comparing Minnesota Power’s \n \n \n1 Surrebuttal Testimony of Craig M. Addonizio , Department of Commerce at  23.6 -23.11 ; Minnesota Po wer’s \nInitial Brief , Minne sota Power  (herein after “MP Initial Brief ”) at 13 -14. \n2 MP Initial Brief at 14.  \n   \n \n \n 2 capital needs over the near -term versus the utility’s overall size, Minnesota Power ranks at the top, \nor in the top handful of utilities in the country  as the most extreme differential .3   \n \nThe resources and infrastructure Minnesota Power plans to build include hundreds of megawatts of \nwind, solar, and storage approved in its most recent Integrated Resource Plan , as well as regional \ntransmission lines approved through the MISO transmission planning process and , ultimately, the \nCommission.4 Fresh Energy  and CGA  were very engaged advocating for both of these outcomes and \nthe subsequent projects. We understand that the precise amount of Minnesota Power’s capital \nneeds can not be known until all specific , individual  projects are  finalized and approved . However, \nbased  on the amount of new clean energy generation and transmission infrastructure  already \napproved  by the Commission and MISO, disputes over the precise amount do not change the overall \nmagnitude of needed investment in our view.   Looking past the next five years, Minnesota Power’s \napproved resource plan includes  ending coal generation on its system  in 2030 for Boswell Unit 3 \nand 2035 for Boswell Unit 4.5 Replacin g Minnesota Power’s coal generation  and other aging \ninfrastructure on its system will require continued, substantial investment  in, and beyond , the next \nfive years.   And certainly, replacing Minnesota Power’s coal with clean energy is the basis for its \nability to meet Minnesota’s 100% clean electricity standard  and economy -wide greenhouse gas \nreduction goals .6 Fresh Energy  and CGA are also intervenors in MP’s current Resource Plan \nproceeding and see a clear sightline to a continued need for substantial clean energy infrastructure \ninvestment specifically for th e aforementioned  reasons  and especially considering federal changes \nto incentives, regulations, and trade policy.  \n \nFor these reasons, Minnesota Power having the capital needed to make new  infrastructure  \ninvestments  is inextricably linked to its ability to continue to decarbonize its system, phase out coal, \nmodernize the state’s and region’s transmission system, and ultimately meet the 100% standard. \nThis infrastructure capital need  and the private buyers’ ability  and incentive  to provide it is the \nmain purpose of the transaction.7 To make that reason even more certain,  the Settlement reached \n \n \n3 Rebuttal Testimony and Schedules John D. Quackenbush , Access to Capital , Minnesota Power at 6.13-8.19, \nSchedule 2.  \n4 See e.g .

MP Initial Brief at 17-20. \n   \n \n \n 3 by the Department  includes a direct and specific capital commitment from the buyers to fund \nMinnesota Power’s five -year plan .8   \n \nWhen weighing the relative risks of securing capital for Minnesota Power’ s projects  as a public \ncompany  in light of it s relatively extreme capital needs versus company size  as well as it s unique \ncustomer profile  with a majority large  industrial customers9, it is also important to consider  the \nchanging dynamics since the acquisition was announced  over a year ago. These change s include, \nbut are  not limited to,  a large -scale repeal of clean energy tax credits, the elimination of nearly  all \nfederal clean energy financial support,  tariffs,  and, importantly, two  major mining customers idling \ntheir mines indefinitely .10  We believe  that there is significantly less risk to achieving Minnesota \nPower’s Commission -approved decarbonization plans, as well setting a path to  realizing the  100%  \nstandard , through approving the Settlement versus  the alternative.  \n \nIn addition, we are very supportive of the Settlement’s inclusion of $50 million of direct funding for \ncarbon -free “firm” technologies .11  This funding directly from shareholders  (and not recoverable \nfrom ratepayers)  is targeted at new or emerging technologies th at must be developed and deployed \nby utilities to  fully decarbonize our electricity system. This funding is particularly important in the \nface of the federal pullback of support for new  technologies through loan guarantees and direct \ngrants.  \n \nFresh Energy  and CGA  also support the Settlement’s inclusion of affordability terms. First, the \nSettlement includes a provision ensuring that, if the transaction is approved, MP will not reduce the \nbudget for MP’s customer affordability program or change the eligibility criteria.12 Second, it \nincludes that the buyers will fund  a reduction in MP customer arrears  to pre -COVID balances or \nlower  and that this effort will be in collaboration with the Energy CENTS Coalition to maximize the \nfunding to benefit low -income customers , not just customers meeting formal definitions of \n“income -qualified” .13 \n \n \n8 Settlement Stipulation , July 11, 2025 (hereinafter “Settlement ”) at 1.3-1.8. \n9 MP Initial Brief at 2.  \n10 More than 600 Iron Range Steelworkers O ut of Work as Auto Industry Cut s Orders Because of Tariffs , The \nMinnesota St ar Tribune , March 20, 2025 available at:  https://www.startribune.com/iron -range -layoffs -\ncleveland -cliffs -taconite -steelworkers/601240194   \n11 Settlement  at 1.63 . \n12 Settlement at 1.47.  \n13 Settlement  at 1.48 , 1.49 . \n   \n \n \n 4  \nFor these reasons, we support adoption of the Settlement approving the transaction as in the public \ninterest . \n \n/s/ Margaret Cherne -Hendrick  \nFresh Energy  \n408 St. Peter Street, Suite 350  \nSt. Paul, MN 55102  \ncherne -hendrick@fresh -energy.org  \n \n \n/s/ Beth Soholt  \nClean Grid Alliance  \nbsoholt @cleangridalliance.org"

PUC Docket Nos.

Both in \nassessing the public record and the Applicants’2 full case, including trade secret and highly \nconfidential trade secret information that was hidden from the public, the ALJ’s findings \nare correct that this deal would tend to harm Minnesota —not just Minnesota Power \ncustomers —and does not bring any benefit in terms of additional or guaranteed \ninvestment to help Minnesota Power transition to clean energy by 2040. Her findings that \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and the Canadian  Pension Plan Investment Board \n(CPP) (collectively “ the Partners ”) have “carefully committed to do very little ,”3 made non -\ncredible assertions and engaged in concerning conduct,4 and furthered claims in public \nfilings  that their internal documents do not match5 are all thoroughly supported by the \nrecord. As such, the ALJ findings should all be adopted and should guide the Commission’s \ndecision to deny this acquisition.  \n \n1 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations (July 15, 2025), eDoc ket \nDocument  No. 20257 -221020 -01 [hereinafter “ALJ Report”].  \n2 In this filing “the Applicants” includes ALLETE, Minnesota Power, GIP, and CPP .  \n3 ALJ Report at 66.  \n4 ALJ Report ⁋ 216, p. 67 n.547.  \n5 E.g. ALJ Report ⁋⁋ 212–222 (regarding public statements regarding rate impacts and \nactual projections of rate impacts).  \n \n \n \n 2 The Applicants offer a single path for Minnesota Power  as a take -it-or-leave it, \ncostly, and questionable plan for the northland. They are sophisticated investors, and the \nCommission  should hold them to higher standards than they apparently hold themselves. \nRejecting this application will allow them to reconsider how they could structure an \nacquisition  without harming the public interest.  \n Additionally, CURE would ask the Commission to rule on a pending motion  to lift \ntrade secret designations6 made in the case that was not resolved by the ALJ. Granting this \nmotion will assist the public to know some of the hidden information regarding potential \nrate impacts. Though this is only one snapshot of such data, it is nonetheless one of the \nmore import ant ways that customers interact with their utility —many public comments  \nfrom Minnesota Power ratepayers  have indicated that rates are already too high and that \nthe Commission should avoid incentivizing large future increases. With the specter of data \ncenter development controlled by the Partners looming  over this proceeding , the public \nhas a right to know more about how much they stand to  lose if the companies execute on \ntheir plans .  \nANALYSIS  \nI. The ALJ is correct that the Applicants have not demonstrated any benefit to \ncustomers or Minnesota , and the deal will ultimately cause far more harm \nthan good  \n \nCURE supports  the ALJ’s findings and conclusions that found  the justification for \nthis acquisition is overstated and unsupported by record evidence.7 It is simply not true \nthat Minnesota Power cannot obtain equity from public markets, or indeed from private \nequity on significantly better terms that would not harm Minnesotans.8 All of the “benefits” \nproposed by the applicants are either minimal and short -term controls that mitigate some  \nacquisition -caused harm without eliminating it, or small handouts that do not \n \n6 OAG Motion to Lift Trade Secret Designations (March 17, 2025) (eDocket Document \nNos. 20253 -216485 -02) (Public), 20253 -216485 -03 (TS)) . \n7 ALJ Report ⁋ 16. \n8 CURE offered direct and surrebuttal evidence from Mark Ellis detailing how private \nequity could participate in utility equity investment without harming utility customers.  \n \n \n \n 3 meaningfully help residents of the northland if this deal does go through. Without this \ndeal, the short -term and insubstantial conditions offered by the companies would not be \nnecessary ; the status quo is demonstrably less harmful  than the proposed acquisition .  \nPrivate equity investment normally seeks short -term excessive profits through \npredictable risky behaviors.  The ALJ correctly found that these companies are likely to \nengage in the same types of behaviors, as established by many parties’ testimony in this \ncase and the Partners ’ own documents.9 Harm to Minnesotans is likely if this deal goes \nthrough without a total overhaul to the proposed purchase price and duration, both of \nwhich  terms of this deal  incentivize the Partners to “buy -build -bail” and leave Minnesota \nholding the bag with a more fragile and less efficient Minnesota Power.10 For these reasons \nthe Commission should adopt the ALJ’s findings and determine that this proposal does not \nbenefit Minnesota and likely will cause serious harm to residents, customers, and \nbusinesses of all sizes that are forced to overpay for excessive pr ivate equity profits.  \nII. The Commission should rule on and grant the Attorney General motion to \nlift trade secret designations  \n \nAs the ALJ’s findings note, “On March 17, 2025, the OAG filed a Notice of Motion \nand Motion to Lift Trade Secret Designation regarding certain Minnesota Power responses \nto information  requests [.]”11 The Department of Commerce supported the motion12 and \nMinnesota Power opposed this motion .13 During the evidentiary hearing, which occurred \nin the days immediately following Minnesota Power’s filing, the ALJ conferred with the  \nOAG in the presence  of all parties and determined  that it was not necessary  that the motion \nbe ruled upon immediately. CURE’s understanding, based partially on prior practice before \n \n9 ALJ report ⁋⁋ 188–199. \n10 Ex.

CURE also believes the motion should be granted \nbecause of the information in the record suggesting that Minnesota Power is courting data \ncenter business and seeks to conceal this (and rate impacts that may come from it) from \nthe public.  \nNotably, in its opposition to the motion proceeding, Minnesota Power has asserted \nthat it should be allowed to keep its prior rate forecasts trade secret partly because releasing \nsuch information “will directly affect the Company’s ability to attract new c ustomers and \nimpact future contract negotiations.”15 The company goes on to specify: “Electric utilities \nthroughout Minnesota are working to attract new, large commercial customers, such as \ndata centers, to their service territories.”16 Based on the utility’s own statements on the \nrecord here and in consistent publicly available information,17 it is clear that attracting data \ncenter development is the utility’s objective .  \nThis stated reason for Minnesota Power’s secrecy also highlights a conflict of interest \nthat would be created by this deal. As discussed in Mr. Baker’s surrebuttal testimony, GIP’s \nparent firm, BlackRock, has pledged a large amount of its resources to data center \n \n14 The ALJ’s Report is a very thorough analysis of a large record, and CURE appreciates \nthat ruling on the motion likely w as omitted due to the larger task before the OAH that \ncoincided with th e motion.  \n15 See Minnesota Power’s Response in Opposition to the Office of the Attorney General – \nResidential Utilities Divi sion’s Motion to Lift Trade Secret Designations , (Mar. 31, 2025 ), \neDocket  Document No. 20253 -217020 -01. \n16 Id.  \n17 Jana Hollingsworth & Walker Orenstein, A massive development is proposed for a \nnortheastern Minnesota city. Local officials aren’t saying what it is. , Minnesota Star \nTribune May 21, 2025, https://www.startribune.com/a -massive -development -is-coming -\nto-a-northeast -minnesota -city-local -officials -arent -saying -what -it-is/601347560  (“The \nindustrial project proposed for Hermantown carries some hallmarks of a data center.”).    \n \n \n \n 5 development in the next few years.18 In recently reported remarks BlackRock Senior \nManaging Director and board member19 (and GIP CEO) Adebayo Ogunlesi , indicated that \nGIP was going to be a leader in financing and building data centers, partially because of \nBlackRock’s ownership stake in all relevant companies who intend to build such \ninfrastructure going forward.20 Mr. Ogunlesi  indicated that 60 percent of the hyperscale  \ndata centers he planned to build would be in the United States, and that competitors would \nonly be left with “crumbs” due to BlackRock’s outsized influence over companies  for which  \nit is a shareholder  or bondholder.21 If this deal is approved, GIP will control both the supply \nof electricity and its demand, through the siting of data centers inside Minnesota Power \nservice territory.  \nThis has a direct relevance to the motion regarding rate forecasts. This acquisition \ncould accelerate and deepen risks to Minnesota Power  ratepayers that are already being \nfelt among utilities that serve large data centers. The report “Extracting Profits from the \nPublic: How Utility Ratepayers are Paying for Big Tech’s Power ,” attached to CURE witness \nJim Baker’s surrebuttal testimony, explains how data centers’ disproportionate market \npower already likely results in other utility customers covering a disproportionate amount \nof costs for data center infrastructure buildout.22 It finds:  \nDetecting wealth transfers from ratepayers to utility shareholders and Big \nTech companies is particularly challenging because utilities ask PUCs for \nconfidential treatment of their contracts with data centers, which limits \nscrutiny of utilities’ proposed d eals and narrows the scope of regulators’ \noptions when they consider utilities’ prices and terms. Meanwhile, regulators \nface political pressure to approve major economic investments already \ntouted by elected officials for their economic impacts.23 \n \n \n18 Ex.

The risks associated with this \ntransaction are many, and the benefit suggested by the Applicant s are flimsy at best, \nillusory at worst.

E-\n015/PA -24-198 and E -015/M -24-383 \n \n \nExecutive Secretary Bull: \n \nCURE submits these initial comments to the  Minnesota  Public Utilities Commission \n(Commission) regarding the questions posed in the  July 18, 20 25, Notice of Comment Period  on \nthe Proposed Settle ment  (Notice) in the  above -referenced docket.  In the Notice the Commission \nasks: “Is the proposed Settlement between the Department of Commerce and ALLETE consistent  \nwith the public interest? ” It is not .  \n \nThe Department  of Commerce ’s (Depa rtment ) political decision to  switch sides in a case is \ncontrary to  its testimony, briefing, and mission to protect Minnesotans in utility proceedings.  It is \ncontra ry to the findings of the Administra tive Law Ju dge (ALJ), which rely in large part on the \ntestimony of the Department regarding the grave harms to the pu blic interest that arise from this \nacquisition.  It has no  legal significan ce, and does not make this acquisition consistent with  the \npublic interest , as correctly found by the ALJ.1 Therefore, the Commission should give this \nproposed resolution no weight and proceed according to the law as the ALJ lai d out in her findings \n \n1 Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations  at 67 n. 549 (July 15, 2025) , \neDocket Document  No. 20257 -221020 -01 [hereinafter “ALJ Rep ort”] (concluding: “the \nAdministrative Law Judge has reviewed the stipulation and notes that her  concerns regarding \nthe Acquisition have not been resolved and it does not change the Administrative Law  Judge’s \nrecommendation to disapprove the Acquisition .”). \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n2 and conclusions. This “settlement ” does not reflect the agreement of most parties to this case, nor \nthe vast majority of public comments opposing this acquisition,  and cannot mitigate the harm \nposed by this prop osed acquisition.  \n \n1. Is the proposed Settlement between the Department of Commerce and ALLETE \nconsistent  with the public interest within the meaning of Minn. Stat. § 216B.50?  \n \nNo. As discussed and evaluated by the A LJ, the overall harm of the transaction far outweigh s the \nconditions p roposed by the Applicants2 and the additional conditions agreed by the Department  \non July 11th. The disproportionat e amount of harm to customers of all types, and r isk of \nmismanagem ent of Minnesota Power are not a side-effect  of this acquisition , they are the \neconomic drivers pushing it forward . Short -term and illus ory commitment s do not mit igate taking \nthis utility into the shadows of private equity management, and cannot fully remedy  the harms to \ntransparency, reliability, affordability, and pu blic confidence that will flow from an approval of \nthis deal.  \n \nAddressing the main themes identi fied by the Department highlights regarding  this agreement:  \n \n• The Department touts i mproved enforcement on the access to equity capital  in its new \nagreement.3 However, it ’s still true that M innesota Power and the other Applicants failed \nto prove that access  to cap ital was a foreseeable problem that it could  not overcome with \nexisting financing options. Thus, improved enforcement on a promise that has no benefit \nis not a benefit  itself.  \n \n• There is no proof that the limited investment in clean firm technology announced in this \nagreement4—amounting to a little over  $8 million per year for just six years —is better than \nwhat would have been invested without the acquisition. Indeed, as discusse d furt her in #5 \nbelow, it appears on the fac e of th e Departm ent’s letter that the C ommission already has \nmore ratepayer money to wor k with from the utility ’s exis ting hoar ding of funds than \noffered by the Appli cants in this settlement.  \n \n• The Departmen t also suggests it has settled for significant ratepayer  savings.5 One year of \ndelay  before a rate  case is no protection at all when it ’s clear that , just like the U PPCO \nexample addressed by the ALJ ’s findings,6 as soon as the year elapse s the companies will \n \n2 In this filing “the Applicants” includes ALLETE, Minnesota Power, GIP, and CPP . \n3 Department of Commerce Letter  at 1, July 11, 2025,  eDocket Document No. 20257 -220879 -02  \n[hereinafter “DOC Letter ”].  \n4 Id. at 2. \n5 Id.  \n6 ALJ Report ⁋⁋ 229–234 (concluding “Given the similarities between ALLETE and UPPCO, the \nAdministrative  Law Judge finds that the private -equity model offered by the Partners is not in \n \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n3 likely file a new rate case. Whi le the settlement purports to set a lower ROE for the utility, \nthis ROE is still far too high considering that the Applicants identif y equity investment \nwithout any r isk as the primary benefit of their acquisition. Moreover, adjusting  Minnes ota \nPower ’s inflated  ROE marginally lower for one year does nothing to protect customers from  \nhigher ROE  values  in future rate cases.  \n \n• Service quality protecti ons and p enalties7 would not be ne cessary if not fo r this acquisition, \nso further assurances that service will remain strong is not a benefit compared wi th the \nstatus quo . Moreover, th ese financial  penalties will be imposed on Minnesota Power —not \nAlloy Parent, ALLETE, or the Partners —risking creating an additional burden for  the \ncompany and its customers  for deficiencies  in service  brought on by unreachable parties \nand the acquisition . \n \n• To the exten t that the Partners get to select and control a majo rity of the boar d mem bers \noverseeing Minnesota Power ’s operations it really is of no con sequence that some of them \nwill meet a definition of “independence. ”8 The agreement notes that seven directors will be \ncontrolled by the Partners , and the CEO of Minnesota Power will also sit on the board, \nmeaning that the Par tners will have an effective majority of eight under this agreement , \njust as they would have  had prior to it.  \n \n• Two years of labor commitments  are mer ely a temporary measure tha t would not have been \nrequired but for this acquisition.9 By its own description, the Department is clear that t hey \nhave obtained no additional labor protections, but merely caused  the Applicants to \ndescribe what was already o ffered and committed to. The ALJ correc tly found that these \nlabor commitments  were not significant  enough to offset the b road and deep harm posed \nby this acquisition.  \n \n2. Has the proposed Settlement addressed the questions addressed to the \nAdministrative  Law Judge in the Commission’s Order of October 7, 2024?  \n \nNo more so than the Applicant s’ weak and illusory  commitments  that have already been analyzed \nand largely rejected by  the A LJ.10 The agreement at issue in this comment perio d does not  \nmaterially change the analysis under any of the questions posed in the October Commission \nOrder.   \n \n \nthe public  interest. ”). See a lso id. at 49 n.  438 ( discussing the bank ruptcy of T XU/Energy Future \nHoldings following private equit y takeover ).  \n7 DOC Letter  at 2.  \n8 See id.   \n9 Id. at 3.  \n10 ALJ Report at 67 n. 549. \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n4 For example, t he fina l question the Commission asked in that October Order state d, in part: “How \nwill the acquisition impact Minnesota Power's ability to comply with the  carbon -free standard \nunder Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691 [?]” The ALJ has already a nswered this : \n \nAt the heart of this matter is the amount of capital Minnesota Power will require,  \nand at what times, to comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard. The \nPetitioners did  not prove by a preponderance of evidence that they will be unable \nto meet the Carbon  Free Standard absent the Acquisition, nor did they guarantee or \npresent sufficient  evidence showing that the standard will be met as a result of the \nAcquisition. Furthermore,  the Legislature did not demand utilities, or the \nCommission, pursue the Carbon Free  Standard at all costs. The Commission is \ntasked with ensuring Minnesota Power’s path  to compliance “maximizes net \nbenefits to all Minnesota citizens.”  Ultimately, even if  declining to approve the \nAcquisition eventually resulted in some complication or short  delay in Minnesota \nPower meeting the Carbon Free Standard, this is not a reason to  approve the \ntransaction given its serious risk to Minnesota ratepayers.11 \n \nNothing in the De partment ’s agreement changes th is fundamental inconsistency between this \nacquisition and the wellbe ing of the public, including Minnesota  Power ’s potential for compliance \nwith the carbon -free standard.  Nothing in the agreement fixes the failure of the Applicants t o \nprove the financial need the y assert, or that they will actually meet th is need in the future.12 The \nrecord in this case has closed, and late fi lings that color around the edges  are unable to change \nthe deficit of evidence of an y meaningful benef it from th is de al.  \n \nThe settlement  build s slightly upon what the Applicants a lready committed to doing in  their \ntestimony , which the Department joined other intervenors in rejecting as insufficient and overall \ncontrary to the public interes t. Ultimately  the announced sti pulation  does not address the \nfundamenta l questions at the center of this case , and cannot rebut the facts as found by the ALJ.  \n \n3. Does the Acquisition proposal as modified by the Settlement agreement provide  \nappropriate protections to low -income customers and customers from \nmarginalized  communities?  \n \nNo. The rate increases that are part and parcel of this proposed acquisition will hit low -income \nand marginalized communities the hardest , both through rate impacts and by causing economic \ndifficulty for busine sses that suppl y industrial empl oyment .13 As the ALJ found  “The Partners’ \n \n11 ALJ Report at 66.  \n12 The Applicants have committed to a short -term investment but have not committed to fun d \nMinnesota Power ’s transition to  100 percent  carbon -free ener gy by 2040.  \n13 ALJ Report  ⁋ 220 (“These projected rate increases will likely exceed the inflation rate, adversely  \nimpacting the budgets of residential customers and the economic competitiveness of  ALLETE’s \nlarge industrial customers. ”). \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n5 private memoranda, modeling, and communications with  potential investors establish that the \nPartners are planning on significant rate increases  that will likely exceed the long -run rate of \ninflation. . . . The Acquisition creates an unacceptable  risk of rate increase and rate shock in a \ncritical and economically vulnerable area of  Minnesota. ”14 \n \nOn the  Iron Range and in Duluth people are already finding their utility bills unmana geable,15 and \nthis acquis ition will make a difficult situation much  worse. While it is important  that the \nCommission take action to provide  for continued funding for low -income energy assista nce \nprograms, keeping rates mana geable in the  first place pro tects many more customers from falling \ninto financial difficulty that puts them in need of  such interven tions. Th us, rejecting the deal will \nprotect low -income and marginalized customers far better than anything proposed in this \nsettlement .  \n \nA one-year delay before the next rate case is  wholly insuffi cient to protect these communities.16  \n \n4. Are there conditions that should be imposed on this transaction in addition to \nthose that  were included in the settlement, and if so, what are those conditions? \nPlease describe the  additional condition and support its inclusion.  \n \nThe minimal guard rails outlined in the Department’s agreement do not adequately protect the \npublic interest , and no iterative conditions appended to this d eal can overcome the broad harm \nthat will follow  the acquisition .  \n \nAny condition s that would be sufficient to render this acquisition consistent with  the public \ninterest would require chang ing the fundamental terms of the deal. For example, limiting the \nutility ’s ROE to 6 percent for the entire period that Minnesota Power  is own ed by the Partners \nwould signi ficantly decrease the  potential for  harm to customers, but would also negate the large \npremium that the Partners  have offered to pay the current  stock  owners. Thus, in order to se t a \nrational and protective ROE  (far below what the Department agreed to here) , the Commission \nwould  also have to change the overall sale price agreed by the Applicants , providing the buyers \nwith a large discount and denying the sellers their  unearned windfall.  \n \nSuch terms  can be renegot iated b etween  the Applicant s followin g the Commission ’s rejection of \nthis deal, but it is not for the Commission to labor through all of the material and structural  \nchanges that will need to be done in order to erase the harm  posed by this proposal.  \n \n \n14 Id. ⁋ 222. \n15 There is copious evidence of this in the public comments submitted in this record. See \ngenerally  Addendum A – Summary of Public Comments, July 15, 2025, eDocket  Document No. \n20257 -221020 -02.  \n16 Considering t he ALJ’s findings, vulnera ble communities w ill on ly be safe if the utility agree s to \na rate case  stay out  for the entire time that the company is privately held . \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n6 5. Are there other issues or concerns related to this matter?  \n \nYes. After rejectin g this acquisition , the Commission should order Minnesota Power to use \nidentified land profits  for clean firm technology  and low -income programs .  \n \nThe Department ’s letter ac companying the settlement make s much  of a $50 million investment in \nclean firm technology,17 but in the very next paragraph notes that Minnesota Power has \nmisapp ropriated $75.4 million of customer funds from land sales.18 One doe s not need to be a  \nfinancial expert to realize that $75.4 million  is larger than $50 million. By taking this existing lump \nsum and using it for clean firm technology investment , Minnesota Power would have even more \nmoney than the P artners have agreed to provide —and without any need for this a cquisition. \nMoreover, the additional surplus of $25.4 million could be split between low -income customer \nprograms and additional investment in clean energy  to the be nefit of utility customers . Rate payers \nwould benefit from these investments with lower u tility bills in the future, some what making up \nfor the  fact th at this funding has not been refun ded as the Commission originally ordered .   \n \nThe Commission does not need to approve this acquisition in order to achieve any material  \nbenefits identified in this agreement .  \n \n \n/s/ Hudson Kingston     \nHudson B.

As discussed herein, \nLPI fully supports the ALJ Report and requests the Commission adopt the ALJ Report in its \nentirety.    \nI. INTRODUCTION  \nThe ALJ Report is thorough, well -reasoned and methodically addresses the issues noticed \nfor hearing in this proceeding.1  This proceeding has been lengthy and complex ; over the course \nof more than a year, the Parties in this proceeding have engaged in extensive discovery, filed \nrounds of comments  and motions to compel , participated in settlement discussions , engaged in \nthree days of evidentiary hearings, and submitted two rounds of briefing.2  Through this \nproceeding, ALLETE and Minnesota Power seek  to be acquired by Canada Pension Plan \n \n1  Order Requiring Additional Information and Granting Intervention, and Notice of and Order for \nHearing at 8 (Oct. 7, 2024) (eDocket No. 202410-210754- 01) (noticing for hearing the following issues: \n(1) the potential harms to the public interest from the proposed transaction, including in relation to cost of \nrisk; (2) any potential benefits to ratepayers, Minnesota, or the public interest from the proposed transaction; (3) whether the proposed transaction is in the public interest in consideration of all relevant factors and  \napplicable law; (4) whether regulatory requirements or commitments are necessary to render the proposed transaction consistent with the public interest; (5) how relevant and related dockets pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and/or other state, federal or foreign government agencies impact the Commission’s consideration of the proposed transaction; (6) how the acquisition will impact Minnesota Power’s union and non-union workforce and do the \nprotections included in the acquisition adequately protect that workforce, and (7) how the acquisition will \nimpact Minnesota Power's ability to comply with the carbon-free standard under Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, \nincluding any modifications of plans associated with the Nemadji Trail Energy Center). \n2  The Parties in this proceeding include: Minnesota Power, CPP Investments and GIP, Minnesota \nDepartment of Commerce, Minnesota Office of Attorney General - Residential Utilities Division, Large \nPower Intervenors, CURE, Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, Sierra Club, International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers Local Union 31, Laborers' International Union of North America District Council of \nMinnesota and North Dakota, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49 (Local 49) and North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters, Energy CENTS Coalition (hereinafter, “the Parties”).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION  EXCISED  \n \n 2 Investment Board (“CPP”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) (collectively, “the Partners”  \nor “Petitioners”) .  ALLETE and the Partners allege that acquisition by these two private equity \nconglomerates is needed to improve its access to capital  to support the clean energy transition.3  \nThe evidence in the record , however,  has repeatedly demonstrated, and the ALJ has affirmed, that \nALLETE’s “need” for capital is artificially inflated, and that the consummation of this Acquisition \ncould cause serious harm to ratepayers.  Put simply, there is no benefit to be gained by the proposed Acquisition, and instead, the Acquisition poses great harm.  As stated in the ALJ Report , “the \nproposed Acquisition is not in the public interest.”\n4  LPI agrees and submits th is comment to \naddress the following questions in the Notice: \n1. Are the findings of the Administrative Law Judge consistent with Minn. Stat. §  \n216B.50 and other Minnesota Statutes and Rules?  \n2. Should the Commission adopt or modify the ALJ Report, and if so, what \nmodifications should the Commission make?  \n3. Are there other issues or concerns related to this matter?  \nBased on the analysis below, and in response to the questions above, LPI  respectfully requests the \nCommission deny the P roposed Acquisition and require Minnesota Power to “ provide the full \naccounting of costs that were incurred in negotiating the proposed acquisition and seeking its \nregulatory approvals, including the employee time spent in pursuing the acquisition.”5   \n \n3  Initial Filing – Petition for Approval at 1 (Jul. 19, 2024) (eDocket No.20247- 208768 -01) \n(“Petition”) . \n4  ALJ Report at 72.  \n5  ALJ Report  at 68, P 2 .  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION  EXCISED  \n \n 3 II. ANALYSIS  \nA. The ALJ’s Findings Are Well -Founded, Consistent with the Relevant Minnesota \nRules and Statutes,  and Warrant Deference. \n1. Overview of Applicable Law \nThis proceeding came before the Office  of Administrative Hearings (“O AH” ) for a \ncontested case proceeding pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 (2024) .  Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 \nrequires that:  \nNo public utility shall sell, acquire, lease, or rent any plant as an \noperating unit or system in this state for a total consideration in excess of $1,000,000, or merge or consolidate with another public utility or transmission company operating in this st ate, without first \nbeing authorized so to do by the commission.  Upon the filing of an \napplication for the approval and consent of the commission, the commission shall investigate, with or without public hearing.  The \ncommission shall hold a public hearing, upon such notice as the commission may require.  If the commission finds that the proposed \naction is consistent with the public interest, it shall give its consent and approval by order in writing.  In reaching its determination, the commission shall take into consideration the reasonable value of the property, plant, or securities to be acquired or disposed of, or merged and consolidated. \nIn conformance with Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, the ALJ has investigated the application for the \nacquisition of a public utility  and determined the Proposed Acquisition is  not in the public interest.  \nPursuant to the directive in Minn Stat. § 216B.50 for the Commission to, when considering \napproval of the acquisition, merger, or consolidation of a public utility in Minnesota, find that “the \nproposed action is consistent with the public interest” before giving “its consent and approval ,” \nthe Commission has discretion in what public interest standard to apply when determining whether the Proposed Acquisition comports with the public interest.  However, the Commission has historically looked for meaningful commitments and benefits to ratepayers that closely mirror \nthose needed to satisfy the “net benefits” test (i.e., that a transaction leaves ratepayers better off as \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION  EXCISED  \n \n 4 a result).6  While the Partners advocate for a lower standard, the ALJ correctly concludes, in \nrecommending rejection of the Proposed Acquisition: \nThe parties have argued that the public interest requires the \nCommission find that the deal either produces net benefits or, alternatively, avoids net harm.  The proposed deal is inconsistent \nwith the public interest under either standard because it results in net harm to the public interest.\n7 \nThe ALJ Report fastidiously examined each facet of the Proposed Acquisition to determine \nwhether it would bestow on ratepayers any benefit.  In doing so, the ALJ fully considered all of \nthe relevant record evidence before her, made critical credibility determinations, described her \nfindings and analysis in great detail, and concluded that the Commission should deny the Proposed Acquisition.  \n2. The ALJ Report  Is Consistent with Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 and O ther \nMinnesota Statutes and Rules.  \nThe findings, conclusions and recommendations of the ALJ derive from an extensive and \nthorough review of the fulsome record, and merit “considerable deference.”\n8  Based on her \nrigorous fact -finding and extensive familiarity with the record in this case, the ALJ made several \n \n6  E.g., Ex. MP- 59 at P 29 (Hydro One Ltd. And Avista Corp. Washington Utilities and Transportation \nCommission Docket No. U -170970 – 12/5/2018 Order 07); In the Matter of The Joint Application of \nIberdrola, S.A., et al., for Approval of the Merger of NM Green Holdings with PNM Resources Inc. , Case \nNo. 20-00222 -UT, Certification of Stipulation at 31 (N.M. P. R. C., Nov. 1, 2021) (finding that when \napplying the statutory public interest standard to a merger transaction, “the complexities of mergers should \nrequire a positive benefit to ratepayer s if they are to be approved,” ultimately finding the Proposed \nTransaction’s potential harms outweighed its potential benefits). \n7  ALJ Report at 61, P 15 (citing Minn.

Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm’n , 599 F.2d 453, 463 (1st Cir. \n1979) (“The amount of deference to which the ALJ’s credibility determination is entitled is “considerable.””). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION  EXCISED  \n \n 5 important findings to support a fact that has become abundantly clear throughout this proceeding: \n“the proposed Acquisition is not in the public interest.”9 \nThe ALJ Report  reject s many of the Petitioners’  offered commitments and claimed benefits \nof the Proposed Acquisition.  In rejecting them, the ALJ found many of the commitments to be \ninsufficient (e.g., the  commitment to not “ make any dividend or distributions unless at least one \nsenior unsecured credit rating is investment grade or above ,” which the ALJ found to be “at best,” \na “weak protection against cost -of-debt increases”),10 already required by law ( e.g., Minnesota \nPower would make compliance filings on equity infusions from and dividends to Alloy Parent (Commitment 2), which the ALJ stated “is required by law” through capital -structure filings ),\n11 or \noffering no benefit to ratepayers ( e.g., the commitment to “not any dividend or distribution that \nwould cause the actual equity ratio of Minnesota Power to be outside the range approved by the Commission ,” which the ALJ stated provides no benefit to ratepayers because ALLETE and \nMinnesota Power are required to maintain the Commission -approved equity ratio range regardless \nof A cquisition approval ).\n12  These  examples make up just the first four commitments – the \nremaining commitments fare no better under the ALJ’s scrutiny.  \nThe ALJ Report describes the Partners’ contention that public markets cannot meet its \nclaimed need for capital as “likely overstated,”  leaving the ALJ unpersuaded as to the Partners’ \n \n9  ALJ Report at 72.  \n10  ALJ Report  at 32, P 144.  \n11  ALJ Report  at 31 -32, P 142 . \n12  ALJ Report  at 32 , P 143.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION  EXCISED  \n \n 6 foundational claim that it must seek capital outside the public market.13  Further, the ALJ expresse s \nconcerns about :  \n1. the strategies through which the Partners propose to increase returns,14  \n2. the potential for an early exit if expected returns cannot be met,15  \n3. the potential for reduction in cooperation by the utility,16 and  \n4. the level of control the Partners seek over decision -making of ALLETE’s business \nplans and operating and capital budgets.17   \nGenerally, the ALJ explain s the Acquisition would likely carry significant risks of ratepayer harm, \nin the form of projected  rate increases (driven by ALLETE’s share price being a “premium of $1.5 \nbillion over ALLETE’s book value”),18 the Partners exorbitant expected returns,19 and the \n“credible risk” of service quality deteriorations .20  The ALJ Report undermines  each and every \naspect of the P roposed Acquisition in great detail, with record citation and analysis, thus leav ing \nit irredeemable.  T o be abundantly clear, the ALJ did not make her findings in a vacuum – each \nparagraph is informed by her position as the trier of fact, her thorough inspection of the record , \nand her careful balancing of arguments.   \n \n13  ALJ Report  at 24, P 128 (stating also that “ALLETE has consistently overestimated its capital \nneeds each year since 2019.”) \n14  ALJ Report  at 48, P 211. \n15  ALJ Report at 47 -48, PP 200 -11. \n16  ALJ Report  at 47-48, PP 203 -11. \n17  ALJ Report  at 57-61, PP 251 -66. \n18  ALJ Report  at 49, P 212.  \n19  E.g., ALJ Report  at 49, P 215.  \n20  ALJ Report  at 52, P 228.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION  EXCISED  \n \n 7 a. The ALJ’s Credibility Determination s Warrant Deference.  \nThe ALJ made specific credibility determinations as to the Partners , their intentions, and \nthe Proposed Acquisition’s impact on the public interest that warrant Commission attention and \ndeference.  T he ALJ’s findings of fact, after presiding over three days of evidentiary hearings, \nreview of the fulsome record, and thorough engagement with the parties and their arguments , \nrequire substantial deference.21 \nWhere the opinions of expert witnesses conflict, the conflict should be resolved by the trier \nof fact.22  The trier of fact is well -poised to “determine the comparative weight to be given to the \nrespective opinions and consider the qualifications of each expert and the source of his \ninformation.”23  Specifically “[t]he credibility findings of the person who sees and hears the \nwitnesses be he ALJ, jury, or judge is entitled to considerable deference .”24  As stated in George \nA. Beck, Larry A. Bakken, and Thomas Much, Minnesota Administrative Procedure § 9.1 at 226 \n(1987): \nIn a case where the ALJ’s findings rest on the credibility of \nwitnesses, the agency still had final responsibility to determine the findings of fact.  However, the credibility determinations of the ALJ, \nwho actually saw the witnesses, are entitled  to some weight.  The \nagency may need to show a sufficient basis to reverse the credibility findings of the ALJ.  On judicial review, the findings of the ALJ \nmay bear on the determination of whether substantial evidence supports the final agency decision.\n25 \n \n21  General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 463 (“The amount of deference to which the ALJ’s credibility \ndetermination is entitled is “considerable.”). \n22  Robertson v.

MP -11 at 14 (Taran Direct) ).   \n28  ALJ Report  at 38, P 131 (“In its 2023 annual report, ALLETE told investors that it had adequate \naccess to capital markets.”)  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION  EXCISED  \n \n 9 the credibility of ALLETE’s argument, determining ALLETE failed to establish a significant risk \nexisted that the public markets would be unable to meet ALLETE’s probable capital needs.29 \n(2) Credibility Concerns Regarding Financial E ngineering and \nExpected Returns \nGenerally, the ALJ found that the annual returns the Partners’ seek to extract from \nALLETE “exceed credible cost of equity estimates for average- risk publicly traded companies.”30  \nIn discussing the Partners’ expectation to earn [NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . .  \n . . . NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA ENDS] on their investment in ALLETE , \nthe ALJ found such returns to “exceed credible estimates from respectable cost of equity sources for average risk publicly traded companies…,” finding most to be below 8 percent.\n31  Further, the \nALJ found the “ Partners’ disavowal of “stereotypical” private equity tactics such as “debt \nleveraging, cost- cutting operational changes, and asset sales” to achieve their desired returns lack \ncredibility .”32 \n(3) Credibility of Partners and Behavior Throughout Proceeding  \nThe ALJ also detailed several  evidentiary mishap s that occurred during the proceeding that \nraised concerns regarding the Partners’ behaviors.   First, the ALJ noted the Partners’ redaction of \n“highly relevant” information, which was “improperly redacted” and only produced after a motion to compel and an in-camera  inspection.\n33  Second, the ALJ described  the Partners’ attempt to \nimproperly introduce a new agreement during the course of hearing, “ drafted the night before, \n \n29  ALJ Report  at 30, P 135.  \n30  ALJ Report  at 44, P 189.  \n31  ALJ Report  at 49, P 215.  \n32  ALJ Report  at 50, P 216 (citing Ex.

NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA ENDS] .  The\n  glaring lack of \nawareness of ALLETE’s top officers to the impacts of the Proposed Acquisition on governance \nand control post -Acquisition deeply concerned the ALJ, as characterized by her finding that \n“ALLETE does not fully appreciate how much control the Partners will have over its post -\ntransaction affairs .”39 \n \n34  ALJ Report  at 73, n.605 (emphasis added) . \n35  Ex. LPI-1005  (DOC IR 0011 Supp 2 HCTS) ; see also Tr. Vol. 1 at 256:4 -261:18  (emphasis added). \n36  ALJ Report  at 73, n.605.  \n37  Tr.

The Commission Should Adopt the ALJ Report  in Full, Without Modification . \nThe ALJ Report  is shaped by her rigorous engagement with Parties throughout this \nproceeding, and extensive knowledge of the record – as such, it  warrant s “considerable” \ndeference.40  There is no reason for the Commission to deviate from these findings.  For each fact \nand conclusion the ALJ made, she provided support and reasoned explanations.  Ultimately, her \nfindings support that “the proposed Acquisition is not in the public interest.”41  The Commission \nshould adopt the ALJ Report  in full without modification.  \nAdditionally, the ALJ’s recommendation that the Commission require Minnesota Power to \nprovide a full account of costs incurred to negotiate the Proposed Acquisition and seek regulatory approvals is informed by her attentive  participation in this docket.\n42  As such, her perspective on \nthis issue should not be taken lightly.  Ratepayers should not be made to bear the costs Minnesota Power and ALLETE have incurred to put forth a proposal that poses significant harm  to their \ninterests and provides no meaningful benefits.  Therefore, LPI fully supports the ALJ’s recommendation for a full accounting of costs by Minnesota Power. \nC. Other Issues and Concerns to Raise \n LPI is deeply concerned with the proposed settlement offered by the Department of \nCommerce and Petitioners .  Rather than address those concerns in this document, LPI has, \nconsistent with the Commission’s direction, provided its concerns separately.43 \n \n40  General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at  463. \n41  ALJ Report  at 72.  \n42  ALJ Report  at 68.  \n43  Notice of Comment Period on the Proposed Settlement, Docket No. E-015/PA -24-198, OAH \nDocket Number 25 -2500- 40339 (Jul . 18, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257-221154-01).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION  EXCISED  \n \n 12 III. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons described herein above, LPI respectfully requests the Commission  approve \nthe ALJ  Report .  Rigorous analysis and thorough review of the fulsome record underlie the ALJ  \nReport , which, in conjunction with the deference required, should guide the Commission ’s denial \nof the acquisition of ALLETE, Inc.44  Additionally, Minnesota Power should “ provide the full \naccounting of costs that were incurred in negotiating the proposed acquisition and seeking its \nregulatory approvals, including the employee time spent in pursuing the acquisition.”45 \nDated:     August 4, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \nSTOEL RIVES LLP  \n \n/s/ Andrew P.

Therefore, \nwe were surprised when the  settling parties chose to file the Stipulation four days before the \nAdministrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) filed her Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, an d Recommendation \n(the “ALJ Report”). Having now reviewed the proposed Settlement , we find it does not  resolve our \nconcerns about the Acquisition or change our recommendation that it be denied. The ALJ had a similar \nreaction, as she noted in the ALJ Report:  \n \nOn July 11, 2025, just days prior to the due date for this Report, the Department and the \nPartners filed a settlement stipulation. While the timing of the filing did not allow adequate \ntime for the Administrative Law Judge to incorporate this development i nto Report, and this \nReport does not explicitly consider the settlement agreement, the Administrative Law Judge has reviewed the stipulation and notes that her concerns regarding the Acquisition have not \nbeen resolved and it does not change the Administrat ive Law Judge’s recommendation to \ndisapprove the Acquisition.\n1  \n \n1 See In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for the Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations(“ALJ Report”), Docket No. E -015/PA -\n24-198 (July 15, 2025), p. 73 FN 607  (“On July 11, 2025, just days prior to the due date for this Report, the Department and the \nPartners filed a settlement stipulation.

DISCUSSION  \n \nA. The proposed Settlement does not render the Acquisition  consistent with \nthe public interest within the meaning of Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 . \n \nMinn. Stat. § 216B.50  provides that the C ommission may approve  actions like the proposed \nAcquisition so long as it is “consistent with the public interest.”  Throughout t his proceeding, parties \nhave suggested different approaches to more precisely defining what it means to be “consistent with \nthe public interest.”  In a memorandum accompanying the ALJ Report, the ALJ provided a helpful \nsummary of the Commission’s past approach to and interpretations of that standard.  She concluded \nmost relevant Commission pro ceedings applying the Minn. Stat. §  216B.50 standard  “looked for \nmeaningful commitments and benefits to ratepayers that closely mirror those needed to satisfy the ‘net benefits’  test. ”\n2 In other words, in order for the Acquisition to be “consistent with the public \ninterest,” its  potential benefits must outweigh its potential harms.  \n \nMeanwhile, throughout their filings in this docket, the Petitioners suggest that approving the \nProposed Acquisition is consistent with the public interest because it would improve  access to capital \nthe Company needs t o comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard (Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691 Subd. \n2g).3 Because complying with the Carbon Free Standard is foundational to the Petitioners’ arguments \n \nAdministrative Law Judge has reviewed the stipulation and notes that her concerns regarding the Acquisition have not been \nresolved and it does not change the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation to disapprove the Acquisition.”)  \n2 Id., citing  In re Pet. of N.

MP -9 (Cady Direct) at 13 (eDocket No. 202412- 212968- 03) (“ [A]s an over -arching matter, the Acquisition will provide \nMinnesota Power and, thus, its customers access to capital that will allow for compliance with the Minnesota Carbon Free \nStandard and accelerated renewable energy standard under Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691: ); See also , Ex. MP -31 (Alley Rebuttal) at \n28 (eDocket No. 20253- 216055- 09) (“Growth in ALLETE’s market value rests heavily on Minnesota Power’s ability to continue \nproviding reliable service to customers at affordable rates while successfully implementing its plan to comply with \nMinnesota’s Carbon Free Standard”); Ex. MP -33 (Bram Rebuttal) at  3 (eDocket No. 20253- 216055- 08) (“GIP recognized \nALLETE’s history of successful management and operations as well as its commitment to Minnesota’s decarbonization policy, \nand ALLETE’s objective to establish itself as the “utility of the future” –  a utility running on carbon -free energy  that is still safe, \n3 \n as to why the Acquisition should be approved , the Commission should also consider its role and \nresponsibilities under the legislation establishing that Standard.  Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 9 \nrequires th at the  Commission “maximizes net benefits”  to all Minnesota citizens  when implementing \nthe Carbon Free Standard.4 This provides further reason for the Commission to apply a “net benefits” \ntest when considering approval of the Acquisition and/or  proposed Settlement . For the Acquisition \n(as modified by the Settlement) to provide net benefits, the conditions discussed in the proposed \nSettlement must introduce new  benefits that outweigh the new  risks introduced by the Acquisition.  \n \ni. The Acquisition introduces new risks to Minnesota Power and its ratepayers.  \n \nPrior to entering into the proposed Settlement , the Department argued:  “Petitioners have \nfailed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that their proposed deal is consistent with the public interest.”\n5 The Department gave the following reasons  (among others)  for reaching this \nconclusion :   \n \n• Petitioners have neither established that their deal, as proposed, will produce meaningful benefits, nor have they refuted the foreseeable risks.\n6 \n \n• The Commission cannot be certain the deal will finance ALLETE’s energy transition because \nthe final merger agreement contains no binding capital commitment.7 \n \n• Even if the Partners do provide capital, their plan to use risky financial strategies could \nfinancially weaken ALLETE —and could dramatically increase rates by 2030.8 \n \n• Despite the deal’s risks to ALLETE’s financial healthy, ratepayers, and the energy transition, \nPetitioners have proposed inadequate governance and ring fencing measures.9 \n \nreliable, and affordable. Achieving these goals is not merely an operational and management target, but also a requirement \nunder the Carbon Free Standard in Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 2g”).  \n4 See ALJ Report at 72, citing Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 9.  \n5 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for the Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Gl obal \nInfrastructure Partners,  Department Reply Brief, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 ( May  29, 2025), p. 1 (“ Department Reply Brief ”). \n6 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for the Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Gl obal \nInfrastructure Partners,  Department Initial Brief, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 ( May  1, 2025), p. 1 (“ Department Initial  Brief ”). \n7 Id. \n8 Id. \n9 Id. \n4 \n  \n• Despite their oft -repeated commitment to the regulatory compact, Petitioners have no plans \nto comply with the affiliated -interest statute. Rather, they propose an alternative that would \ndeprive ratepayers of needed statutory protections.10 \n \nCUB (along with other opposing parties) share s each of these concerns. Because there are new  risks \nintroduced by the Acquisition, the proposed Settlement is only consistent with the public interest if it \nintroduces new  benefits that outweigh those risks.  \n \nii. The proposed Settlement does too little to address new risk introduced by the \nAcquisition . \n \nMany of the  commitments included in the proposed Settlement  repeat commitments the \nPetitioners made months ago,  that were previously considered by the Department, and that the ALJ \naddressed one- by-one in her Report. Rather than repeat the ALJ’s analysis of each of those \ncommitments, we will simply note our strong agreement with her high -level conclusion:  \n \nThe proposed commitments offered by Petitioners do not rebalance the transaction to avoid \nnet harm. Many of the commitments simply restate existing legal requirements and therefore \ndo not provide additional protections to counterbalance new risks arising as a result of the \nAcquisition. Some of the proposed conditions may be unenforceable. And others offer little \nbenefit to ratepayers or the regulatory compact. It also appears that many of the Petitioners’ \nproposed commitments are out of step with other recent take -private transactions involving \nutilities .11  \n \nAccording to the proposed Settlement  “Paragraphs 1.4 -1.6, 1.9, 1.12 -1.14, 1.17 -1.30, 1.32 -1.36, 1.38, \n1.40 -1.46, 1.56, 1.63 -1.64, and 1.73 -1.74 were negotiated by the Settling Parties for purposes of this \ncomprehensive proposed Settlement .”12 We disagree each of these Paragraphs reflect new \ncommitments  or introduce new benefits . Nevertheless, we address each in turn  below.  \n \nAs the Department noted in briefs, “ALLETE did not seek a binding, written capital commitment \nfrom the Partners during negotiations ” and the Merger Agreement “does not include a binding capital \n \n10 Id. at 2.  \n11 ALJ Report at 67.  \n12 Proposed Settlement  at FN 3.  \n5 \n commitment by the Partners. ”13 Paragraph  1.4 of the proposed Settlement  purportedly “ensure[s] \nenforceability of the capital commitment,” by stating : \n \nALLETE shall not make any dividend payments to Alloy Parent (the entity through which the \nPartners would receive any dividends from the company) unless, at the time the dividend \npayment would be made, Minnesota Power has been provided sufficient equity cap ital \nneeded up to that point in time to fund the 5 year capital investment plan in the February \n2025 10 -K, subject to prospective reasonable and prudent plan adjustments by the \ncompany.14 \n \nRelatedly, Paragraph 1.5 provides that Minnesota Power will make a filing with the Commission before \nissuing any such dividend to Alloy, and Paragraph 1.6 restrict s ALLETE from making any dividend or \ndistributions to Alloy unless at least one senior unsecured credit rating is investment grade or above.15 \nThese commitments  do nothing to “ensure enforceability” of the Partners’ capital commitments  \nbecause they do not address the underlying problem the Department identified: the Partners have \nmade no binding legal commit to provide equity capital to ALLETE. At best, the first of these commitments incentivizes the Partners to provide equity capital if they expect to receive dividends \nfrom ALLETE. But, in touting the attributes of “patient capital”  throughout this proceeding,  the P artners  \nhave emphasized  they are not expecting or dependent on receiving ALLETE distributions anytime \nsoon.\n16 \n  \nParagraph 1.9 provides:  \n \nALLETE will not make any dividend or distribution that would cause the actual equity ratio of \nMinnesota Power to be outside the range approved by the Commission. ALLETE will use \ncommercially reasonable efforts to maintain its current corporate and facility  ratings. ALLETE \nand Minnesota Power to the extent applicable shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remain rated by at least two credit rating agencies. Neither ALLETE nor Minnesota Power to \nthe extent applicable will opt to cease being rated by a c redit rating agency.\n17 \n \nThese commitments are neither new nor meaningful . As noted by the ALJ, the  first commitment “does \nnot provide any benefit because ALLETE and Minnesota Power are required to maintain the equity \n \n13 Department Initial Brief at 19.  \n14 Proposed Settlement at 3.  \n15 Id.  \n16 See e.g., Petition at 16  (““private investors such as the Partners have an ability to exercise more patience with respect to \nquarterly earnings and dividends due to a focus on long -term investments.”)  \n17 Proposed Settlement at 3.  \n6 \n ratio range approved by the Commission regardless of whether the acquisition is approved.”18 The \nnext two commitments “provide little benefit because ALLETE has not established what ‘commercially \nreasonable’ efforts are in either context or that it would be reasonable not to use ‘commercially \nreasonable’ efforts.”19 The final commitment seems redundant  given the prior commitment to remain \nrated by at least two credit rating agencies. It is also unclear whether or why ALLETE or Minnesota \nPower would opt to cease being rated by a credit rating agency absent this commitment.  \n \nParagraph 1.12 states that “[i]f Minnesota Power’s cost of debt increases above current levels \nwithin five years following the close of the Acquisition, Minnesota ratepayers will be held harmless \nfrom any rate impact unless Minnesota Power can demonstrate that its increased cost of debt was \nnot caused by the Acquisition.”20 This enhances the Petitioner’s prior commitment  to hold ratepayers \nharmless if Minnesota Power’s cost of debt increases above current levels within three years following \nthe close of the Acquisition.21 While an improvement, the Department has  not explained whether and \nhow it determined  five years, rather than three years, is long enough to overcome Department \nWitness Addonizio’s  initial skepticism over the value of this  time -limited commitment.22  \n \nParagraphs 1.13 commits that “Minnesota Power shall maintain its capital structure within the \nrange approved by the Commission in the annual capital structure filing, and Minnesota Power will continue its efforts to manage its capital structure to the level approved in its most recent Minnesota \nrate case if the Commission adopts a new holding company structure proposed in paragraph 1.27. ”\n23 \nThis Paragraph merely states what would be required of Minnesota Power regardless of whether the commitment is made : Minnesota Power must comply wit h the Commission’s orders.  Therefore, it has \nlittle  value in resolving opposing parties’ concerns.  \n \nParagraph 1.14 commits to change Minnesota’ Power’s ROE from 9.78 percent to 9.65 percent, \nwhich would remain in effect until the Commission approves final rates in Minnesota Power’s next \n \n18 ALJ Report at 32  \n19 Id. \n20 Proposed Settlement  at 4.  \n21 Ex.

These  commitments are not materially different from commitments the Petitioners made \nmonths ago, and that the ALJ  considered  in her Report . As the ALJ noted, t hese commitments “attempt \nto protect against the risks of the acquisition by maintaining the status quo. But these commitments \nwould not prevent the Partners from using ALLETE’s shares to guarantee Alloy Parent’s debt. They \nalso do not insulate Minnesota P ower’s ratepayers from higher debt costs resulting from exposure to \nthe risks of debt held at Alloy Parent.”27  \n \nParagraphs 1.23 through 1.26 relate to the governance of ALLETE. The Department describes \nthe impact  these commitments would have on ALLETE’s board composition as follows:  \n \nThe Partners will select ten directors based on their respective ownership interests. The \nPartners will select three directors by agreement. The final director will be ALLETE’s CEO. Of \nthe thirteen non -CEO directors, six of them will meet the NYSE’s defini tion of independence \nand the Partners will appoint the remaining seven directors to represent their respective \ninterests consistent with their fiduciary obligations to ALLETE under Minnesota law.28   \n \nIn other words, the Partners will appoint (either individually or collectively) 13 out of 14 Directors. Five \nof the 14 will be “independent” but still appointed by the Partners. (The 6th independent director will \nbe ALLETE’s current CEO.) A majority of Dir ectors (8 of 14) will be appointed by the Partners and will \nnot be independent. As the ALJ noted: “[g]iven both Partners are private equity investors with similar \nprofit motives, they will have little incentive not to vote as a bloc, effectively nullifying  input of the \nindependent board directors .”29 This problem is not resolved by the proposed Settlement. More \nworrisome, t hese commitments do nothing to directly address the extensive consent rights the \n \n24 Proposed Settlement at 4.  \n25 We expect Minnesota Power will seek to increase its ROE in its next rate case filing , as it has (and utility’s typically do) in \neach recent rate case . \n26 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners,  Department Letter, Docket No. E -15/PA -24-198 (July 11, 2025).  \n27 ALJ Report at 33.  \n28 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for the Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners, Letter from Department’s counsel to LPI Counsel (filed as part of ex parte  communication \nbetween PUC staff and LPI), Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (July 18, 2025).  \n29 ALJ Report at 59.  \n8 \n Partners privately negotiated in the HCTS term sheet attached to Witness Bram’s surrebuttal \ntestimony.30  \n \nParagraph 1.27 states that Minnesota Power will file a petition with the Commission within six \nmonths after the close of the Acquisition proposing “to separate non -regulated utility entities from \nthe current ALLETE d/b/a Minnesota Power entity.”31 (Paragraph 1.28 makes a related commitment \ndependent on the outcome of this petition.) It is our understanding that this means ALLETE will file a \nproposal to restructure the company such that Minnesota Power will become its own legal entity, \ndistinct from and subsidiary to ALLETE, Inc. We have mixed feelings on this commitment. On one hand,  \nwe agree (and have long believed) it makes sense for Minnesota Power to be its own legal entity,  \nseparate from ALLETE. On the other hand,  we are frustrated by the timing of this proposal. When the \nCommission first held a special planning meeting  to discuss  the proposed Acquisition in June 2024 , \nCUB asked representatives of the Company if they intended to separate Minnesota Power from ALLETE as part of the proposed Acquisition.\n32 At Chair Sieben’s request, Minnesota Power committed \nto addressing  that issue in their Petition.33 Such a proposal was not included in the Petition, meaning \nparties to this proceeding  have now spent the past year discussing —with the assistance of outside \nexperts paid for providing that  assistance—governance, ring fencing, affiliated interest concerns, etc. \nbased on  the understanding Minnesota Power will continue to be an operating division of ALLETE. If \nthe Commission approves the Acquisition, it would seem an inefficient use of our, other parties’, and \nthe Commission’s resources to reexamine those topics under a reimagined corporate structure  six \nmonths later . It is also discouraging to see that the proposed Settlement appears to leave the door \nopen for the Company to seek rate recovery of transaction costs associated with any holding company petition.\n34 \n \nParagraphs 1.29 and 1.30 refine ALLETE’s prior commitments regarding compliance with \nMinnesota’s affiliated interest regulations.35 Paragraph 1.20 states Minnesota Power will identify any \n \n30 See CUB’s HCTS Reply Brief at 5 -9. \n31 Proposed Settlement  at 6.  \n32 See Minnesota Special Planning Meeting webcast (May 9, 2024) at 48 minutes, available at \nhttps://minnesotapuc.granicus.com/player/clip/2359?view_id=2&redirect=true.  \n33 Id. \n34 See Proposed Settlement at 9 (“Costs associated with any holding company petition or separation efforts will not be \nconsidered transaction or transition costs of the Acquisition and recovery of same shall be considered in any holding \ncompany docket.”)  \n35 Proposed Settlement at 7.  \n9 \n contracts over $500,000 with potential affiliated interests and “notify the Commission within 30 days \nof the execution of each contract not already disclosed to the Commission[.]”36 This is an improvement \nover ALLETE’s prior commitment to take similar actions with respect to contracts over $1 million;  \nhowever, the updated commitments still do not address problems the ALJ  identified about those prior \ncommitments. Namely, the commitments  do not ensure compliance with Minn. Stat. §  216B.48 (which \nrequires reporting of affiliated interest contracts over  $50,000 )37, nor do they “encompass entities \nmanaged or controlled by CPPIB, GIP, BlackRock or the limited partners of GIP Fund V or other GIP \nfunds, ” meaning they do not ensure the “ Commission would be notified of potentially harmful \ntransactions that do not come within the statute’s definition.”38 The Department has not addressed \nhow this commitment resolves the concerns about affiliated interests described in its initial brief:  \n \nThe Partners will hold more than a 5% interest in ALLETE and will be ALLETE’s affiliates under \nthe statute. Any other entities in which the Partners have at least 5% interest also will be \nALLETE’s affiliates. Any contracts between ALLETE and these entities exceeding $50,000 \nrequire Commission approval. Petitioners’ proposed approach does not comply with the \nstatute.39 \n \nFor these reasons, this commitment does not resolve the resolve the new  risks associated with \naffiliated interest transactions created by the Acquisition.  \n \nParagraphs 1.32  states that “ALLETE shall continue to conform its records to the appropriate \nFERC Uniform Accounts pursuant to Minn. R. 7825.0300” and that ALLETE will file accounting entries that record the acquisition.\n40 The value of these commitments are illusory. ALLETE/Minnesota Power  \nwould remain subject to Minn. R. 7825.0300 regardless of making this commitment, and it is unclear \nwhy ALLETE/Minnesota Power  would have any legitimate reason to not file accounting entries as \ndescribed.  \n \nParagraph  1.33 states that the “Partners shall provide the Department and Commission with \naccess to all books and records of the entities up to and including Alloy Parent that are related to \n \n36 Id. \n37 Minn. Stat. § 216B.48 subd. 4.  \n38 ALJ Report at 34 -35. \n39 Department Initial Brief at 42.  \n40 Proposed settlement at 7.  \n10 \n Minnesota Power’s operations under the jurisdiction of the Commission.”41 This is neither  a new nor \na meaningful commitment. The ALJ addressed it in her report by noting :  \n \nALLETE is already required to allow the Commission and the Department to access its books \nand records related to regulated operations. While the Commitment also applies to Alloy \nParent, there is no commitment to provide access to books and records for any entity in the \ncorporate hierarchy above Alloy Parent, even if those book and records relate to regulated \noperations.42 \n \nParagraph 1.34 states “ALLETE and Minnesota Power shall provide access to all documents \nand electronically stored information provided to or by credit rating agencies pertaining to ALLETE up \nto Alloy Parent.”43 While this information may be helpful, it is unclear why it would not be discoverable, \nregardless of the commitment, by the Commission and/or other parties to any general rate case or \nother proceeding where this information is relevant.  \n \nParagraph 1.35 states “ALLETE and the Alloy Parent entities shall maintain the books and \nrecords necessary to allow for an audit of all corporate, affiliate, or subsidiary transactions with Minnesota Power or that result in costs that may be allocable to M innesota Power.”\n44 This may  be a \nhelpful commitment, to the extent it meaningfully allows for such an audit to occur.  \n \nParagraph 1.36  states: “ALLETE shall maintain separate books and records between ALLETE \nand Alloy Parent and make those available to the Commission by request.”45 Relatedly, Paragraph 1.38  \ncommits to providing audited financial statements for Alloy Parent and other Alloy entities.46 The ALJ \npreviously noted : “there is no commitment to provide access to books and records for any entity in \nthe corporate hierarchy above Alloy Parent, even if those book and records relate to regulated \noperations.”47 This commitment would allow for additional access to books and records of other Alloy \nentities on the post -acquisition organization chart, though it remains unclear to us whether (and the \nextent to which) our and others’ concerns about reduced transparenc y would be addressed by this \ncommitment.  \n \n41 Id. \n42 ALJ Report at 39.  \n43 Proposed Settlement at 8.  \n44 Id. \n45 Proposed Settlement at 8.  \n46 Id. \n47 ALJ Report at 39.  \n11 \n  \nParagraphs  1.40 -1.42 address rates and affordability, committing (in various ways) to not pass \n“transaction costs” of the Acquisition through to ratepayers.48 The value of these commitments is \noverstated. It would clearly be harmful to ratepayers if the Company recovered through rates its legal \nfees and other expenses incurred as part of negotiating  the Acquisition and seeking regulatory \napproval for it . Though this commitment arguably reduces that harm, it is, at best, uncertain whether \nthe Commission would allow recovery of such costs whether or not this commitment is made. \nMeanwhile,  these commitments do not account for the substantial premium the Partners will pay to \nacquire ALLETE if the Acquisition is approved. The Partners will need to recover that premium —\nwhether or not they list it as a line item in a rate case—in order to earn a return on their investment.  \n \nParagraph 1.43 states that Minnesota Power waives its right to file a rate case before \nNovember 1, 2026.49 This commitment allows Minnesota Power to continue its recent cadence of filing \na rate case every 2 to 3 years. It is also unclear whether Minnesota Power would have the ability or \nintent, absent this commitment, to file a rate case prior to November 1, 2026 .  \n \nParagraph 1.44 states “Minnesota Power will include a comparison of its requested rate \nincrease and the annual rate of inflation in any general rate case, rider filing, or any other proceeding that would request an increase to residential customer rates.”\n50 While this information may be helpful, \nit is unclear why it would not be discoverable or easily obtainable by the Commission and/or other \nparties to any general rate case, rider filing, or any other proceeding that would request an increase \nto residential  customer rates.  \n \nParagraph 1.45 states “Within 60 days of approval of the Acquisition, Minnesota Power will \nsubmit a plan to the Commission to credit any existing proceeds from the sale of land to ratepayers \nin the form of a bill credit, as identified in Docket No. E015/PA -20-675.51 The plan will include a \nproposal to credit proceeds from all remaining hydro land sales as identified in Docket No. E015/PA -\n20-675. As part of its filing, Minnesota Power shall propose a reasonable revenue apportionment for \n \n48 Proposed Settlement at 9.  \n49 Proposed Settlement at 9.  \n50 Id. \n51 ALJ Report at 9.  \n12 \n consideration during that proceeding.”52 Paragraph 1.46 makes a related commitment.53 In an order \nissued almost four years ago, the Commission authorized Minnesota Power to “defer all proceeds \nfrom the land sales into a regulatory liability that would be refunded (credited) to customers in either \na future rate case or through the Renewable Resources Rider.”54 It seems t hese commitments \naccelerate a credit already owed to customers, but creating the credit is not a new commitment —it is \nhonoring an existing obligation.  For this reason, the Department’s suggestion that the settlement \n“requires Minnesota Power to begin promptly refunding approximately $75.4 million in existing land \nsale proceeds to customers” seems, at best, an incomplete description of “ratepayer savings” created \nby the proposed  Settlement.55 \n \nParagraph 1.56 states: “Minnesota Power will comply with all applicable Minnesota laws under \nthe jurisdiction of Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (includes prevailing wage, not using \ndebarred contractors, etc.).”56 The settling parties have not explained why Minnesota Power would \nnot be  bound to comply with applicable labor laws without this commitment . \n \nParagraph  1.63  address es Minnesota Power’s creation of a Clean Firm Technology Fund that \nwill “only be used to finance Minnesota Power investments in clean firm technology approved by the \n[Commission].”57 This commitment has value in that it adds to the Partners’ more general \ncommitment to provide equity financing to support  ALLETE’s five -year capital plan.  Specifically, it \nseemingly proposes specific installments of additional funding, the projected timing of those \ninstallments, and that the use of those funds are limited to funding “to support these projects but not recovered through rates.“ To be clear, if the Partners honor this commitment, it would be a true \nbenefit to ratepayers. However,  1) though the Commission can order Minnesota Power to create the \nfund, its ability to order the Par tners to provide funding to  Alloy Parent —or to order Alloy Parent to \nmake the committed installments —remains in question; and 2) if the Partner’s do not retain \nownership of ALLETE through 2030 they are unlikely to finance the full $50 million described in this \n \n52 Proposed Settlement at 9.  \n53 Id. \n54 In the Matter of the Petition by Minnesota Power for Approval of Land Sales, Order Allowing Land Sales and Establishing \nConditions, Docket No. E -015/PA -20-265 (Nov. 18, 2021).  \n55 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners, Department Letter, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (July 11, 2025).  \n56 Proposed Settlement at 11.  \n57 Id. \n13 \n commitmen t. For both reasons, the potential benefits associated with this commitment do not \noutweigh the potential harms we and others have described throughout this proceeding.  \n \nParagraphs 1.73  states:  “ALLETE and Partners agree that any failure to achieve any \ncommitment in this Settlement, or to comply with any other condition the Commission places on \napproval of the Acquisition, is a violation of the Commission’s order under Minn. Stat. § 216B.54 and \nis enforceable against the entity from whom the action (or non -action) is required.”58 Relatedly, \nParagraph 1.74 states :  “ALLETE and Partners submit to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and then \nof the courts of the State of Minnesota with respect to any action brought to enforce or resolve a \ndispute arising from an applicable commitment set forth in this Settlement or a  Commission Order \nadopting this Settlement.”59 These statements have limited value in actually ensuring the Commission \nhas the authority to compel the Partners to honor their commitments.  The ALJ found “the Commission \ncannot accept jurisdiction over entities or matters where the legislature has not granted it express authority ,”\n60 and “[t]he Commission may only compel compliance with its orders when the underlying \norder is within its authority.”61 Even if the Commission were to have lawful jurisdiction over the \nPartners, the Commission has limited remedies available to it if  the Partners do not  honor their \ncommitments. As the ALJ noted, the Commission’s primary remedy under Minn. Stat. § 216B.54 is to refer violations of its orders to the Attorney General’s Office and seek penalties of up to $1,000 per violation.\n62 This remedy has little teeth in this context . (E.g.,  if the Partners renege on their \ncommitment to help fund ALLETE’s five -year capital plan it would likely require a lot of $1,000 penalties \nto compel them to do so.) Despite the Partners “submitting” to the jurisdiction of the Commission and \nMinnesota Courts, we remain uncertain that these commitments would allow ALLETE or the Commission to compel  the Partners to honor their  commitments, whether in a future Commission \nproceeding or court action.    \n \n \n \n58 Proposed Settlement at 14.  \n59 Id. \n60 ALJ Report at 65, citing  No Power Line, Inc. v.

The proposed Settlement has not addressed the questions addressed to the \nAdministrative Law Judge in the Commission’s Order of October 7, 2024.  \n \nThe Commission’s October 7, 2024 Order requests record development on seven, specific \nquestions. We list those questions below and discuss whether/how the proposed Settlement \naddresses them.  \n \ni. Are there any potential harms to the public interest from the proposed \ntransaction, including in relation to cost or risk?  \n \nThroughout this proceeding, witnesses and attorneys representing six parties —including the \nDepartment —have introduced evidence of  several  potential harms to the public interest from the \nproposed transaction. As described above, those potential harms include the following:  \n \n• Petitioners have neither established that their deal, as proposed, will produce meaningful \nbenefits, nor have they refuted the foreseeable risks.63 \n \n• The Commission cannot be certain the deal will finance ALLETE’s energy transition, because the final merger agreement contains no binding capital commitment.\n64 \n \n• Even if the Partners do provide capital, their plan to use risky financial strategies could \nfinancially weaken ALLETE —and could dramatically increase rates by 2030.65 \n \n• Despite the deal’s risks to ALLETE’s financial healthy, ratepayers, and the energy transition, \nPetitioners have proposed inadequate governance and ring fencing measures.66 \n \n• Despite their oft -repeated commitment to the regulatory compact, Petitioners have no plans \nto comply with the affiliated -interest statute. Rather, they propose an alternative that would \ndeprive ratepayers of needed statutory protections.67 \n \n \n63 Department Initial Brief at 1.  \n64 Id. \n65 Id. \n66 Id. \n67 Id. at 2. \n15 \n ii. Are there any potential benefits to ratepayers, Minnesota, or the public interest \nfrom the proposed transaction?  \n \n \nThe Settlement includes some benefits to ratepayers, Minnesota, or the public interest. In our \nview, the primary material benefits (that are truly new benefits, not continuations of the status quo) \nare: 1) the commitment to lower Minnesota Power’s ROE, 2) the commitments surrounding the \ncreation of a Clean Firm Technology Fund; and 3)  the commitment to maintain the books and records \nnecessary to allow for an audit of all corporate, affiliate, or subsidiary transactions with Minnesota \nPower or that result in costs that may be allocable to Minnesota Pow er. The Partners’ commitment to \npay down customer arrears (made previously and repeated in the proposed Settlement) is also a \nratepayer benefit . \n \niii. Considering all relevant factors and applicable law, is the proposed transaction \nconsistent with the public interest?  \n \nA large number of the commitments the Petitioners have described throughout this \nproceeding —including those articulated in the proposed Settlement —either commit to maintaining \nthe Company’s status quo or state the Company will comply with Commission orders  and/or legal \nobligations the Company would be required to comply with regardless of the commitments. These commitments do not meaningfully counteract or address the new risks of harm arising from the \nAcquisition for the reasons described above in Section A.  On balance, the potential risks of the \nAcquisition outweigh its potential benefits, meaning it is not consistent with the public interest.  \n \niv. Are there regulatory requirements or commitments necessary to render the \nproposed transaction consistent with the public interest?  \n \nAs the ALJ noted in her Report:  \n \nThe Partners themselves have carefully committed to do very little, instead largely  making \ncommitments through expected holding companies or Minnesota Power itself. A  prime \nexample of this phenomenon is the promised funding of the five -year capital plan.  Access to \ncapital is the primary benefit touted by the Petitioners. However, the Partners have not, in \nfact, promised to provide capital to ALLETE. ALLETE did not even ask for  some commitment to \nprovide equity as part of this merger negotiation and the merg er. \n \nIf the primary benefit of the Acquisition is ensuring ALLETE has access to the capital it needs to comply \nwith the Carbon Free Standard, ALLETE should have asked the Partners to agree, when negotiating \n16 \n the Merger Agreement, to commit to providing that capital. The proposed Settlement similarly \ndemands  no such commitment of the Partners , and so does not address this problem . \n \nv. How do relevant and related dockets pending before the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and/or other \nstate, federal or foreign government agencies impact the Commission’s \nconsideration of the proposed transactio n? \n \nIt is our understanding that the Commission’s approval is the final regulatory approval needed \nfor the Acquisition to close. For that reason, the  proposed Settlement neither  impact s, nor is not \nimpacted, by proceedings occurring in other jurisdictions. That being said, we recommend the \nCommission consider FERC Chairman Christie ’s statements about the role utility regulators should \nplay in protecting ratepayers from growing influence and power wielded by private equity firms in the \nregulated utility space:  \n \n[P]ublic utilities that provide electrical power to retail customers are usually holders of a state-\ngranted monopoly franchise that comes with various public service obligations, such as \nproviding reliable power service at rates that are just and reasonabl e.  . . . [I]t is absolutely \nessential for regulators to make sure that the interests of investors do not conflict with the public service obligations that a utility has.  And yes, there is a potential conflict. That potential \nconflict requires heightened regulatory scrutiny when huge investment companies and asset \nmanagers, as well as large private equity funds, which individually and collectively direct \nliterally trillions of dollars in capital, appear to be acting not as passive investors simply seeking \nthe best risk- based returns for their own clients, but instead appear to be actively using their \ninvestment power to affect how the utility meets its own public service obligations.\n68 \n \nvi. How will the acquisition impact Minnesota Power’s union and non- union \nworkforce and do the protections included in the acquisition adequately \nprotect that workforce?  \n \nAccording to the Department’s letter accompanying the Settlement:  \n \nThe settlement memorializes Petitioners’ commitment to maintain the same or better position \nand compensation for ALLETE’s nonunion employees and all existing collective bargaining \n \n68 E-1: Commissioner Christie’s Concurrence to Federal Power Act Section 203 Blanket Authorization Notice of Inquiry: E -1, \nAD24 -6 (Dec. 19, 2023), available at https://www.ferc.gov/news -events/news/e -1-commissioner -christies- concurrence -federal -\npower -act-section-203- blanket  \n17 \n agreements with its union employees for the next two years.9 It also describes ALLETE’s \ncommitment to execute a neutrality agreement with IBEW Local 31.10 .69 \n \nIt is our understanding that the proposed Settlement does not contain new commitments (i.e., \ncommitments that were not previously included in the Company’s filings) designed to specifically \nimpact Minnesota Power’s union and non -union workforce.  \n \nvii. How will the acquisition impact Minnesota Power's ability to comply with the \ncarbon- free standard under Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, including any \nmodifications of plans associated with the Nemadji Trail Energy Center (NTEC)  \n \nThe legislation imposing the Carbon Free Standard requires the Commission to “maximize net \nbenefits” to Minnesotans when implementing that standard. For the reasons discussed above, it is at \nbest unclear whether the proposed Settlement meets this objective. The proposed Settlement does \nnot appear to address any modifications of plans associated with NTEC. It is also unclear whether/how \nthe Acquisition (with or without the proposed Settlement) will otherwise improve the Company’s \nability to meet the Carbon F ree Standard. If the Acquisition is approved, the Company would give up \ntheir access to the public markets to instead rely solely on the Partners for their equity capital needs. \nThe Partners have not made any legally enforceable commitment to provide equit y capital to ALLETE. \nEven if the Partners honor their non -enforceable commitments (e.g., financing ALLETE’s five -year \ncapital plan and providing $50 million to the Clean Firm Technology Fund) those commitments expire \nwell before 2040.  \n \nC. The Acquisition proposal as modified by the Settlement agreement do not \nprovide adequate or lasting  protections to low -income customers and \ncustomers from marginalized communities . \n The proposed Settlement reiterates (1)  Minnesota Power’s commitment to not request a \nreduction to the CARE budget or eligibility requirements and (2) the Partners ’ commitment  to pay \ndown arrears so that they are reduced to pre -COVID levels.\n70 As we stated in our briefs, CUB strongly \nsupports the CARE program and appreciates these commitments.  However, because the CARE \nprogram is a ratepayer -funded program, any changes to its budget or eligibility requirements would \n \n69 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners,  Department Letter, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (July 11, 2025) , citing Proposed Settlement at 1.58 –  \n1.60.  \n70 Proposed Settlement at 8 -9. \n18 \n need to be approved by the Commission. Also, the Partner’s offer to pay down arrears, while helpful \nin the short term for some Minnesota Power customers, does not prevent ratepayers from newly \nfalling behind on their bills —particularly if their rates incre ase dramatically following approval of the \nAcquisition.  \n \nD. The conditions included in the Proposed Settlement do not resolve CUB’s \nconcerns. \n \nAfter reviewing the comprehensive record built in the contested case proceeding, and \nconsidering the proposed Settlement, the ALJ concluded approval of the Acquisition would cause net harm to Minnesotans. We agree. Though some of the additional conditions proposed in the proposed \nSettlement are helpful, they fall short of addressing the concerns we and others have raised on this \nrecord and that inform the ALJ’s determination.  \n \nE. Other issues or concerns related to this matter . \n \nSome might suggest that we and others overstate our concerns about enforceability. We \nstrongly disagree. This entire acquisition is premised on ALLETE’s need for improved access to capital. \nLikewise, the most significant potential benefit of the Acquisitio n is the Partners providing that needed \ncapital. If, for any reason, the Partners become unable or unwilling to provide the capital they’ve \ncommitted to provide to ALLETE, then the whole purpose and potential value of the Acquisition is lost. Likewise, the value of any of the Partners’ commitments included in the proposed Settlement is \ncompromised if the Partners face no material consequences for refusing to honor them after the Acquisition is approved. As the ALJ noted, “Once approved, the Commission cannot unapprove th e \nAcquisition.”\n71 The ALJ also questioned the Partners’ credibility.72 For both reasons, it is imperative \nthat the Commission determine now the limits of its jurisdiction over Alloy Parent and the Partners \nand what remedies the Commission has available to compel those entities to honor their \ncommitments , if needed. Respectfully, we believe it would be helpful for the Commission’s internal \nlegal staff to review and advise the Commission on these issues.  \n \n \n \n71 ALJ Report at 73, citing Minn. Stat. §§ 216B.54- 61 (2024).  \n72 Id. at 73, FN 605.  \n19 \n II. CONCLUSION  \n \nOn balance, the risks of potential harm arising from the Acquisition outweigh its potential \nbenefits.  The proposed Settlement does not reset that balance.  Therefore, the Acquisition is not \nconsistent with the public interest, and the Commission should deny its approval.   \n \nDated: August  4, 202 5      Respectfully submitted,  \n         \n       /s/ Brian C.

E015/PA-24-198 and E015/M-24-383  \nCAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339  \nDear Mr. Bull:  \nALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power (“Minnesota Power” or the “Company”), the \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPPIB”), and Global Infrastructure Partners \n(“GIP”) (collectively, the “Petitioners”), hereby submit comments in response to the \nNotice of Schedule for Exceptions to the ALJ Report and the Notice of Comment Period \non the Proposed Settlement, each issued on July 18, 2025 in the above-referenced \nDocket. Overall, Petitioners Petitioners request that the Commission approve the \nAcquisition and Settlement reached with the Department.  \nPetitioners’ respectfully submit that the Commission should reject the substantive \nfindings, conclusions, and recommendations from the ALJ Report (“Report”) for two \nreasons. First, the recommendations and findings in the Report do not reflect the \nsubstantial evidence in the record, but rather are a one-sided, near verbatim adoption of \nthe substantive proposed findings of parties opposing the Acquisition. As such, and for \nthe additional reasons set forth in the Petitioners’ Exceptions, the Report does not \npresent a fair and reasonable analysis on which the Commission can rely.  \nSecond, the July 11, 2025 Settlement Stipulation (“Settlement Agreement” or \n“Settlement”) reached between the Petitioners and the Minnesota Department of \nCommerce presents substantial additional commitments not meaningfully addressed in \nthe ALJ Report that both provide additional benefits to Minnesota Power customers and \nthe public, and address concerns expressed in the record of this proceeding. Whether \nvia disagreement with the ALJ Report, or due to the Settlement Agreement – or a \ncombination of both – Petitioners request that the Commission approve the Acquisition, \nas well as the underlying Settlement Agreement.  \n  \nThe Minnesota Public Utilities Commission  \nAugust 4, 2025  \nPage 2   \n  In these Exceptions, Petitioners explain the basis for approving the Acquisition \nand rejecting the substantive portions of the Report. Given the complexity of the factual \nrecord, Petitioners include in their Exceptions a series of Attachments as tools to assist \nthe Commission in its review.  \n Attachment A: Key Issues Table  \nThis document provides cross-references between the issues in this record to \nthe location where each topic is addressed and resolved in the record and the \nSettlement. Because the Report does not fully or accurately reflect the \nevidence and arguments of the Petitioners or other parties supporting the \nAcquisition, this resource is intended to serve as a reference that will assist \nreviewers in finding the relevant information.  \n Attachment B: Petitioners and Department’s Joint Redlines to \nSection  III.C of Report  \nThe Report includes findings related to the commitments offered by the \nPetitioners during the contested case process.1 These findings do not include \nan accurate summary of the record and reach the wrong conclusions about \nthe value of the commitments (typically without record citations); they also do \nnot incorporate the additional value provided by the new commitments in the \nSettlement.  Accordingly, Attachment B provides redlines of each commitment \nto better reflect their value, and modifies findings where necessary to reflect \nchanges resulting from the Settlement Agreement. Additionally, Attachment B \nproposes new findings to address each additional commitment added via the \nSettlement.  \n Attachment C: Comparison of Acquisition Financial Benefits to Other \nTransactions Identified by Opposing Parties  \nOpposing parties, and the Report, suggested that the financial commitments \noffered by the Petitioners were not comparable to those of other utility \ntransactions that have been approved.  Attachment C demonstrates that the \nfinancial benefits of the Acquisition, as updated through the Settlement \nAgreement, in fact meet or materially exceed those of comparable \ntransactions.  \nPetitioners are providing additional attachments because the Report does not \nreflect the substantial evidence in the record independent of the Settlement Agreement. \nTo underscore this fundamental fact and further aid Commission review, Petitioners \nprovide the following additional material:  \n \n1 See Report, Findings 139 through 178 \nThe Minnesota Public Utilities Commission  \nAugust 4, 2025  \nPage 3   \n   Attachment D: Petitioners’ Update of Joint Proposed Findings  \nBecause it is not feasible, and likely unhelpful, for the Petitioners to attempt to \nredline every finding in the ALJ Report, Petitioners provide Attachment D, as \nwell as the redlined findings in Attachment B, so that the Commission has \nalternative and more balanced findings available to it. The proposed findings \nin Attachment D are updated from the original Joint Findings of the parties \nwho supported the Acquisition, with modifications or updates to help ensure \nthat they are a balanced description of the record. Petitioners do not expect \nthat the Commission will adopt these findings in full but offer them as a \nresource to assist in decision-making. These findings do not independently \naddress the Settlement Agreement.  \n Attachment E: Redline Comparison of Opposing Parties’ Joint Findings \nto ALJ Report  \nThis is a redline comparison of the Report to the substantive proposed \nfindings of the parties who opposed the Acquisition, demonstrating that they \nare identical or nearly identical in virtually all material respects.  \nWhen fairly evaluated, the record demonstrates that the Acquisition is not only \nconsistent with the public interest under Minn. Stat. §  216B.50, but critical for Minnesota \nPower to satisfy Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard. Consistent with the issues \npresented in the Commission’s July 18, 2025 Notices on Exceptions and the \nSettlement, the record also demonstrates that the issues set forth in the Commission’s \nOctober 7, 2024 Order have been addressed such that the Acquisition should be \napproved. Conversely, the substantive findings, recommendations, and conclusions in \nthe Report should be rejected as inconsistent with Minn. Stat. § 216B.50.   \nIn addition, the Settlement between the Department of Commerce and \nPetitioners is consistent with the public interest under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50. The \nSettlement also provides appropriate and indeed substantial protections and benefits, \nincluding to low-income customers and customers from marginalized communities, and \nno additional conditions need to be imposed to approve the Acquisition.   \n Accordingly, the Petitioners request that the Commission find that the \nAcquisition and Settlement Agreement are consistent with the public interest and should \nbe approved.   \n  \nThe Minnesota Public Utilities Commission  \nAugust 4, 2025  \nPage 4   \n  Please feel free to contact the undersigned with any questions.    \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \n \nElizabeth M.

INTRODUCTION \nALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power,1 Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP \nInvestments”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP” and, together, “the Partners” and, \ncollectively with the Company, “the Petitioners”) respectfully submit these exceptions to the \nJuly 15, 2025, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendations (the “Report”)2 of \nAdministrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) Megan J. McKenzie (the “Exceptions”).  \nThe Petitioners request the Commission approve the acquisition of ALLETE, Inc. by CPP \nInvestments and GIP (“the Acquisition”) consistent with the Settlement Stipulation (which \nincludes all commitments previously made by the Petitioners) between the Petitioners and the \nDepartment filed on July 11, 2025 (the “Settlement”).3  \nThe Commission should reject the substantive findings, conclusions, and recommendations \nin the Report for two reasons. First, as explained in these Exceptions, the Report is not an accurate \nor balanced summary or analysis of the record. The Report does not even attempt to provide a \nmeaningful discussion of the evidence, arguments, and counterarguments presented by the \nPetitioners and other parties that support the Acquisition, including Laborers International Union \nof North America – Minnesota and North Dakota (“LIUNA”), International Union of Operating \nEngineers Local 49 (“IUOE Local 49”), North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters \n(“NCSRCC”), and Energy CENTS Coalition (“Energy CENTS”). In fact, the Report was adopted \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout these Exceptions, “Minnesota \nPower” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically defined, references to \n“ALLETE” indicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota Power and all regulated and \nnon-regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power. \n2 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment \nBoard and Global Infrastructure Partners , Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and \nRecommendations (July 15, 2025) (eDocket Nos. 20257-221020-01 ; 20257-221061-02 (HCTS)). \n3 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Settlement Stipulation Between the Minnesota Department of Commerce, ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Global Infrastructure Partners  (July 11, \n2025) (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n \n2 nearly wholesale from the one-sided proposed findings filed by Opposing Parties,4 which ignored \nand did not explain most of the evidence and arguments presented by the Petitioners. As a result, \nthe Report presents only the portions of the record developed by parties that oppose the \nAcquisition. The Report does not provide an accurate account of the record and does not reflect \nthe application of independent judgment that the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission \n(“Commission”) can rely on. When the entire record is properly evaluated, it is clear that the \nAcquisition is consistent with the public interest and should be approved. \nSecond, the Report does not meaningfully evaluate the substantial benefits of the \nAcquisition as cemented by the Settlement reached with the Department. Instead, the Report \ndismisses the Settlement and fails to evaluate how each component of the Settlement addresses \nconcerns about the Acquisition and provides substantial and demonstrable benefits to Minnesota \nPower’s customers, Minnesota Power’s stakeholders, the State of Minnesota, and the public \ninterest. The Petitioners have worked continuously with the Department throughout this \nproceeding to explore disputed issues and develop commitments to ensure the Acquisition is \nconsistent with the public interest. After months of directed effort, the Petitioners and the \nDepartment filed a Settlement on July 11, 2025, and the Department now joins with the Petitioners \nand other supporting parties5 in recommending approval of the Acquisition, with the additional \ncommitments provided in the Settlement.  \nThe additional commitments include rate reductions as a result of a reduced return on \nequity (“ROE”); a rate case stay-out; new service quality performance metrics and penalties; a \n$50 million non-recoverable clean firm grant program; and additional protections to ensure the \n \n4 The “Opposing Parties” are comprised of the Office of the Attorney General (“OAG”), Citizens Utility Board \n(“CUB”), Clean Up the River Environment (“CURE”), Sierra Club, and Large Power Intervenors (“LPI”). \n5 LIUNA, IUOE Local 49, NCSRCC, and Energy CENTS. \n \n3 financial health of Minnesota Power and that the commitments are meaningful and enforceable.6 \nThese commitments resolve the concerns raised in the Report and add substantial additional \nbenefits for Minnesota Power customers. Given the timing of when the Settlement was reached, \nthe Report did not have the benefit of reasoned evaluation of the new commitments.7 While the \nAcquisition is in the public interest even without the Settlement, when the additional commitments \nin the Settlement are properly evaluated, in combination with the previous commitments made by \nPetitioners, they demonstrate that the Acquisition is clearly consistent with the public interest and \nshould be approved.8 \nII. THE REPORT FAILS TO PROVIDE A BALANCED AND ACCURATE \nACCOUNT OF THE RECORD AND ADOPTS THE WRONG STANDARD OF \nREVIEW. \nThe Commission is responsible for deciding all cases, including this one, based on the \nrecord as a whole.9 As explained by the Minnesota Supreme Court, agency decision-makers must \n“make their own ‘independent decisions and not . . . rubber stamp the findings of a hearing \nexaminer.’”10 The fundamental purpose of a report from an ALJ is to provide a complete account \nand analysis of the full record so that the Commission can exercise its independent judgment and \nfulfill its ultimate decision-making responsibility. The Report in this case failed to do so. \n \n6 Settlement at 1.14, 1.43, 1.64, 1.63, 1.73, 1.3–1.8, 1.74 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n7 Report at 67, n. 549 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n8 The Commission’s Notice of Comment Period on the Proposed Settlement requested that commenters separate their \nfilings regarding the exceptions and the Settlement to the extent practical. It is not practical for the Petitioners to \nseparate these two issues because the additional commitments provided in the Settlement are directly responsive to \nthe Report and evaluating them is necessary to understand why the findings and recommendations in the Report are \ninaccurate and incorrect. Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Notice of Comment Period on the Proposed Settlement at 1 \n(July 18, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257-221154-01 ). \n9 Commission decisions must be supported by substantial evidence and must not be arbitrary and capricious. Minn. \nStat. § 14.69; see also  Minn. Stat. § 14.62, subd. 1 (requiring, in contested cases, that the final decision “shall be based \non the record and shall include the agency’s findings of fact and conclusions on all material issues ”) (emphasis added). \n10 In re Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minn. , 624 N.W.2d 264, 274 (Minn. 2001) (quoting \nCity of Moorhead v. Minn. Pub. Utils. Comm’n , 343 N.W.2d 843, 846 (Minn. 1984)). \n \n4 The Report is deficient because it does not provide a balanced and accurate account of the \nrecord. Instead, it provides a one-sided account of one perspective on the Acquisition, often \ncompletely ignoring or trivializing the evidence and arguments provided by the Petitioners and \nother Parties that support the Acquisition. The reason that the Report is so one-sided is that it was \nadopted nearly word-for-word from the Proposed Findings of the Opposing Parties,11 which did \nnot accurately represent the evidence and arguments of the Petitioners or other Parties that support \nthe Acquisition. As a result, the Report is deficient and does not provide a reasonable basis for the \nCommission to make a decision.  \nWhile the Commission routinely accepts, adopts and incorporates the findings, \nconclusions, and recommendations of an ALJ Report except where it is inconsistent with the \nCommission’s decision,12 this Report is so deficient that the Petitioners cannot meaningfully \nrecommend individual changes to the Report that could make it accurate. Instead, it must be \nrejected. To assist the Commission’s review given the failings in the Report, Petitioners provide \nAttachments A, B, and D.13 In addition to providing these resources, this section explains the \nReport’s inadequacies. \n \n11 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Joint Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations of the \nPublic Interest Intervenors (May 29, 2025) (eDocket No.  20255-219380-01 ). \n12 See, e.g. , In the Matter of the Applications of Xcel Energy for a Certificate of Need and Route Permit for the \nMinnesota Energy Connection Project in Sherburne, Stearns, Kandiyohi, Wright, Meeker, Chippewa, Yellow \nMedicine, Renville, Redwood, and Lyon counties in Minnesota , Docket Nos. E002/CN-22-131, E002/TL-22-132, \nORDER MODIFYING AND ADOPTING ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE REPORT , GRANTING CERTIFICATE OF NEED, AND \nISSUING ROUTE PERMIT FOR THE MINNESOTA ENERGY CONNECTION PROJECT  at 5 (June 11, 2025) (eDocket No. \n20256-219826-01 ). \n13 Attachment A is a table identifying the issues described inaccurately in the Report and providing 1) citations to \nrecord evidence from the Petitioners that were not included in the Report; and 2) commitments that specifically address \nthe concerns in, but which were not properly evaluated in, the Report. Attachment B is a redline of the Report’s \nfindings specifically related to the Commitments offered during the contested case process. Attachment D represents \nadditional findings related to the overall record. These findings have been updated from the Proposed Findings filed \njointly by Petitioners, LIUNA, IUOE Local 49, NCSRCC, and Energy CENTS. Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Joint \nProposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation to Approve the Acquisition (May 29, 2025) \n(“Joint Reply Brief”) (eDocket No. 20255-219382-02 ). \n \n5 A. The Report is Copied from the Opposing Parties’ Proposed Findings Nearly \nWord-For-Word. \nThe Commission refers matters for contested case hearings when material facts are in \ndispute,14 and it relies on such hearings to develop the factual record and produce a report \nsummarizing and analyzing the complex records that are developed. When the Commission \nreferred this matter to the Court of Administrative Hearings, it did so specifically “ to develop the \nrelevant facts of this matter .”15 According to the rules of the Court of Administrative Hearings, \nALJs assigned to contested case hearings must “make a complete record” and “prepare findings of \nfact.”16 While ALJ reports provide a recommendation, the primary purpose of the report is to \nprovide a complete, accurate summary of the record so that the Commissioners can apply their \nown judgment and make fully informed decisions on important policy questions.17 \nThat is not what happened here. Instead of summarizing the record, weighing the evidence \nand applying independent judgment, the Report’s substantive findings are copied almost entirely \nfrom the Proposed Findings filed by the Opposing Parties on every issue . The Report ignores or \nsummarily dismisses without meaningful analysis the filings, evidence and arguments of the \nPetitioners and every other party that supports the Acquisition.  \nPetitioners have prepared a redline document, included as Attachment E, comparing the \nsubstantive factual findings and conclusions in the Report to the proposed findings of the Opposing \nParties filed on May 29, 2025.18 A casual comparison of the Report to Opposing Parties’ findings \n \n14 Minn. R. 7829.1000. \n15 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, O RDER REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND GRANTING INTERVENTION , AND \nNOTICE OF AND ORDER FOR HEARING  at 2 (Oct. 7, 2024) (eDocket No.  202410-210754-01 ) (emphasis added). In 2025, \nthe name of the Office of Administrative Hearings was changed to the Court of Administrative Hearings. \n16 Minn. R. 1400.5500. \n17 See In re Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minn. , 624 N.W.2d at 274 (quoting City of \nMoorhead , 343 N.W.2d at 846). \n18 Attachment E was created by using a software program to compare the Proposed Findings filed by the Opposing \nParties on May 29, 2025 with the substantive findings and conclusions of the Report. To create the comparison, the \n \n \n6 shows they are similar, but the more detailed comparison in Attachment E shows they are nearly \nidentical.19 The vast majority of the substantive findings and conclusions in the Report are copied \nfrom the Opposing Parties’ proposed findings with minor non-substantive editorial changes. \nThe Report fails to provide a summary and analysis of the entire record and does not \ninclude independently developed findings and conclusions. Instead, the Report was effectively \nwritten by the parties that oppose the Acquisition and functionally ignores the evidence and \narguments that do not fit their preferred outcome. Making a decision based only on part of the \nrecord, while ignoring the rest, is a clear sign of arbitrary decision-making. As a result, the \nCommission cannot rely on the findings, conclusions, or recommendation in this Report. \nB. Many Court Decisions Recognize that Copying Findings from One Side Can \nShow a Lack of Independent Judgment. \nMinnesota courts have strongly cautioned that “wholesale adoption of one party’s findings \nand conclusions raises the question of whether the [court] independently evaluated each party’s \ntestimony and evidence.”20 Courts require that a decision-maker “must scrupulously assure that \nfindings and conclusions – whether they be the court’s alone, one or the other party’s, or a \ncombination – are always detailed, specific and sufficient enough to enable meaningful review by \n \nPetitioners compared the substantive findings in the Report (beginning at Section II, Background) with the substantive \nfindings in the Opposing Parties’ proposed findings (beginning at Section I, Background on page 8). The comparison \nfocuses on the factual findings and conclusions, the part of the Report that is most meaningful. \n19 Some of the findings that were copied contained errors that are easily identifiable if the underlying exhibits are \nreviewed, while others included obvious typographical errors in the underlying document. For example, the Opposing \nParties had certain basic details wrong about the amount and timing, respectively, of investments associated with \nfootnotes 109 and 110 of the Report, but the Report failed to identify the errors and simply copied over the mistakes. \nFurther, on pages 13 and 14 of the Opposing Parties’ proposed findings, paragraph 25 includes a typographical error \nsuch that the footnotes are not sequentially numbered – footnote 54 is followed by footnote 71 – and footnote 54 does \nnot appear to cite to anything. The exact same typographical error is included in the Report. In Report Paragraph 74, \nthe footnotes are also not sequentially numbered – footnote 54 is followed by footnote 114 – and footnote 54 does not \nappear to cite to anything. In short, the Report copied the Opposing Parties’ proposed findings so directly that it did \nnot even correct obvious errors. \n20 Bliss v. Bliss , 493 N.W.2d 583, 590 (Minn. Ct. App. 1992); see also  City View Apartments v. Sanchez , No. C2-00-\n313, 2000 WL 1064897 at *2 (Minn. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2000); Johnson v. Commissioner of Pub. Safety , No. C7-95-\n470, 1995 WL 465351 at *3 (Minn. Ct. App. Aug. 8, 1995);  Lundquist v. Lundquist , No. C0-94-509, 1994 WL 510168 \n(Minn. Ct. App. Sept. 20, 1994).  \n \n7 this court.”21 Adopting the proposed findings of one party suggests that “independent evaluation \nof the evidence” did not take place, and has caused courts “to call for more careful scrutiny of \nadopted findings.”22 \nMore specifically, the Minnesota Supreme Court has held: \n[T]he United States Supreme Court criticized the practice of courts adopting \nverbatim the findings prepared by the prevailing party, particularly if the findings \n‘have taken the form of conclusory statements unsupported by citation to the \nrecord.’ As the Eighth Circuit explained in Bradley v. Maryland Casualty Co ., the \nproblem with verbatim adoption of one party’s findings is that it can make it more \ndifficult to determine whether a court exercised its ‘own careful consideration of \nthe evidence, of the witnesses, and of the entire case.’ We agree that it is preferable \nfor a court to independently develop its own findings. Therefore, when we review \na court’s verbatim adoption of one party’s proposed findings, we will heed how the \nfindings were prepared when we conduct a careful and searching review of the \nrecord.23  \n \nThe Minnesota Court of Appeals has further recognized that “[f]ederal cases have uniformly \ndisapproved of this practice [‘verbatim adoption of one set of proposed findings and conclusions \nof law’] as a dereliction of the trial court’s function . . . .24 Appellate courts “deserve[] the assurance \n[given by ‘even-handed consideration of the evidence of both parties’] that the trial court has come \nto grips with apparently irreconcilable conflicts in the evidence . . . and has distilled therefrom true \nfacts in the crucible of his conscience.”25 This is even more true here because, unlike in appellate \n \n21Bliss , 493 N.W.2d at 590. \n22 Mayview Corp. v.

Bank of Richmond , \n467 U.S. 867 (1984); Hosley v. Armour & Co. , 683 F.2d 864, 866 (4th Cir. 1982)). Nearly identical to Minn. R. Civ. \nP. 52.01, Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) states that “In an action tried on the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the \ncourt must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately.” As noted previously, Minn. Stat. § \n14.62 requires the same or more detail for findings of fact, conclusions, and recommendations in an ALJ report. \n25 Golf City, Inc. v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., Inc. , 555 F.2d 426, 435 (5th Cir. 1977). \n \n8 situations where the trial court is afforded deference, the Commission does not owe deference to \nthe Report and must make the decision for itself.26   \nFederal courts have taken a similar view. The United States Supreme Court has stated that \nthe adoption of findings proposed by one party “leave much to be desired.”27 The Third Circuit \nhas stated that “findings must be based on something more than a one-sided presentation of the \nevidence.”28 Likewise, the Fourth Circuit explained that a tribunal reviewing such heavily and \nuniformly adopted findings will “‘feel slightly more confident in concluding that important \nevidence has been overlooked and inadequately considered’ when factual findings were not the \nproduct of personal analysis and determination by the trial judge.”29 Those concerns are a \nparticular problem where “a cursory reading of the [court’s findings/memorandum] leaves one \nwith the impression that it was indeed written by the prevailing party to a bitter dispute.”30 As \nsuch, courts have routinely “cautioned against the practice of adopting . . . the prevailing party’s \nproposed findings and conclusions . . . . The adversarial tone of such findings accords them less \nweight and dignity [than] . . . the unfettered and independent judgment of the trial judge.”31 \nThe Petitioners do not suggest that the fact that the Report is copied from the Opposing \nParties would necessarily mean, on its own, that the Report is invalid. It is, however, clearly \ndisfavored by the Courts. And while not every case cited above reversed the trial court, the practice \nof simply adopting one set of findings (in whole or in most respects) has been universally \n \n26 In the Matter of the Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minnesota , 624 N.W.2d at 278 (holding \nthat agencies “owe[] no deference to any party in an administrative proceeding, nor to the findings, conclusions, or \nrecommendations of the ALJ.”). \n27 U.S. v.

It is a “danger signal” suggesting that a “hard look” has not been taken, which Courts \nhave identified is a sign of arbitrary and capricious decision-making.32 In a matter of such \nsignificant public interest, it is critical that the Commission take a hard look at all of the evidence, \nand that the Commission’s decision be free from danger signals. It is not possible to do so while \nrelying on the Report because, as described in more detail below, the Opposing Parties’ proposed \nfindings tell only one side of the evidence, and do not provide a balanced or accurate summary of \nthe record.  \nFor all these reasons, the Commission must reject the findings and conclusions in the \nReport, evaluate the whole record, and approve the Acquisition because it is consistent with the \npublic interest. \nC. The Report Reflects a Completely One-Sided Account of the Record. \nIn addition to the overall problems with copying the proposed findings of the Opposing \nParties, in this case it is particularly egregious because the Opposing Parties did not provide an \naccurate and comprehensive summary of the record. The proposed findings of the Opposing \nParties, copied by the Report, present only one perspective on the Acquisition. They focus on \narguments against the Acquisition and ignore evidence and arguments on the other side. The \nfollowing examples, which are only a small subset of the areas in which the Report is deficient, \nmake clear that the Report provides only one side of the record. \n1. Capital Investment Forecast \nIn Finding 128, the Report states “ALLETE has consistently overestimated its capital needs \neach year since 2019,” suggesting that capital forecasts have been overstated by [NOT PUBLIC \nDATA BEGINS …  … NOT PUBLIC DATA \n \n32 Matter of Denial of Contested Case Hearing Requests , 993 N.W.2d 627, 660 (Minn. 2023). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT\nTRADE SECRET DATA EXCISED\n \n10 ENDS] .33 This finding was copied word-for-word from the Opposing Parties’ proposed findings.34 \nAnd, just like the Opposing Parties, the Report ignores the unrefuted counterevidence produced \nby the Petitioners that the variance for ALLETE’s regulated capital expenditures forecasts for \nMinnesota Power – the primary focus of this proceeding – have averaged five percent to nine \npercent.    \nSpecifically, Finding 128 describes ALLETE’s total-company forecasts, while the more \nappropriate and proper focus is the regulated utility. Though not reflected in the Report, Minnesota \nPower Witness Taran testified that the variance in the Company’s regulated capital expenditures \nforecast is far lower than indicated in the Report.35 Witness Taran also provided specific evidence \nto substantiate this testimony, which demonstrates that the average variance in regulated capital \nexpenditures is only nine percent, or $18 million per year.36 Witness Taran further explained that \nthe data set is impacted by an outlier year during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and that when \ncontrolling for the pandemic year, the average variance in regulated capital spending is only five \npercent.37  \nThe Report does not mention the Petitioners’ evidence, let alone weigh it against the \nOpposing Parties’ evidence or provide any reasoned basis for reaching the conclusion in Finding \n128 without analysis of the counterevidence. The evidence produced by Witness Taran was \nignored, and as a result the Report does not provide an accurate account of the record on this issue. \n \n33 Report at ¶ 128 (eDocket No. 20257-221061-02) (HCTS). \n34 See Attachment E at 22. \n35 Ex. MP-29 at 13 (Taran Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-05 ). \n36 Id. \n37 Id. \n \n11 2. Over-Reliance on Power Purchase Agreements \nAs a further example of one-sided flaws in the Report, Finding 125 states that “ALLETE \ncould reduce capital needs by making greater use of power purchase agreements (”PPAs“) to \nreduce capital spending on self-built generation.”38 Other than a grammatical change, this finding \nis copied word-for-word from the Opposing Parties’ proposed findings.39 Reading the Report alone \nleaves the impression that the record includes some analysis that PPAs could meaningfully reduce \ncapital needs, and that the Petitioners did not even dispute this issue – but neither of those \nimplications is true. Opposing Parties provided no analysis or quantification of whether PPAs are \na viable option to reduce capital spending, how many PPAs would be needed, or how that would \naffect customer rates. By contrast, the Partners provided the following arguments and evidence \nregarding the use of PPAs, none of which are referenced much less discussed or refuted in the \nReport: \n The Petitioners presented evidence showing that approximately 40 percent of the five-\nyear capital plan is for transmission investments, which do not involve PPAs.40 \n The Petitioners explained that the capital expenditure forecast already assumes the \ninclusion of PPAs for generation resources. Specifically, the capital forecast assumes \nthat 50 percent of the pending Request for Proposals (“RFP”) for 400 MW of wind will \nbe met through PPAs, and that PPAs are expected to provide the majority of solar \ncapacity after the inclusion of the Boswell Solar and Regal Solar projects,41 which were \napproved by the Commission on May 13, 2025.42 \n The Petitioners explained that capital expenditure plans need to recognize – and prepare \nfinancing for – the possibility that third-party projects do not arise, and that it would be \n \n38 Report at ¶ 125 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n39 Attachment E at 21. \n40 Ex.

Instead, the Report includes a conclusory \nstatement about PPAs, taken solely from Opposing Parties’ proposed findings, and ignores the rest \nof these arguments and evidence without providing any basis for doing so.48  \n3. The Upper Peninsula Power Company Transaction \nThe Report includes six findings about Upper Peninsula Power Company (“UPPCO”), a \nsmall utility that was acquired in 2014.49 The findings describe issues that were raised during and \nafter the UPPCO acquisition, and the Report concludes that “[g]iven the similarities between \nALLETE and UPPCO, the Administrative Law Judge finds that the private-equity model offered \n \n43 Evid.

Report at ¶ 125 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n49 Report at ¶¶ 229–234 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n \n13 by the Partners is not in the public interest.”50 Other than grammatical changes, the findings related \nto UPPCO and the conclusion about its impact were copied directly from the Proposed Findings \nfiled by the Opposing Parties.51 \nThe Report does not include any reference to the evidence and arguments Petitioners \nprovided about UPPCO. This omission is particularly egregious, because Petitioner Witness John \nQuackenbush was the chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission and personally presided \nover the UPPCO proceedings in question. Neither this fact, nor Witness Quackenbush’s testimony \non the issue, is referenced at all in the Report. Witness Quackenbush testified that UPPCO’s rate \nproblems “pre-existed” the transaction and were caused by “lack of density of its relatively small \nrural service territory.”52 Witness Quackenbush further explained the concerns about UPPCO: \n[W]ere either routine, one-off, and/or not applicable to ALLETE’s next rate case. . \n. . I would not characterize any of the . . . UPPCO issues as concerns for the \nMinnesota PUC in subsequent Minnesota Power rate cases, let alone this \nproceeding as they are all non-issues as the Commission evaluates whether to \napprove the Acquisition.53  \n \nWitness Quackenbush’s testimony is relevant and credible, given his personal involvement as a \ncommissioner who presided over the matters at issue, but the Report does not even reference it, \nmuch less explain why the Report reaches the opposite conclusion. \n \n50 Id. at ¶ 234. The Report also includes a footnote, again copied from the Opposing Parties’ proposed findings, \nasserting that the TXU/Energy Future Holdings acquisition in 2007 is “[a]nother cautionary tale.” Id. at ¶ 234, n. 487. \nThe Report makes no reference to fundamental differences with the TXU acquisition analyzed by the Petitioners, \nincluding that the TXU acquisition, even as described by CURE Witness Baker, “was among ‘the largest leveraged \nbuyouts in history,’ premised on a ‘bet’ that the acquiror could profit from affiliated merchant generation” in a \nderegulated market. Partner Initial Post-Hearing Brief at 64, 94 (May 1, 2025) (eDocket No. 20255-218522-01 ) \n(quoting Ex. CURE-600 at 10–12 (Baker Direct) (Docket No. 20252-214963-04 )). The TXU acquisition involved five \ntimes more debt than equity, or roughly 83% of the acquisition price. By contrast, the Partners are using very low debt \nleverage to acquire ALLETE – approximately 8 percent of the Acquisition price – meaning the Acquisition has \nmaterially less risk compared to other utility acquisitions. As Witness Lapson explained, the TXU transaction was \n“the opposite of the proposed Acquisition.” Ex.

None of this is described in the Report. \n51 Attachment E at 52–54. \n52 Ex. MP-30 at 27 (Quackenbush Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-12 ).  \n53 Id. at 31. \n \n14 4. Omission of LIUNA Witness Testimony \nAs an additional, telling example of the Report’s lack of balance or meaningful analysis, the \nReport fails to even describe the testimony provided by some witnesses. Specifically, LIUNA \nWitness Bryant provided testimony about LIUNA’s involvement in pension funds and \ninfrastructure investment funds; its specific interactions with GIP; the low likelihood that ALLETE \ncan meet its capital needs through the public market; and the beneficial impact that private \nownership could have on ALLETE.54 The Report does not cite Witness Bryant one time even \nthough LIUNA’s testimony directly responds to and refutes several fundamental assertions of the \nOpposing Parties regarding alleged private equity tactics and the character of the Partners.55 This \nomission is particularly problematic because Witness Bryant is a non-petitioner witness with direct \nexperience with infrastructure funds and private equity, and with GIP specifically, which virtually \nevery other non-petitioner witness in the proceeding lacks. Ignoring her testimony entirely further \nexemplifies the failure of the Report to weigh the record as a whole. \n5. Dismissiveness of Partner Expertise  \nIn Finding 138, the Report asserts that the Partners’ expertise “is unlikely to provide a \nmaterial benefit to Minnesota Power or its ratepayers” because “ALLETE already has quality \nmanagement and ‘near perfect’ reliability for its electric service.”56 This finding also was copied \ndirectly from the Opposing Parties except for a formatting edit and the deletion  of language from \nOpposing Parties admitting that “the Partners’ expertise could benefit ratepayers to the extent that \n \n54 Ex. LIUNA-851 at 9 (Bryant Direct) (eDocket No. 20252-214955-01 ); Ex. LIUNA-852 at 11 (Bryant Rebuttal) \n(eDocket No. 20253-216057-01 ). \n55 See, e.g.,  Ex. LIUNA-851 at 9 (Bryant Direct) (eDocket No. 20252-214955-01 ) (“GIP is a proven and highly \nresponsible manager of infrastructure investments based on LIUNA’s extensive experience as a participant in GIP \nFunds and as a community stakeholder impacted by investments to which we are not a party. Our experience has given \nus confidence in the GIP’s capacity, and in the credibility of the commitments that are being made to regulators and \nstakeholders.”). \n56 Report at ¶ 138 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n \n15 it helps mitigate rate increases.”57 This finding not only fails to address Petitioners’ arguments and \npublic comments, but reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of the Partners’ \nexpertise demonstrated in the record.   \nThe point of the Partners’ expertise is not to replace that of Company management or to \nfill some perceived shortfall in management’s capabilities.58 As explained by Petitioners, “[t]he \nPartners’ expertise is beneficial even though the current ALLETE management team is also strong \nand experienced.”59 The record includes numerous examples of how the experience, expertise, and \nindustry relationships of the Partners can benefit the Company as it navigates the challenges of the \nenergy transition and compliance with the Carbon Free Standard. Through the Partners, the \nCompany and its management team will have access to best practices for capturing value and \nmitigating risk across the Company including, as needed, thoughts on capital expenditure \nmanagement, energy yield optimization, debt financing, tax equity, and procurement processes.60 \nWhile noticeably absent from the Report, the record shows the Partners have extensive experience \nsupporting companies developing renewable energy assets61 and pursuing innovative energy \ntransition-related investments and programs.62 The Acquisition also will afford the Company \n \n57 See Attachment E at 26. \n58 See, e.g. , Ex. MP-33 at 25–26 (Bram Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-08 ) (testifying that the Partners “have \nbeen very clear that part of the reason the Acquisition was attractive was the high quality of ALLETE’s management \nteam and employees as well as the Company’s track record of performance,” and explaining how the Partners’ \nexpertise “can augment the capabilities of the Company’s management team”). \n59 Joint Reply Brief at 41 (May 29, 2025) (eDocket No. 20255-219384-02 ). \n60 See, e.g. , Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Partner Initial Post-Hearing Brief at 38–46 (eDocket No. 20255-218522-\n01) (discussing the benefits of Partner expertise). \n61 Partner Initial Post-Hearing Brief at 40 (eDocket No. 20255-218522-01 ) (noting that GIP portfolio companies \noperate over 23 GW of renewable assets globally, including over 16 GW of operating wind and solar capacity, with \nan additional 178 GW under construction or in development); id. at 42–44 (describing CPP Investments’ interests in \ncompanies with 6 GW of high-quality wind, solar, transmission and energy storage projects installed in North America \nand an additional 29 GW of projects in development and active construction globally). \n62 Partner Initial Post-Hearing Brief at 41 (eDocket No. 20255-218522-01 ) (detailing GIP’s support for the world’s \nfirst 100 percent hydrogen-to-homes heating network and other innovative efforts); id. at 42 (explaining how CPP \nInvestments helped Puget Sound Energy to regularly meet its clean energy targets as part of satisfying Washington \nstate clean energy requirements). \n \n16 access to the Partners’ extensive relationships in industries necessary for the Company’s future \ngrowth and success, including equipment manufacturers and a broader set of lenders, which can \nmake a significant difference to the Company and its customers when markets become tight but \ncapital is needed.63 None of this information is described in the Report. \nTo be clear, there are numerous significant benefits to the Acquisition other than the \nPartners’ expertise. Nevertheless, this is a material benefit of the Acquisition and should be \nproperly considered. Despite the record evidence provided by the Partners, the Company,64 and \nthe public,65 the Report failed to do so. \nThe foregoing examples are just a few of the many instances where the Report ignores \nevidence and arguments from the Petitioners and intervenors supporting the Acquisition. On nearly \nevery issue, the Report fails entirely to acknowledge evidence and arguments from the Petitioners \nand parties who support the Acquisition. Even more critically, the Report fails throughout to weigh \ncompeting evidence or explain why one conclusion was reached instead of another.  \nThe Petitioners recognize that it is possible for people to review the same set of facts and \nreach different conclusions about what they mean. But that is not what happened with the Report. \nThe Report provides no indication that key facts were even reviewed let alone factored into \n \n63 Id. at 45 and nn. 176–78. \n64 See, e.g. , Joint Reply Brief at 40–41 (eDocket No. 20255-219384-02 ) (quoting Ex.

This is not just a business transaction. \nIt’s a pivotal opportunity to ensure that ALLETE has the tools, the capital, and the strategic expertise to deliver on the \npromise of clean, affordable, and reliable energy, and everybody tonight has spoken in favor of that now and for \ndecades to come.”) (Matt Baumgartner, Pres. Duluth Area Chamber of Commerce); id. at 74:22–75:11 (“Why are \nthese the right partners? The CPP and the GIP are not short-term investors. I’ve looked at their financial records.

Either way, the full record is not described \nfor the Commission, and that is a clear indication that the Report is insufficient and should be \nrejected. Making a decision based on only part of the record, without acknowledging or weighing \nthe full record, represents the application of a decision-maker’s will, rather than judgment, and \nclearly reflects arbitrary decision-making.67 \nD. The Report is Dismissive of Public Comments Supporting the Acquisition. \nThe Report is also one-sided with respect to its treatment of public commenters. Individual \nmembers of the public were given an opportunity to provide their comments at several public \nhearings. Remote public hearings were held on January 10 and April 10, 2025. From April 7 to \nApril 11, 2025, in-person public hearings were held in Cloquet, Duluth, Eveleth, and Cohasset. In \naddition to comments provided during the public hearings, the record contains numerous written \npublic comments filed by members of the public. \n \n66 See In re Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership , 930 N.W.2d 12, 35 (Minn. Ct. App. 2019) (citing Reserve Mining \nCo. v. Herbst , 256 N.W.2d 808, 825 (Minn. 1977)). \n67 See Matter of Denial of Contested Case Hearing Request , 993 N.W.2d at 646 (“An agency decision is arbitrary or \ncapricious if it ‘represents the agency’s will and not its judgment.’ In applying the arbitrary or capricious standard, we \nconsider whether ‘a combination of danger signals’ suggests that ‘the agency has not taken a ‘hard look’ at the salient \nproblems and ‘has not genuinely engaged in reasoned decision-making.’”) (citations omitted). \n \n18 The Report suggests that the only comments that matter are those in opposition to the \nAcquisition. In contrast, comments that were provided in support of the Acquisition are dismissed \nout-of-hand. Specifically, the Report speculates that “[i]t is unclear whether these individuals felt \nobligated to support Minnesota Power due to the financial support they are provided by the \ncompany.”68 This speculation dismisses the opinion of dozens of commenters without any basis \nfor doing so. It is a significant act for members of the public to provide public comments in a \npublic hearing, in front of a judge, and with a court reporter. It is inappropriate and insulting to \nsuggest commenters in support of the Acquisition are driven by a financial interest, particularly \nwithout identifying any factual basis for such a suggestion. The Report’s cavalier dismissal of the \ncomments in support of the Acquisition is a sign of deep disrespect for the people in northern \nMinnesota who chose to make their opinions known. It is also a sign of troubling bias against the \nAcquisition and those supporting it.69 \nThe Report also discounts comments in support of the Acquisition on the grounds that they \n“largely repeated” the Petitioners’ arguments.70 That is a poor reason to discount the value of \npublic comments generally, but it is particularly inequitable and egregious to dismiss public \n \n68 Report, Addendum A at ¶ 4 (eDocket No. 20257-221125-01 ). \n69 Virtual Pub.

The Report finds fault only with those comments in support of the Acquisition – a \nclear sign of disparate treatment. This disparate treatment is another reason that the Report should \nnot be relied upon to decide this case.  \nFinally, the Petitioners take exception to the treatment of public commenters in the Report \nand the insinuation, noted above, that supporters of the Acquisition lack integrity and would make \nfalse statements for alleged financial gain.

Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with their viewpoints, public \ncommenters should be treated with equal respect. \nE. The Management of the Evidentiary Hearing Further Demonstrates that the \nReport is Not Reliable.  \nOther events from the proceeding also raise concerns about the reliability of the Report. \nFirst, the Petitioners were denied an opportunity to correct documents in which errors were \ndiscovered during the evidentiary hearing, while other parties were permitted to do so. During the \nevidentiary hearing, it became apparent that a document in the record included a drafting error \nabout how budgets will be approved in the future. The Partners had already provided testimony \nabout the plan for approving budgets and other corporate governance issues,74 and in surrebuttal \nhad provided an updated document explaining those plans.75 During cross-examination of \nCompany Witness Scissons (who did not even sponsor the exhibit), it became apparent that a few \nwords in the document were leftovers from a prior version and not consistent with the intent of the \nPartners or the Partner and Company testimony that had previously been filed ; in other words, \nthere was a drafting error. \nThe Partners prepared an updated document that night correcting a few words in one \nsentence in the document at issue.76 But the ALJ did not permit the Partners to introduce a corrected \nversion of the document.77 In contrast, later in the hearing the ALJ permitted several Opposing \nParties to correct substantive errors on the record and introduce documents late in the hearing when \n \n74 Ex. MP-31 at 39 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-09 ) (“ALLETE’s management team will develop \nand propose the budget in the first instance.”); Ex. MP-33 at 43 (Bram Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-08 ) \n(“[T]he Company’s management team will continue to be the central piece of the strategic planning process, . . . [and \nis] responsible for developing strategic plans, including budgets . . . and bringing them to the ALLETE board.”). \n75 Ex. MP-42, Schedule 1 at 5 (Bram Surrebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216814-02) (HCTS). \n76 Evid. Hr. Tr. at 367 (Apr. 2, 2025). \n77 See id.  at 367, 369–70, 372. \n \n21 those omissions were identified during the hearing.78 Further, the Report actually criticizes the \nPetitioners for trying to ensure that the record was fully developed on this issue.79 This disparate \ntreatment was a consistent theme during the contested case.  \nSecond, despite the concerns expressed in the Report about the Partners, the ALJ did not \ntest those concerns by asking questions of the Partners during the evidentiary hearing. Doing so \nwould have clarified on the record whether there was a legitimate basis for those concerns. CPP \nInvestments Witness Andrew Alley and GIP Witness Jonathan Bram were present during the \nevidentiary hearing and fully prepared to answer any questions about the Partners that were put to \nthem. At the last moment, the Opposing Parties made a tactical litigation decision to not ask any \nquestions of Witness Alley or Witness Bram.80 The ALJ also chose not to ask questions of Witness \nAlley or Witness Bram.81 \nGiven the negative findings and outright accusations in the Report, including the claim that \nPartners’ public statements are inconsistent with their internal documents, the Partners’ appearance \nat the hearing was an opportunity for parties and the ALJ to directly explore the Partners’ plans \nand intentions, under oath. Despite parties’ many assumptions and assertions regarding the \nPartners’ intentions and plans (which were adopted without critical analysis in the Report), no \nquestioner, including the ALJ, actually tested any of their assumptions or assertions during the \nevidentiary hearing. The decision not to ask questions of the Partners’ witnesses (but subsequently \ndisparage those witnesses) does not appear consistent with the responsibility of an ALJ under the \n \n78 See Evid. Hr. Tr. at 733–53, 809, 829–30 (Apr. 3, 2025). \n79 Report Memorandum at 73, n. 605 (eDocket No. 20257-221061-02) (HCTS). \n80 See Evid. Hr. Tr. at 452:6–10 (Apr. 2, 2025). \n81 The Report’s lack of care in summarizing the complete record is consistent with carelessness in other aspects of the \ncontested case proceeding. For example, the Petitioners’ Highly Confidential Trade Secret Information was released \nto the public when the ALJ’s office filed the Highly Confidential Trade Secret version of the Report as a public \ndocument on July 16, 2025. It was available on the public internet for more than two hours, in violation of the \nProtective Order for Highly Confidential Trade Secret Information issued in this matter. \n \n22 Court of Administrative Hearings Rules to “examine witnesses as necessary to make a complete \nrecord,” particularly after all other parties waived their chance to do so.82 \nF. The Report Misstates the Standard of Review. \nThe Commission should also disregard the Report because it gets the law wrong. Pursuant \nto Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, the Commission “shall” approve a transaction if it is “consistent with \nthe public interest.” For years, the Commission has consistently interpreted this statute as requiring \npetitioners to prove that the proposed action causes no net harm to the public interest. The Report, \nhowever, departs from this well-established standard and suggests a re-interpretation of the law to \ncreate a higher standard, requiring Petitioners to demonstrate affirmative benefits from a proposed \ntransaction. This newly invented standard is inconsistent with the Commission’s precedents and \nwith the law. \nThe Commission most clearly stated the standard of review under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 \nwhen approving the merger that formed Xcel Energy: \nIf the perceived detriments do not outweigh the perceived benefits, the merger is \ndeemed to be ‘consistent with the public interest.’ [Minn. Stat. § 216B.50] thus \ndoes not require that proposed mergers affirmatively benefit ratepayers or the \npublic or that they otherwise promote the public interest. They cannot contravene \nthe public interest, however, and must be shown to be compatible with it.83 \n \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Commission specifically rejected a request to establish a higher \n“net benefits” standard. \n The Report suggests that the standard the Commission applied in the Xcel Energy case \nshould not be followed because the standard of review was not disputed in that case.84 But that is \n \n82 Minn. R. 1400.5500(H). \n83 In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Company for Approval to Merge with New Century \nEnergies, Inc. , Docket No. E,G002/PA-99-1031, O RDER APPROVING MERGER , as Conditioned at 7 (June 12, 2000) \n(eDocket No. 789046 ). \n84 Report Memorandum at 69–71 (eDocket No. 20257-221061-02 (HCTS)). \n \n23 not true. In that case, the ALJ issued a report recommending approval of a settlement and approval \nof the transaction with conditions. Following the ALJ’s recommendation, a party specifically \nargued that the ALJ had applied the wrong standard and requested that the Commission re-open \nthe proceedings and require Northern States Power Company d/b/a Xcel Energy to show that it \nmet the net benefits rather than the “no net harm” standard.85 The Commission specifically \naddressed this argument and stated that the “ALJ applied the correct standard,” and then provided \nthe language above. While the ALJ in that proceeding did identify benefits from the proposed \nmerger, the Commission specifically stated that it was not a requirement “that proposed mergers \naffirmatively benefit ratepayers or the public or that they otherwise promote the public interest.”86 \nThe Commission has continuously applied the same statutory standard in the decades since \nthe Xcel Energy merger proceeding.87 Despite this clear standard, the Report suggests that the \n \n85 In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Company for Approval to Merge with New Century \nEnergies, Inc. , Docket No. E,G002/PA-99-1031, O RDER APPROVING MERGER , AS CONDITIONED  at 7 (June 12, 2000) \n(eDocket No. 789046 ). \n86 Id. \n87 In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Merger Agreement Between Integrys Energy Group, Inc. and \nWisconsin Energy Corporation , Docket No. G011/PA-14-664, O RDER APPROVING MERGER SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS  \nat 2–3 (June 25, 2015) (eDocket No. 20156-111752-01 ); In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Acquisition \nby MDU Resources Group, Inc., and its Division, Great Plains Natural Gas Company, of Cascade Natural Gas \nCorporation , Docket No. G004/PA-06-1585, O RDER APPROVING ACQUISITION , with Conditions at 2 (Mar. 23, 2007) \n(eDocket No. 3943867 ) (“The Commission previously has established that the public interest standard does not require \nan affirmative finding of public benefit – just a finding that the transaction does not contravene the public interest, and \nis compatible with the public interest.”);  In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Company for \nApproval to Merge with New Century Energies, Inc. , Docket No. E,G002/PA-99-1031, O RDER APPROVING MERGER , \nas Conditioned at 11  (June 12, 2000) (eDocket No.  789046 ); In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Acquisition \nof the Stock of Natrogas, Incorporated (Natrogas), a Merger of Northern States Power Company (NSP) and Western \nGas Utilities, Inc.

In reaching this conclusion, the Report selectively relied88 on \nlegislative findings to underscore customer interests, such as reliability and reasonable rates, while \nclearly neglecting the Legislature’s plain language directive that the Commission should also \nconsider “the financial and economic requirements of public utilities.”89 Such selective emphasis \nmisrepresents legislative intent, as the statute requires balancing both consumer protections and \nutility financial health.90 \nFurther, the Report ignores the analysis Petitioners provided regarding when a net benefits \ntest is applied in some other states. In particular, Petitioners noted that the other states that apply \nthe net benefits standard have different language in their statutes specifically requiring the \napplication of that standard. For example, the Washington Utilities and Transportation \nCommission previously applied the same no net harm standard as Minnesota, but now applies the \nnet benefits standard because the Washington State Legislature amended the law to specifically \nrequire the higher standard.91 In other words, other states that use the net benefit standard do so \nbecause they have statutes explicitly calling for the application of that standard. Minn. Stat. § \n216B.50 does not include that language, and the Commission has determined that Minnesota \napplies the no net harm standard.  \n \n88 The Report erroneously relied entirely on positions taken by the Opposing Parties. \n89 Minn. Stat. § 216B.01. \n90 In evaluating a utility’s decisions about core business decisions about whether it needs to be acquired to ensure it \ncan finance projects its customers need, it is appropriate to give substantial weight to a utility’s economic \ndeterminations. See Nw. Bell v. State , 216 N.W. 2d 841, 851 (Minn. 1974) (holding that there are limits to the extent \nthat utility regulators should second-guess the economic and business judgment of utility management: “Unless there \nis evidence that such expansion has outstripped all likelihood of reasonably imminent use, . . . the commission and the \ncourts are not in a position to second-guess the engineering and economic expertise of company management. ”) \n(emphasis added). \n91 Ex. MP-59 at 11–23 (Hydro One Ltd and Avista Corp. Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission Docket \nNo. U-170970 – 12/5/2018 Order 07) (eDocket No. 20254-217287-13 ); LPI Initial Brief at 11–13 (eDocket No. 20255-\n218497-02 ). \n \n25 It is not appropriate for the ALJ to substitute her judgment for that of the Commission, \nwhich adhered to the express “consistent with the public interest” language of the statute years ago \nand has consistently applied it since. There is no reasonable basis to change this longstanding \ninterpretation of the statutory language.92 \nIII. The Concerns Raised in the Report are Speculative and Any Concerns are \nAddressed by the Commitments in the Settlement. \nThe Report focuses on a series of speculative concerns that are: (1) not supported by the \nrecord; and (2) addressed by the Settlement. An accurate evaluation of the entire record \ndemonstrates that these fears are unfounded. \nGiven the volume of the record in this proceeding, these Exceptions provide a high-level \nexplanation of why the Report is incorrect. While it is not practicable to specifically describe each \nand every piece of evidence and argument that was not evaluated in the Report, Petitioners provide \nhere a summary of the evidence and arguments on key issues. Attachment A provides a table \nidentifying issues raised by the Report and referencing the location of Petitioners’ responses in the \ntestimony and briefing. The Initial and Reply Briefs filed by the Petitioners also provide a more \nthorough evaluation of the record and why it demonstrates that the Acquisition is consistent with \nthe public interest. \nA. Stereotypes about “Private Equity” Investors \nThe Report accepts a multitude of claims about the Partners that are based on the erroneous \nassumption that the Partners fit the generalized description of all “private equity” investors \n \n92 In re Detailing Criteria and Standards for Measuring Electric Utility’s Good Faith Efforts in Meeting the Renewable \nEnergy Objectives Under Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691 , 700 N.W.2d 533, 539 (Minn. Ct. App. 2005) (“[A]lthough an \nagency is not bound to follow its past decisions, it must provide a reasonable basis for departure from precedent.”). \n \n26 described by Opposing Parties.93 That characterization of the Partners is a hasty overgeneralization \nthat is not accurate and is not supported by the record.  \nThe Report fails to fully and accurately reflect who the Partners actually are – their \nstructure, track record, reputation, and analysis of the Acquisition. For example, the Report \ninaccurately describes the Partners as private equity investors, apparently in an attempt to suggest \nthat they will behave like stereotypical private equity investors portrayed in media. But the Partners \nare mostly made up of pension funds. CPP Investments is fundamentally a pension fund, managing \nthe funds of the Canada Pension Plan. And CalPERS, which represents 20 percent of the \ninvestment into the Company, is also a pension fund. Sixty percent of ALLETE will be owned by \npension funds making investments on behalf of public employees in California and Canadian \nworkers and beneficiaries, which are categorically not private equity investors.94 GIP is also not a \ntypical private equity investor, but a private infrastructure investment firm that focuses on longer-\nterm infrastructure investments and not the high-yield, high-risk types of investments targeted by \nsome private equity investors. \nRather than discuss the Partners themselves, the Report and Opposing Parties focus on a \ngeneral caricature of what they believe “private equity” investors do or how they behave. The \nReport’s broad and simplistic characterization of private equity not only has no credible \nevidentiary basis, but more importantly, it fails to accurately reflect the actual buyers in this case \nas described in the record. Neither the Opposing Parties nor the Report identify any examples of \n \n93 See Report at Sections II.D and IV (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ); Report Memorandum at 72 (eDocket No. \n20257-221061-02) (HCTS). \n94 Ex. MP-13 at 7 (Alley Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-10 ); Ex. LIUNA-852 at 11 (Bryant Rebuttal) (eDocket \nNo. 20253-216057-01 ); Evid. Hr. Tr. at 578:13–15 (Apr. 2, 2025). \n \n27 either Partner actually doing the things they allege the Partners will do.95 The Report and Opposing \nParty claims are based on speculation, not facts. The only first-hand representation of the character \nof the Partners is from LIUNA Witness Bryant, who testified: \nGIP is a proven and highly responsible manager of infrastructure investments based \non LIUNA’s extensive experience as a participant in GIP funds and as a community \nstakeholder impacted by investments to which we are not a party. Our experience \nhas given us confidence in the GIP’s capacity, and in the credibility of the \ncommitments that are being made to regulators and stakeholders.96 \n \nThe Report fails to include this evidence.97  \nThe Report’s mischaracterization of who the Partners actually are is evident in Findings 73 \nand 74, which selectively describes only GIP’s investments in natural gas and oil companies. \nNotably absent from the Report is any reference to the evidence showing that GIP has over $15 \nbillion invested in or committed to renewable energy development, including 23 GW of existing \nrenewable assets and an additional 178 GW under construction. These facts were raised in multiple \n \n95 [HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS …   \n  \n  … HCTS \nINFORMATION ENDS]  Ex. DOC-303, CMA-D-12 at 75 (Addonizio Direct) (eDocket No. 20252-214942-01) \n(HCTS). The Report simply adopted without inquiry the misleading story about SunPower and GIP’s investment in \nthat entity. See Report at ¶ 227 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). Once again, a full review of the record supports a \ndifferent conclusion. Public records demonstrate that GIP’s ownership interest in SunPower was far less than portrayed \nby the Opposing Parties, began only after  the company was in significant distress and the financial reporting issues \nhad occurred, and that GIP attempted to save the company, investing heavily, but by that time it was too late and the \nprior issues could not be rectified. See Partner Initial Post-Hearing Brief at 57, n. 220 (eDocket No. 20255-218522-\n01). \n96 Ex. LIUNA-851 at 9 (Bryant Direct) (eDocket No. 20252-214955-01 ). \n97 The only other “examples” of issues with the Partners’ prior investments are reports related to companies in which \nthe Partners had only minority investments, as shown in the record, and in one of those examples the Partner used \nwhat minimal authority it did have to rectify financial reporting issues then provided additional capital in attempt to \nsave the company.

In another, the \nconclusion that a Partner is not engaged in labor matters because it did not make a public statement about an indirect \ninvestment it made through an investment manager is baseless. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT\nTRADE SECRET DATA EXCISED\n \n28 pieces of testimony,98 and in both initial and reply briefs,99 but they are nowhere to be found in the \nReport. \nIn addition, while the Report refers repeatedly to the risks of private investors owning a \npublic utility, again largely copying the proposed findings of the Opposing Parties, the Report \nomits any reference to the substantial positive metrics associated with private ownership of \nregulated utilities. This includes: (a) CPP Investments’ financial interest in Puget Sound Energy \nfor over 10 years during which the utility’s rates increased at a rate below inflation with no \nevidence of any harm to the public interest; (b) the evidence provided, in response to a question \nfrom Staff, that the Partners’ other investments in regulated utilities are managed to have \nreasonable levels of debt and equity;100 and (c) the evidence introduced by Petitioners \ndemonstrating that, following other utility take-private transactions, the compound average growth \nrate of those utilities’ rates was just 1.62 percent per year. This evidence shows that utility rate \nfilings following take-private transactions have not only been well below inflation but also lower \nthan their respective statewide averages and national investor-owned utility averages over the same \ntime period.101 The Report `fails to include or discuss any of this evidence.102  \nFinally, the Report fails to acknowledge that the Partners have made extensive \ncommitments to address the private equity-related concerns raised by Opposing Parties and relied \nupon in the Report.

Such acquisition would not have required any \nCommission oversight or approval. Further, such calculated acquisition would have allowed an \nentity, or a group of entities including private equity or even energy companies with interests \nadverse to Minnesota Power’s climate awareness goals, to take control of the ALLETE Board of \nDirectors. In such an instance, there would be no commitments of the types made by Minnesota \n \n103 Ex. CURE-600 at 4 (Baker Direct) (eDocket No. 20252-214963-04 ) (“[T]his debt is almost always non-recourse \nto the private equity or private infrastructure manager; that is to say, the portfolio company is ultimately responsible \nfor paying back the debt, not the private equity firm.”). \n104 Ex.

These are precisely the reasons the \nCompany went through the careful and detailed process outlined in the Proxy Statement. \nB. Transparency of the Partners \nThe Report endorses Opposing Parties’ baseless claims that the Partners have not been \ntransparent through the course of the proceeding. This is a disingenuous argument by Opposing \nParties who have used it extensively in public comments despite the fact the Opposing Parties have \naccess to all confidential information at issue. It certainly should not have been adopted in the \nReport. \nAt the heart of this purported “lack of transparency” is the need to protect trade secret \ninformation, a commercially important ability in legal proceedings recognized not only by \nMinnesota statute108 and the Commission,109 but also by the Opposing Parties who stipulated to \nprotections and the ALJ who issued protective orders. The other allegedly non-transparent actions \nby Petitioners were the assertion of legal privileges and other defenses in the discovery process.110 \nThe Petitioners’ assertions of these protections and privileges do not demonstrate lack of \ntransparency. They are the normal and expected result of the hearing process established by the \n \n108 Minn. Stat. § 13.37. \n109 For example, during January 2025, the Commission received 96 filings in the eDockets system marked as protected. \nA search was conducted on www.edockest.state.mn.us on the date range 1/1/25 to 1/31/25, and the results were sorted \nby “Class” to determine which were marked as trade secret. \n110 Report at ¶¶ 248–49 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n \n31 Commission, and indeed are important rights for parties to retain,111 again as initially recognized \nby the ALJ in protective and prehearing orders during the proceeding.112 \nC. Consistency with Partner Documents \nThe Report also suggests that the Partners’ public statements are not consistent with their \ninternal documents.113 While the Report does not identify specific statements it is concerned about, \nit appears to focus on concerns related to the Partners’ internal financial analyses.114 A careful \nreview of those analyses, however, demonstrates that the contents of these documents is fully \nconsistent with the public interest and not a cause for concern for several reasons. \nFirst, it is entirely consistent with the public interest that the Partners hope to earn a return \non their investment in Minnesota Power, just like Minnesota Power’s existing investors, and all \ninvestors. It is also entirely consistent with the public interest that the Partners, as the owners of \nALLETE, intend to have a role in making high-level decisions such as approving budgets. This is, \nagain, consistent with the role of ALLETE’s current board and the structure of many companies. \n \n111 In fact, if a party believes something to be privileged, for example, and they fail to object to provide it in discovery, \nthey will have waived their privilege not only in that proceeding but in all other proceedings. It would be irresponsible \nnot to try to protect such information. E.g., Kobluk v. Univ. of Minnesota , 574 N.W.2d 436, 444 (Minn. 1998) (stating \npresumption of confidentiality for attorney-client privilege evaporates if “the client does not appear to have been \ndesirous of secrecy”). \n112 Protective Order for Trade Secret Data (Dec. 5, 2024) (eDocket No. 202412-212750-01 ); Protective Order for \nHighly Confidential Trade Secret Data (Dec. 16, 2024) (eDocket No. 202412-212992-01 ). If the ALJ had questions \nabout the HCTS or other protective designations that were retained for this proceeding, the ALJ or the Opposing \nParties had the opportunity to question the Partners but elected not to question them on any issues during the \nevidentiary hearing. \n113 Report Memorandum at 72 (eDocket No. 20257-221061-02 (HCTS)). \n114 The Opposing Parties misunderstand and therefore incorrectly characterize the purpose of certain internal \ndocuments used by the Partners, which undermines the validity of the assumptions and conclusions in the Opposing \nParties’ proposed findings. Specifically, as described herein, documents like investment committee memoranda \nevaluate potential scenarios and, in order to do so, must rely on certain assumptions that are described in the \nmemoranda. These scenarios help decision-makers understand the risks of moving forward with an investment, but \nthey are not statements of intention or definitive plans to be implemented in the future. See Partner Initial Post-Hearing \nBrief at 58–61 (eDocket No. 20255-218522-01 ) (explaining the purpose, content, and use of investment committee \nmemoranda). Unfortunately, the Report adopts and repeats the Opposing Parties’ errors and assumptions without \nexamination or analysis, replicating the same flawed conclusions. \n \n32 Second, to the extent the Report is referring to concerns about “operational engineering,” \nthere is no support for such concerns in the record. Department Witness Addonizio testified that \nhe “do[es]n’t have major concerns about that particular tactic,”115 and OAG Witness Lebens \nspecifically invited the Partners to explore actions that could improve ALLETE’s efficiency for \nthe benefit of customers.116 \nThird, to the extent the Report is referring to concerns that internal Partner documents \nsuggest that the Partners will engage in “financial engineering,” that conclusion is not supported \nby the record. A careful review of the internal Partner documents and analyses demonstrate that \nthey represent the type of financial analysis that any reasonable investor would perform before \nmaking a $3.9 billion investment, and that the assumptions used to perform the evaluations are \nreasonable. They confirm, rather than contradict, the Partners’ representations and commitments. \nFor example, the Partners’ internal documents and analyses include the following \ninformation: \n ROE: Partner investment models included the assumption that Minnesota Power’s \nregulated ROE [HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS …   \n \n  \n … HCTS \nINFORMATION ENDS]  This simplifying assumption clarifies that the Partners’ \ninvestment decision is not premised on any particular ROE for Minnesota Power, much \n \n115 Evid.

The Report does not reference \nany of this information. \n “Financial Engineering” and use of debt financing. The Report claims that the Partners will \nrely on reckless “financial engineering” and increase debt leverage in a way that harms \ncustomers.119 That is not the case.120 The Partners’ internal investment models included an \nassumption that ALLETE will be financed using some debt – like every business121 – and \nthat the level of debt used will be maintained at a fixed ratio as the Company grows.122 As \nthe Company grows over time, the level of debt is assumed to increase as it would for all \nbusinesses investing capital, but is maintained at a consistent ratio – and the ratio is \ndesigned to target investment-grade credit metrics.123 The Report does not describe this \ninformation. \n Expected Investment Period: The Report repeatedly suggests that the Partners do not have \na long-term focus,124 citing the Partners’ internal communications. But the Partners’ public \nstatements that they focus on a long-run investment timeline is consistent with the analysis \nin their internal documents. For example, [HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n \n119 See Report at Section IV.B.1 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n120 The only record evidence related to “financial engineering” specific to the Partners is a disclaimer  of financial \nengineering as a tool in infrastructure investing.

They do not suggest, in any way, that the Partners’ internal \ndocuments are inconsistent with either their public statements or the public interest. \nD. Enforceability of Capital Commitment \nThe Report also includes a wholly inaccurate claim that the Petitioners’ private agreements \nor discussions conflict with their public statements.128 While it is not clear what private agreements \nor discussions the Report is referring to, the Report seems to assert that the Partners in their private \nagreements “have not, in fact, promised to provide capital to ALLETE.”129 \nThis is demonstrably false. In fact, the Partners have expressly committed to providing \nequity capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year investment plan, as reflected in the 2024 10-K.130 This \ncommitment was entered into the record through the sworn testimony of Witness Alley and \n \n125 Ex.

Enforceability has been further enhanced through \nadditional language agreed to in the Settlement, where the Petitioners have committed that no \ndividends will be paid by the Company if the capital commitment is not met. \nThe Report seems troubled that this commitment was not in the initial merger agreement, \nbut there is no basis for that concern. A capital commitment was not needed at the time of the \nmerger agreement because ALLETE was confident that the Partners would follow through and \nprovide capital as needed. That fact is discussed at length in the record132 but overlooked entirely \nby the Report. Simply put, the Partners’ and Company’s interests are aligned, and the Partners \nhave every incentive to support ALLETE by providing capital and otherwise acting in the long-\nterm best interests of the Company. While the Petitioners do not agree with the concerns of the \nOpposing Parties, the Partners developed the capital commitment in response to and in order to \naddress those concerns by assuring that Minnesota Power would have the equity needed to finance \ninvestments.  \nThere is no gap between the Partners’ public commitment to provide equity and what they \nhave agreed to do. In fact, the Partners have committed to very significant and enforceable \nobligations to ensure that ALLETE is provided with the equity capital needed to support its five-\nyear investment plan, which these investors are highly motivated to do since funding that plan is \ncore to their reason for investing $3.9 billion into ALLETE in the first place. \n \n131 Ex. MP-31 at 6–7 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-09 ); Ex. MP-33 at 51, 55 (Bram Rebuttal) (eDocket \nNo. 20253-216055-08 ). \n132 See, e.g. , Joint Reply Brief at 16, 36, 54 (eDocket No. 20255-219384-02 ) (discussing alignment of interests between \nthe Partners and the Company and the incentives of Partners to ensure the long-term financial health and success of \nthe Company). \n \n36 E. Speculation About Rate Increases \n The Report suggests that the Acquisition could result in increased rates,133 but there is no \nevidence in the record to support this conclusion, only speculation. Petitioners have provided \nspecific commitments that the costs of the Acquisition itself will never be included in rates.134 It \nis also clear that the Commission will determine what significant investments Minnesota Power \nwill make to meet the Carbon Free Standard, exercising substantial control over any rate impacts \nin the future. \n Further, to the extent the Acquisition will have any impact on rates, it will result in lower \nrates. As described above, the Petitioners have committed to a wide range of rate reductions, non-\nrecoverable investments, and a rate case stay-out that will mitigate rate impacts for customers. \nThrough a combination of one-time cost savings and cost reductions over time, these financial \nbenefits are estimated to save customers approximately $132 million.135 Absent the Acquisition, \ncustomers will not receive these rate benefits. \nAny changes to rates in the future will be driven by changes in the cost of providing service. \nThere is no evidence in the record suggesting that the Acquisition will increase the cost of service, \nand in fact Petitioners have committed to several conditions that will reduce the cost of service. \nTo the extent that there is an increase in the investments needed in the future, those also are driven \nby the need to serve customers and are not caused by the Acquisition. The investment plan is \ndriven by the Company’s best assessment of what is needed to ensure reliable service to customers, \nand to comply with the Carbon Free Standard. Importantly, those investments will be needed with \nor without the Partners, and the Report’s assumption that they are somehow caused by the \n \n133 See Report at Section IV.C.1 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n134 Settlement at 1.40 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n135 Attachment C. \n \n37 Acquisition is incorrect. The future rate estimates reflected in the Partners’ internal documents are \nthe result of a financial analysis of Minnesota Power’s existing capital plan, not reflective of a \nstrategy to increase rates. That capital plan is rooted in compliance with the Carbon Free Standard \nand completion of other needed upgrades to Minnesota Power’s infrastructure. Moreover, the \nReport’s conclusion fails to recognize that all future rates will be approved by the Commission. \nRate increases cannot happen unless they are approved by the Commission, and the Commission \nwill continue to ensure that Minnesota Power’s rates are just and reasonable.  \nF. Carbon Free Standard \nThe Report contains a number of findings related to the Carbon Free Standard that are not \naccurate. \nFirst, the Report does not accurately summarize the evidence in the record demonstrating \nthe Partners’ interest in and commitment to the energy transition. The Partners have publicly \ntestified that they are primarily interested in ALLETE and Minnesota Power because of the \nopportunity to invest in the energy transition.136 In addition, the Partners’ internal documents \ndemonstrate that the Partners each view ALLETE’s current exposure to coal as a risk that reduces \nthe Company’s value. In fact, the Partners’ internal documents indicate that the Partners would \nview accelerating compliance with the Carbon Free Standard as a benefit, consistent with \nCommission approval.137 \nSecond, the Report includes a concerning discussion suggesting that it would be acceptable \nto delay or modify compliance with the Carbon Free Standard in order to justify rejecting the \n \n136 Ex. MP-13 at 12–13 (Alley Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-10 ); Ex. MP-14 at 4–5 (Bram Direct) (eDocket \nNo. 202412-212968-09 ). \n137 Ex.

The \nCarbon Free Standard is a critical Minnesota policy requirement, and Minnesota Power is \ncommitted to compliance.139 Petitioners strongly disagree with the Report’s suggestion that \ndelaying compliance with the Carbon Free Standard is an acceptable outcome, and that delaying \ncompliance is an acceptable consequence of rejecting the Acquisition.  \nWith the Acquisition, Petitioners are confident that the Company will be able to finance \nthe investments needed to work towards compliance. Without the Acquisition, Minnesota Power \nwould have severe challenges complying with the Carbon Free Standard;140 and even if financing \nwere available, it would very likely result in higher costs and additional upward pressure on \ncustomer rates that could be avoided through the Acquisition. It is critical that these risks be \nincorporated into any analysis about the public interest, because one of the key benefits of the \nAcquisition is that it avoids these risks related to complying with the Carbon Free Standard. \nG. Minnesota Power’s Financial Health \nThe Report reflects numerous fears of adverse impacts on ALLETE’s financial health as a \nresult of the Acquisition.141 The Petitioners explained in their testimony and briefs why these fears \nare unfounded.142 Further, the commitments made during the contested case, and the additional \nsignificant commitments included in the Settlement, mitigate any fears described in the Report. \nSpecifically, the Settlement includes commitments related to: \n \n138 Report Memorandum at 72 (eDocket No. 20257-221061-02) (HCTS). \n139 Evid.

It is unnecessary and inappropriate \nto take such steps. Opposing parties, and therefore the Report, point to decisions in different \njurisdictions – El Paso and South Jersey  – to support such an extreme request.

Thus, the Partners have every incentive to support the \nlong-term financial health of the Company and the capital plan needed to comply with the Carbon \nFree Standard.149  \nNotwithstanding the above, the comprehensive terms negotiated in the Settlement \nAgreement with the Department include provisions that materially modify the governance of \nALLETE in a manner that addresses stated governance concerns, and remains consistent with the \npublic interest. Specifically, Paragraph 1.23 of the Settlement confirms that the Company’s senior \nmanagement team will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of Minnesota Power, increases \nthe number of independent directors on the ALLETE Board of Directors, and provides additional \ngovernance commitments supported by the Department. \nH. Service Quality \n The Report identifies concerns that the Acquisition will result in reduced service quality.150 \nThe primary argument in the Report appears to be that Minnesota Power may not have sufficient \nfunding to maintain service quality. The commitments that protect the financial health of the utility \nare described above. In addition, the Settlement provides a very significant new commitment to \nestablish service quality performance metrics, reporting, and financial penalties if the metrics are \nnot achieved.151 The Commission does not have express authority from the Legislature to assess \nfinancial penalties for service quality, so this commitment – attainable only through approval of \n \nacquisition of two gas distribution utilities, capital expenditures were not even mentioned in the order approving the \nacquisition. In the Matter of the Merger of South Jersey Industries, Inc. and Boardwalk Merger Sub, Inc. , New Jersey \nBoard of Public Utilities Docket No. GM22040270, O RDER ON STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT  (Jan. 25, 2023).  \n149 Ex.

(eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n151 Settlement at 1.64 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n \n41 the Settlement and the Acquisition – will substantially increase the Commission’s visibility into \nMinnesota Power’s service quality and its authority to ensure that service quality is maintained. \nI. Insufficient Investment by Minnesota Power \nThe Report also claims that the Acquisition will result in Minnesota Power not having \nenough capital to make the investments it needs.152 At the outset, this line of argument is unfounded \nbecause Minnesota Power pursued the Acquisition specifically to improve its ability to finance \nutility projects, and the Partners pursued the Acquisition to deploy capital through a well-managed \ncompany. Further, the Partners have agreed to a binding commitment to provide all of the equity \ncapital needed for the five-year capital plan. As explained on the record, the Partners intend to \nprovide all of the equity capital Minnesota Power needs as long as they own the Company and \nhave powerful economic incentives to do so. To further demonstrate that commitment, the Partners \nhave provided a binding five-year commitment in response to specific concerns identified by \nOpposing Parties. \nThe Report suggests that the capital commitment has little value, but that is wrong for \nseveral reasons. First, the capital commitment is enforceable both because the Commission has \nenforcement authority against any “person,” which includes corporate entities,153 such as Alloy \nParent, and the settlement contains new enforcement provisions. Second, Settlement paragraphs \n1.4 and 1.5 provide that ALLETE will not make any dividend payments unless the capital \ncommitment is met, and establish a reporting system to ensure compliance with the capital \ncommitment and the dividend limitation. Because dividends are the way that the Partners can \nreceive cash from ALLETE, this commitment means that the Partners cannot receive cash from \ntheir investment if they do not make good on this commitment.  \n \n152 Report at ¶¶ 181-85 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n153 Minn. Stat. § 216B.54. \n \n42 Third, it makes little sense for the Partners to invest billions of dollars to acquire ALLETE \nand then refuse to fund it with needed capital. The Partners have strong economic incentives to \nensure that ALLETE has sufficient equity capital because they need to protect the value of their \ninvestment. Further, the value of the Partners’ investment in ALLETE cannot be increased if the \nCompany is not able to make needed investments. If ALLETE does not have enough capital to \nfinance its projects, its value will be reduced, which would objectively harm the Partners. While it \nis academically interesting to consider whether an investor would choose to withhold capital from \na company it invests in, in the real world the Partners must ensure that Minnesota Power has the \nfinancing it requires in order to protect the value of their investment. The value of their investment \nand their reputations as infrastructure investors are on the line. \nJ. Excess Investments by Minnesota Power \nThe Report also raises the complete opposite concern that the Acquisition will lead to \nexcessive investments by Minnesota Power.154 There is no foundation to these concerns, as the \nReport is simply speculating about diametrically opposite outcomes. Moreover, any significant \ninvestments require Commission approval. As previously noted, the Commission has controlled \nand will continue to control Minnesota Power’s investments through the integrated resource plan \nand certificate of need processes. \nThe fact that the Company and its investors are interested in making investments is neither \nnew nor a problem that is caused by the Acquisition. ALLETE’s current investors have the same \ninterest in making investments that the Partners would have after the Acquisition. The Commission \nhas been balancing that interest for decades, and is fully capable of continuing to do so after the \nAcquisition. The Report fails to adequately reflect and respect this regulatory process. \n \n154 Report at ¶¶ 186–87 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n \n43 K. “Untimely” Exit \nThe Report expresses a concern that the Partners may sell their ownership stake in \nALLETE.155 While it raises fears of a future sale, the Report does not identify any specific harm \nthat such a sale would cause. At the outset, the Partners do not have any specific plans to sell their \nownership in ALLETE at any specific time.156 The Partners did conduct financial analysis about \ndifferent hold periods, but that is the normal type of analysis that any responsible investor does \nwith any investment. Moreover, the Partners’ analysis reflected a number of long-term hold \nperiods, undermining arguments that the Partners are “typical” private equity that intend only to \nsell an asset quickly.157 \n Regardless, the Commission should not be swayed by fears about speculative impacts of a \nfuture sale, because any sale will have to receive approval from the Commission under Minn. Stat. \n§ 216B.50.158 The Commission will have to approve the timing and conditions of a sale, including \nthe identity of the new buyers. The Commission will have authority to place conditions – including \nthe Commission’s routine ban on recovery of acquisition premiums – on both the existing \ninvestors, the new investors, and the utility, if a sale occurs in the future. Concerns about \nunidentified and speculative harms are unfounded, because they will be fully within the \nCommission’s control. \nL. Affiliated Interests \nThe Report raises concerns that the Petitioners will not comply with the Minnesota’s \nAffiliated Interest requirements.159 These concerns are unfounded. The Affiliated Interest statute \n \n155 See id.  at Section IV.B.2. \n156 Ex. MP-31 at 51 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-09 ); Ex. MP-33 at 22 (Bram Rebuttal) (eDocket \nNo. 20253-216055-08 ). \n157 Ex. CURE-602, Schedule JB-9 at 20–22 (eDocket No. 20253-216818-07) (HCTS). \n158 Ex. MP-31 at 13 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-09 ); Ex. MP-33 at 23 (Bram Rebuttal) (eDocket \nNo. 20253-216055-08 ). \n159 See Report at Section IV.F.1 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n \n44 is a law and the Commission’s Rules regarding affiliated interests have the force of law. Petitioners \nunderstand that they will have the obligation to follow these requirements. \n Further, the Settlement contains additional commitments that will provide protections \nabove and beyond the Affiliated Interest statute. Settlement paragraphs 1.29 and 1.30 provide that \nMinnesota Power will establish a process to identify any vendors that have ties to the Partners. \nOnce vendors are identified, the utility will provide a specific compliance report about every \ncontract with such a vendor that is greater than $500,000, with a written certification that the \ncontract was negotiated at arms’ length. This will provide far more information for the \nCommission and the Department than is provided today by Minnesota Power and other utilities.160 \nImportantly, these reporting requirements are in addition to, and not a replacement of, existing \nlaws and rules. \nM. Commission’s Authority \nThe Report also suggests that the Commission will not have the authority to effectively \nregulate Minnesota Power after the acquisition.161 That is not the case. \n The Commission will continue to have all the regulatory authority it has now, and will \nregulate Minnesota Power’s rates, ROE, services, resource mix, and many other aspects of its \nbusiness. In addition, the Commission will have expanded authority over Minnesota Power’s \nservice quality and new authority to assess penalties if metrics are not satisfied. \nThe Report asserts that the Commission will not have the information it needs to use its \nauthority because it will no longer get Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports.162 \nThe Commission does not, however, delegate its regulatory responsibility to financial analysts at \n \n160 Ex. MP-35 at 11 (Anderson Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-06 ). \n161 Report at ¶ 244 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ); Report Memorandum at 72 (eDocket No. 20257-221061-02) \n(HCTS). \n162 Report at Section IV.D.1 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n \n45 the firms that report on the Company’s SEC reports – both the Commission and the Department \nhave professional staff who are trained and equipped to advise the Commission in making its \nregulatory decisions. In addition, the Settlement contains commitments to ensure that the \nCommission has access to the information it needs to do so. Settlement paragraphs 1.32 through \n1.39 provide that the Commission will have access to all books and records up to Alloy Parent \nrelated to the regulated utility business; access to all credit rating reports and documents; the \ninformation necessary to evaluate corporate, affiliate, or subsidiary transactions; certainty that \nseparate books and records will be maintained; and audited financial statements from Minnesota \nPower and Alloy Parent. Neither the Opposing Parties nor the Report identified any information \nthat the Commission would need that the Petitioners have not already committed to provide. \nIV. Minnesota Power Needs the Acquisition, Which is in the Public Interest. \nA. The Acquisition will Ensure that Minnesota Power Can Make the Investments \nCustomers Need. \nThe Report erroneously concludes that Minnesota Power has not established that there is a \nsignificant risk that the public markets will be unable to meet its capital needs.163 The Company \nfaces a critical need for capital investments in the years to come to modernize its infrastructure, \nmeet renewable energy goals, and ensure reliable service to its customers.164 The primary goal of \nthe Acquisition is to equip the Company with reliable access to equity capital necessary to finance \nthe investments in clean energy technologies needed to comply with the Carbon Free Standard.165 \nWithout the Acquisition, the Company’s compliance with the Carbon Free Standard would be \n \n163 Id. at ¶ 135 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n164 Ex. MP-9 at 13 (Cady Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-03 ); Ex. MP-10 at 11 (Scissons Direct) (eDocket No. \n202412-212968-04 ); Ex. MP-11 at 3, 7 (Taran Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-05 ). \n165 Ex. MP-9 at 7 (Cady Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-03 ). \n \n46 highly unlikely.166 The Acquisition is the path chosen by the Company (and not chosen lightly) as \nnecessary for the Company to satisfy the Carbon Free Standard while maintaining safe, reliable, \nand affordable service to Minnesota Power customers. \n1. Minnesota Power’s need for investments and equity capital is growing. \nALLETE needs to raise more than $1 billion in new equity to fund its expected investment \nrequirements over the next five years and even more in the following years.167 These investments \nare necessary to modernize and improve the transmission and distribution systems, continue to \nensure the provision of safe and reliable electricity to Minnesota Power customers, and continue \nto move Minnesota Power toward compliance with the Carbon Free Standard.168 In comparison, \nin the Company’s 75-year history in publicly traded markets, the Company has raised $1.3 billion \nin equity.169 It is not reasonable to assume that the Company can achieve that while relying on \npublic markets for financing.  \nSpecifically, the five-year investment plan is approximately 3.8 times larger than \nALLETE’s historical average.170 While ALLETE is one of the smallest utilities in the country by \nmarket capitalization,171 the Company’s need for equity capital is large in proportion to its market \ncapitalization.172 The evidence in the record demonstrates that ALLETE’s need for equity capital \nis the greatest of any publicly traded United States utility.173  \n \n166 Ex. MP-28 at 9–10 (Scissons Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-04 ) (“Given the Company’s size, access to \ncapital at the scale ALLETE has forecasted would be at very high risk, and if the current operating environment \n(including tariff impacts, large customer cyclicality, and policy uncertainty) remains, it would be highly unlikely  the \nCompany could achieve its carbon free goals as planned and other system investment (e.g., grid resilience investments \nand enhancements) would also be threatened.”) (emphasis added). \n167 Id. at 7. \n168 Ex.

MP-30 at Rebuttal Schedule 2 (Quackenbush Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-12 ). \n \n47 While ALLETE’s prior Form 10-K explains that these capital needs can be met, that \nstatement was premised on further exploration and development of options, including the \nAcquisition, and ultimately on both interim and long-term equity support from the Partners.174 \nFurther, the Form 10-K expressly detailed that access to capital was a risk factor that could affect \nthe Company’s “ability to execute its business plans, make capital expenditures, or pursue other \nstrategic actions.”175 In any event, this single statement in a Form 10-K has been superseded by \nthe Company’s further analysis to identify its approach to comply with the Carbon Free Standard.  \nWitness Taran explained that “[t]he Company, with extensive experience operating the \nutility, the benefit of experienced advisors, and the Company’s expertise in the markets, identified \na significant risk with accessing the amount of capital needed to execute its strategy and to achieve \nthe requirements of Minnesota policy.”176 As the Company’s Chief Financial Officer testified, it \nwould be “highly unlikely the Company could achieve its carbon free goals as planned and other \nsystem investment (e.g., grid resilience investments and enhancements) would also be \nthreatened.”177 Further, as Witness Quackenbush testified, “ALLETE is approaching a crucial \nperiod of accelerating capital needs to meet Minnesota policy goals but is constrained by its small \nsize and outsized capital plan.”178 This need for capital over the next five years is greater than what \nthe Company has needed to raise in its 75-year history.179 \n \n174 Evid.

The vast majority of ALLETE’s capital needs are for Minnesota Power. \nThe vast majority of ALLETE’s planned investments are for Regulated Operations for \nMinnesota Power.180 And within these investments for Minnesota Power, the largest anticipated \ninvestments are for transmission expansion projects ($1.8 billion), with $425 million for solar, \n$615 million for wind, and $445 million for storage resources. In short, the $3.3 billion for clean \nresources that are needed to meet the Carbon Free Standard, in addition to $1.3 billion of base \ncapital expenditures to maintain existing transmission and distribution systems and other facilities, \nas shown in Figure 1.181  \nA substantial portion of the investments required for the next five years, and the years \nbeyond, are related to transmission projects that have already been approved by the Commission \nand that the Company will need to fund.182 Many of the transmission expansion projects will be \nthose approved by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (“MISO”) where the costs \nof such projects will be allocated across applicable MISO cost zones – but the capital is still \nnecessary on the front-end to construct these facilities.183 \nFigure 1. ALLETE 2024 10-K Capital Expenditures184 \n \n \n180 Ex. MP-45 at 62 (ALLETE 2024 10-K) (eDocket No. 20253-216998-01 ). \n181 Ex.

MP-45 at 62 (ALLETE 2024 10-K) (eDocket No. 20253-216998-01 ). \n\n \n49 The scale of these investments will require a substantial change in how the Company \nfinances its projects. The Company’s 2025-2029 capital plan is projected to require investments \nthat exceed 100 percent of ALLETE’s total market capitalization.185 This means that the capital \ninvestments Minnesota Power plans to make over the next five years are greater than the current \nequity value of the entire Company.  \n3. The Company correctly recognized that continuing to rely on public \nmarkets was unlikely to be successful. \nThe Company’s experts, including its Chief Financial Officer, J.P. Morgan, and Houlihan \nLokey, concluded that it would not be reasonable to rely on public markets to meet this financing \nneed.186 As a result, without the Acquisition, compliance with the Carbon Free Standard would be \n“highly unlikely.”187 The Company’s Witness Quackenbush, an expert in regulatory transactions \nand capital needs of utilities and a former utility commissioner himself, confirmed this analysis in \nthe proceeding.188 Specifically, this significant gap between the Company’s market capitalization \nand its capital requirements highlights the need for a reliable and stable source of funding to meet \nits substantial investment goals.189 The Partners will provide that reliable supply of equity to \nsupport ALLETE’s capital needs without the risk of equity market volatility or the constraints of \nthe public markets.190 The Partners will be able to provide ready, flexible access to the equity \nnecessary for the Company’s utility investments, reinforced by the above commitments.191 \n \n185 Ex.

In January 2025, US Steel, Minnesota \nPower’s largest single customer, provided a four-year notice that it would terminate its electric \nservice agreement with Minnesota Power.197 On March 20, 2025, Cleveland-Cliffs, Minnesota \nPower’s second-largest customer, announced that it would idle two mines in Minnesota Power’s \n \n192 Report at ¶ 135 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n193 Ex.

The negative impacts of issuing many more shares, such as the \nsignificant drain on cash flows, are not described in the Report. \nWhile other parties speculated that public markets may provide adequate capital to the \nCompany, they provided no quantification or other evidence that this is a reasonable conclusion200 \nand operated from an academic perspective rather than with the utility’s (and the utility’s advisors’, \nPartners’, and expert Quackenbush’s combined) expertise and real-world experience.201 \nThe Acquisition provides the solution to the circumstances facing Minnesota Power.

The Report’s Finding that the Company Selected the Partners Based Solely on \nthe Bid Price is Factually Incorrect. \nThe Report focused on the last steps of negotiation between the Company and the Partners \nin February and March 2024, in which the Partners increased their purchase price from $62.50 per \nshare to $67 per share.202 The Report takes the position that those negotiations mean that the \nCompany sought the highest possible sale price so as to benefit shareholders at the expense of the \npublic interest.203 That argument reflects a false dichotomy and must be rejected. As described in \npre-filed testimony, the end of the negotiation process was nothing more than the result of highly \nexperienced negotiators, each seeing a common interest and path forward and exercising their \nfiduciary obligations to bargain for the best final price after determining they would be the best \npartners going forward.204  \n1. The Company did not solely seek the maximum price for an acquisition. \nAs noted by Witness Scissons, if the Company had wanted to maximize its sale price it \ncould have undertaken an entirely different approach, such as an open sale process allowing all \nbidders.205 Instead, the Company categorically excluded bidders who would not have been a good \nfit, even if they would have offered a higher price. The Company specifically chose to focus on \ninfrastructure and pension funds because ALLETE’s Board of Directors – which had and continues \nto have fiduciary duties to the Company in selecting these Partners and this Acquisition – “believed \nsuch parties would have the financial resources to invest in the substantial future capital growth \n \n202 CUB Initial Brief at 16–18 (eDocket No. 20255-218534-01 ); Department Initial Brief at 18–19 (eDocket No. \n20255-218500-01 ). \n203 Report at 17–19 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n204 Ex. MP-28 at 3–4 (Scissons Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-04 ). \n205 Id. at 3. \n \n53 needs of the Company and because of concerns that strategic buyers, which may not be willing to \npartner with the Company to support regulatory goals in Minnesota and Wisconsin in light of focus \non separate interests, could be less attractive investors from a regulatory perspective.”206 In \naddition, the negotiation process demonstrates that ALLETE successfully balanced all \nconsiderations, obtaining access to “patient” capital from precisely the type of investors it was \nlooking for; assurances that protect consumers and the community; and a price per share that would \nsupport shareholder approval of this path forward. \n2. The Company properly considered multiple interests in selecting the \nPartners. \nDespite implications to the contrary in the ALJ Report, there was nothing inappropriate or \nanti-consumer about any of this process and considering shareholder value does not ignore \ncustomers. To the contrary, it is axiomatic that a public utility such as Minnesota Power has duties \nboth to its stockholders and to its customers and can consider both, concurrently, in its decision-\nmaking.207 Further, this process is entirely consistent with negotiation processes undertaken by \npublicly traded companies to ensure compliance with a myriad of SEC regulations and rules.208 \nThe process demonstrates that the ALLETE Board of Directors did an excellent job of balancing \nits duties, designing the process so that only appropriate investors aligned with the Company’s \nvalues would be involved, so as to protect and serve its customers and community. Within this \nframework, the Company also took steps to assure that shareholders would find the transaction \n \n206 Ex. MP-1 at 41 (Initial Filing – Petition for Approval, Attachment L) (eDocket No. 20247-208768-01 ). \n207 See, e.g. , Fed. Power Comm’n v. Hope Nat’l Gas , 320 U.S. 591, 603 (1944) (describing how ratemaking involves \na balancing of investor and consumer interests and emphasizing that “the return to the equity owner should be \ncommensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks”). Similarly, the \nCommission’s regulation of Minnesota Power must maintain the appropriate balance between customer interests and \nstockholder interests. See, e.g. , In re Interstate Power Co ., 574 N.W.2d 408, 411 (Minn. 1988) (describing the \nCommission’s statutory mandate relating to rate regulation as “broadly defined in terms of balancing the interests of \nthe utility companies, their shareholders, and their customers”). \n208 Joint Reply Brief at 39 (eDocket No. 20255-219384-02 ). \n \n54 attractive and would support it. This detailed, thoughtful, and thorough effort and the result \ndemonstrate that the ALLETE leadership team precisely deployed all of its expertise and resources \nto arrive at the right solution for the Company, its workforce, its shareholders, and its customers.  \n3. The Company properly considered the standalone plan, but concluded that \nAcquisition by the Partners was the better path. \nThe suggestion of the Opposing Parties, as adopted by the Report’s analysis, is that by \nrejecting a previous offer by the Partners, ALLETE “opted to pursue” the standalone plan and \nrisked losing the agreement with GIP and CPP Investments.209 But the Opposing Parties and the \nALJ were not there and are in no position to second-guess the complex considerations and \njudgment calls that ALLETE’s Board worked through, all while subject to Minnesota fiduciary \nobligations to the company the Board serves. \nFurther, ALLETE never “opted to pursue” the standalone plan. Rather, the Proxy \nStatement, read as a whole, shows that ALLETE’s Board at most “prepared” to move forward with \nthe standalone plan after  CPP Investments and GIP signaled to ALLETE that they would not \nincrease their price.210 Ultimately, this argument is based on a false alternative: if ALLETE was \nmaximizing the price to be paid, it must have been harming customers. But these objectives are \nnot opposed, because the Company is obligated to balance both objectives and did so here.  \nC. Rejecting the Acquisition Would Pose Profound Risks to the Public Interest \nThe Report fails to address the risks associated with rejecting the Acquisition. While the \nReport discusses harms and risks that the Acquisition could  have on the public interest, it does not \nconsider the far-reaching and profound consequences that rejection could have on the public \n \n209 CUB Initial Brief at 18 (eDocket No. 20255-218534-01 ). \n210 Ex. MP-1 at 51 (Initial Filing – Petition for Approval, Attachment L) (eDocket No. 20247-208768-01 ). The Board \nwas obligated to make alternate preparations as best it could. Note that the record does not contain any corporate \naction taken by ALLETE to act on the standalone plan. Just because a plan exists does not make it the best or preferable \ncourse of action. \n \n55 interest, particularly in light of Minnesota Power’s increasing capital investment needs and recent \nmarket pressures on ALLETE and its customer base.211 The Report further dismisses out-of-hand \nthe demonstrable and significant financial benefits that the Acquisition will have  on Minnesota \nPower’s customers, various stakeholders, and the public interest because of the commitments \ncontained within the Settlement. In fact, there is a significant risk that rejecting the Acquisition \ncould meaningfully harm Minnesota Power and its customers.  \n1. ALLETE’s reliance on the public equity markets is not in the public interest. \nAs previously discussed, the rejection of the Acquisition would force Minnesota Power to \nseek funding through public equity markets at a time when capital requirements are set to grow \nsignificantly. It would be risky to rely on public equity markets to finance the investments that \ncustomers need, particularly for a relatively small company with unique and outsized customer \nconcentration risk that has been amply demonstrated by recent events. If the Company cannot \nfinance the investments customers need, or cannot do so at a reasonable cost, it could have negative \nimpacts on service quality, rates, and compliance with the Carbon Free Standard. The Report does \nnot measure these risks at all. The Report’s failure to consider the gravity of these risks \ndemonstrates that it does not adequately consider what is in the public interest. \nThe existence of this risk is demonstrated on the record and, in fact, is the entire reason the \nCompany decided to look for private owners that shared the Company’s long-run vision and \nvalues. Witness Taran testified that “ALLETE would have difficulty raising the amounts of capital \nMinnesota Power will need in the future without the Acquisition”212 and that “[a]ttempting to issue \nthis level of equity in public markets creates an enormous amount of risk for the Company and its \n \n211 See Report at Section IV (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n212 Ex. MP-11 at 7–8 (Taran Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212968-05 ). \n \n56 stakeholders.”213 Witness Taran also testified that it would not be responsible for the Company to \nmove forward on the assumption that it could rely on the public markets for equity capital given \nits obligation to provide safe and reliable service to customers.214 Other experts provided similar \nevidence: \n Witness Scissons testified that “it would be highly unlikely the Company could \nachieve its carbon free goals as planned” without the Acquisition.215 \n Witness Quackenbush agreed that ALLETE would face severe challenges \naccessing the required equity from public markets.216 \n Witness Bram testified that “[t]he idea that ALLETE could access public equity at \nthe scale and pace that is needed is not based on reality and would likely result in \nsignificant challenges for the utility.”217 \nThe only contrary testimony from Opposing Parties is not based on their witnesses’ actual \nexperience trying to raise public equity (as they have none), but is based on theories in textbooks \nthat are at best tangentially related to the question. Moreover, even those textbooks acknowledge \nthat relying on public markets would mean much lower stock prices in issuances, which as \nexplained by Witness Quackenbush would have adverse effects not only on stockholders but on \nthe Company and its customers.218  \n \n213 Ex. MP-29 at 18 (Taran Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-05 ). \n214 Id. \n215 Ex. MP-28 at 9–10 (Scissons Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-04 ). \n216 Ex. MP-12 at 17 (Quackenbush Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212972-01 ); Ex. MP-30 at 17–18 (Quackenbush \nRebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-12 ). \n217 Ex. MP-33 at 11 (Bram Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-08 ). \n218 Ex. MP-12 at 17 (Quackenbush Direct) (eDocket No. 202412-212972-01 ); Ex. MP-30 at 17–18 (Quackenbush \nRebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-12 ). \n \n57 2. The likelihood of higher costs in public equity markets is not in the public \ninterest. \nEven if the Company can finance all of the investments it needs based on public equity \nmarkets, there is a high probability that doing so would be far more expensive for Minnesota Power \nand its customers. Increased financing costs would be passed on to customers through rates.219 \nActing as a continuous serial issuer would likely increase flotation costs and require a larger \ninvestor relations budget, which are passed on to customers.220 As additional shares are issued, \nincreasing dividend obligations would put a burden on the Company’s cash flow, driving down its \ncredit ratings and increasing other borrowing costs.221 It would also force the Company to \nunreasonably dilute the shares of its existing shareholders to their detriment,222 which could also \nmake future issuances even more challenging.  \nIn addition, if the Acquisition is denied, the Company would be doing all of this under the \nspecter of a failed transaction, which could negatively impact the market’s willingness to support \nthe Company. The idea that the Acquisition can be rejected, and the Company can continue going \nforward in the same way it has historically, is not plausible or realistic. Without the Acquisition, \nMinnesota Power would have severe challenges complying with the Carbon Free Standard, as \nWitness Scissons noted.223 It is also very likely that challenges in financing investments would \nresult in higher costs and upward pressure on customer rates.  \n \n219 There is the risk of other significant effects on customers as well. As noted by the Minnesota State Building & \nConstruction Trades Council, inability to secure adequate capital “could create deployment delays that threaten the \nutility’s ability to meet requirements, maintain reliability and/or take advantage of favorable market conditions and \navoid unfavorable conditions,” increase costs by giving third parties leverage to “extract premiums in cases where the \nutility could have provided a more cost-effective option,” and adversely affect workers through project delays and \ncancellations as well as less favorable third-party hiring practices.” Minnesota State Building & Construction Trades \nCouncil Comments at 2 (Apr. 16, 2025) (eDocket No. 20254-217797-01 ). \n220 Partner Initial Post-Hearing Brief at 28 (eDocket No. 20255-218522-01 ). \n221 Id. at 29. \n222 Id.; see Ex. MP-30 at 14 (Quackenbush Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-12 ). \n223 Ex. MP-28 at 9 (Scissons Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-04 ). \n \n58 3. The Report’s willingness to rely on delays and reduced compliance with the \nCarbon Free Standard is not consistent with state policy. \nThe Report dismisses this evidence without any serious evaluation. And, even worse, the \nReport appears to reject the fact that denying the Acquisition could have an impact on Minnesota \nPower’s customers. The Report suggests that it would be acceptable if compliance with the Carbon \nFree Standard were delayed or faced “complication[s].”224 Petitioners disagree. The Company – \nwhich has expertise and responsibility to make these decisions – sought out this Acquisition \nbecause it determined that it could not meet its obligations without improved financing to make \nthe investments its customers need. That decision was based on careful analysis. While reasonable \npeople could disagree about the magnitude of the risk, it is fundamentally unreasonable to pretend \nthat there is no risk in rejection of the Acquisition. And when it comes to the Company’s obligation \nto serve customers and comply with the Carbon Free Standard, the risk of rejection is too high. \nV. The Commitments in the Settlement Will Create Substantial Public Benefits That \nWere Not Adequately Evaluated in the Report. \nThe Acquisition will result in a wide range of benefits to the public interest as a result of \nthe commitments offered by the Petitioners, including the new commitments in the Settlement \nreached with the Department. The Report does not analyze or recognize the benefits of the \ncommitments made during the contested case proceeding, but rather simply disregards them.  \nA. The Settlement and Other Commitments Produce Significant Benefits for the \nPublic Interest. \nDespite the Report’s quick dismissal of the Settlement, a closer analysis demonstrates that \nthe Settlement and other commitments offered during the proceeding go beyond the requirement \nthat the Acquisition be “consistent with the public interest” and, in fact, will provide benefits that \nwould not be available to Minnesota Power customers and the State of Minnesota absent the \n \n224 Report Memorandum at 72–73 (eDocket No. 20257-221061-02) (HCTS). \n \n59 Acquisition. It is critical that these benefits be properly evaluated, as they will not be obtained \nunless the Acquisition is approved. \n1. Improved Financing  \nThe Report raises concerns that the Acquisition will not actually improve the Company’s \naccess to capital and may decrease access to equity.225 While those concerns are unfounded, the \nSettlement includes commitments that further ensure that the Company will have the equity capital \nit needs after the Acquisition is approved. \nThe Settlement will achieve the primary purpose of the Acquisition by ensuring that \nMinnesota Power can finance the investments it needs to make to serve its customers. To make \nthis happen, the Settlement includes the commitment that the Company will be provided \nguaranteed equity financing to fully support Minnesota Power’s five-year capital investment plan \ndetailed in the Company’s February 2025 10-K filing.226 This secured equity infusion ensures \nstable financing for essential clean energy infrastructure projects, eliminating the risk of \ndependence on volatile public equity markets and associated risks of higher financing costs for \ncustomers. \nThis commitment is very substantial. To fund Minnesota Power’s five-year capital plan, \nthe Company projects it would need to raise approximately $1 billion through follow-on common \nequity offerings over the next five years.227 As described above, the Company does not believe it \n \n225 Report at ¶ 135 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ); Report Memorandum at 72–73 (eDocket No. 20257-221061-02) \n(HCTS). \n226 Settlement at 1.3 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n227 MP-29 at 4–5 (Taran Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-05 ). The $1.8 billion in capital necessary for \ntransmission projects is in addition to amounts necessary to implement generation projects that the Commission has \neither already approved or that are currently before the Commission for consideration to comply with the \nCommission’s 2021 Integrated Resource Plan Order such as the Regal Solar Project and the Boswell Solar Project. \n \n60 can do this while relying on public markets.228 This substantial financial commitment is a critical \nbenefit to Minnesota Power’s customers. \nThe Settlement also meaningfully enhances the capital commitment by including a strong \nenforcement mechanism. In paragraphs 1.4 and 1.5 of the Settlement, the Partners have committed \nthat if they are not in compliance with the capital commitment, the Partners will not receive \ndividends from the Company. The Settlement also commits that the Company will work with the \nDepartment to develop the methods for reporting compliance. \nImportantly, public market investors do not make binding, forward-looking capital \ncommitments to an issuer or its customers.229 Public investors may acquire shares in large \nquantities without undertaking any obligations to provide additional equity when needed or to \nsupport customer benefits.  \nThe Partners’ returns likewise depend on the infusion of new capital, on Commission \napproval of specific investments and associated cost recovery, and on the Commission’s \ndetermination of an appropriate return on utility assets. These factors will continue to apply after \nthe initial five-year period. \n While the Report adopted the Opposing Parties’ proposed findings that ALLETE could \nsimply defer dividends or issue more debt, it failed to recognize that public market investors do \nnot invest in a company without anticipated dividends – especially for utility companies, where \nstable returns are a hallmark of the attractiveness of the investment category.230 Issuing more debt \nalso does not resolve this issue, because it could create other harms that were specifically identified \n \n228 Id. \n229 See the discussion in Section III.A, herein, discussing the possibility of a shareholder or group of shareholders \ntaking a controlling interest in ALLETE by acquiring shares through public markets. Such an acquisition would not \nbe subject to Commission approval. These shareholders could then take control of the ALLETE Board of Directors \nwithout making any of the significant commitments available through the Acquisition. \n230 Ex. MP-31 at 20–21 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-09 ); Ex. MP-33 at 14 (Bram Rebuttal) (eDocket \nNo. 20253-216055-08 ); Ex. MP-27 at Schedule 1 Page 1 of 7 (Cady Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-03 ). \n \n61 by the Department and other parties.231 As discussed by the Department in testimony, excessive \ndebt can over-leverage the Company, including the Minnesota Power utility, drive down credit \nmetrics and therefore credit ratings, and ultimately raise the cost of capital for customers.232 The \ncapital commitment established in the Settlement is a more reasonable and prudent solution to the \nfinancing problem than any alternatives suggested in the record. \n2. Clean Firm Technology Fund  \nThe Report raises concerns regarding the Petitioners’ commitment to the Carbon Free \nStandard.233 As discussed above, the Partners’ internal documents demonstrate that their interests \nare fully aligned with the Carbon Free Standard. In addition, new commitments in the Settlement \nfurther demonstrate this commitment. The Settlement includes new commitments to invest in the \nclean energy transition. Paragraph 1.63 of the Settlement establishes a Clean Firm Technology \nFund (the “Fund”) with $50 million provided by Alloy Parent and recorded as a regulatory \nliability.234 This $50 million will not be recoverable from Minnesota Power customers. The Fund \nis structured to deliver durable, schedule certain support for long duration, dispatchable, carbon \nfree resources – precisely the category of solutions that the Department has identified as critical to \nmeeting Minnesota’s 2040 Carbon Free Standard. No other utility investor has made this type of \ncommitment. \n This commitment will explicitly reduce the cost of a resource selected to meet the needs of \ncustomers in the future. The rate impact will likely be greater than $50 million in the long term, as \nParagraph 1.63 provides that there will be no return on capital or depreciation for the $50 million \ngrant. The grant demonstrates the Petitioners’ commitment to the Carbon Free Standard, their \n \n231 Ex. DOC-304 at 36–37 (Addonizio Surrebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216799-01 ). \n232 Id.; Ex. DOC-303 at 15–17 (Addonizio Direct) (eDocket No. 20252-214941-01 ). \n233 Report at ¶¶ 185–87 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n234 Settlement at 1.63 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n \n62 interest in working cooperatively to identify creative solutions in meeting the Carbon Free \nStandard and will meaningfully mitigate rate impacts for customers in the future. \n3. Rate Case Stay Out \nThe Report asserts that the Acquisition could impact rates charged to Minnesota Power’s \ncustomers.235 Petitioners have made several new commitments in the Settlement that ensure this \nwill not be the case, and in fact that rate increases will be avoided. Paragraph 1.43 of the Settlement \nstates that Minnesota Power waives its right to file a rate case before November 1, 2026.236 Absent \nthis commitment, the Company would likely be preparing to file a rate case in the near future given \ncost increases and changes in customer sales. \nIn January 2025, US Steel, Minnesota Power’s largest single customer, provided a four-\nyear notice that it would terminate its electric service agreement with Minnesota Power.237 On \nMarch 20, 2025, Cleveland-Cliffs, Minnesota Power’s second-largest customer, announced that it \nwould idle two mines in Minnesota Power’s service territory, and lay off more than 600 workers.238  \nThe Commission is aware that such changes have historically caused Minnesota Power to \nfile a rate case shortly thereafter. As described by the Department in the cover letter accompanying \nthe Settlement dated July 11, 2025, the Department ascribes the value of a one-year rate case stay-\nout to be roughly an incremental $25 million (the Company believes the value is significantly \nhigher), independent of the ROE change described below.239   \n4. Rate Reduction \nThe Settlement further addresses rate concerns raised in the Report by ensuring that there \nwill be a reduction in current rates once the Acquisition closes. Paragraph 1.43 of the Settlement \n \n235 Report at ¶¶ 217–22 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n236 Settlement at 1.43 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n237 Ex. MP-30 at 9 (Quackenbush Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-12 ). \n238 Ex. MP-40 at 4, n. 6 (Cady Surrebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216810-02 ). \n239 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Settlement Cover Letter at 2 (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257-220879-02 ). \n \n63 states that Minnesota Power’s currently-approved ROE will be reduced from 9.78 percent to 9.65 \npercent.240 The change in ROE will take effect the first full month after both of the following have \noccurred: (i) the close of the Acquisition and (ii) when the order of the Commission becomes final. \nThe 9.65 percent ROE will remain in effect until Minnesota Power files its next rate case and will \nbe used to set interim rates in Minnesota Power’s next Minnesota rate case.  \nThis commitment means that rates paid by customers will be reduced following the \nAcquisition, resulting in immediate benefits for customers. Further, Paragraph 1.43 was \nspecifically crafted to make sure that the benefit of the reduced ROE lasts for a long time, by \nensuring the reduced ROE will be used to set interim rates in the next rate case.241 Over that \nduration, Petitioners estimate that the ROE reduction will save customers approximately $7.6 \nmillion. As such, this commitment provides real, immediate rate reduction benefits to Minnesota \nPower’s customers, which is consistent with the public interest. \n5. Service Quality  \nThe Report also suggests, without evidence, that the Acquisition could lead to reduced \nservice quality for customers.242 The Petitioners disagree and note that the findings in that section \ndo not have much to do with service quality. Regardless, to show their commitment to service \nquality, the Petitioners have made a substantial commitment to expand the Commission’s authority \nover service quality and demonstrate that the Petitioners are fully aligned with providing high-\nquality service for customers. Paragraph 1.64 establishes new Safety, Reliability, and Service \nQuality (“SRSQ”) metrics for Minnesota Power that align with its SRSQ docket and may change \n \n240 This includes Minnesota Power’s commitment not to seek recovery of flotation costs but extends that commitment \nto the closing of the Acquisition rather than waiting until implementation with the next rate case. \n241 Minn. Stat. § 216B.16, subd. 3(a) (providing that interim rates are set using the “rate of return . . . authorized by \nthe commission in the utility’s most recent rate proceeding”). In contrast, Petitioners have committed that the next rate \nproceeding will use an ROE of 9.65 percent to establish interim rates instead of the 9.78 percent that would be allowed \nunder law. \n242 Report at ¶¶ 223–28 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n \n64 if Commission rules or SRSQ metrics change. And, for the first time, the Company will be subject \nto financial penalties if it does not achieve the new metrics. Beginning one year after the \nAcquisition closes and enforceable after two years, a $250,000 underperformance payment is \ntriggered for each failure.243 Underperformance payments would not be recoverable and would be \nsplit between customer credits and reinvestments to fix the cause.  \nThe specific categories and triggers for the metrics were negotiated with the Department \nto ensure that they target measurements and performance levels that add meaningful protections \nfor customers. Similarly, the amount of underpayment penalties was negotiated such that it will \nhave a meaningful impact on the Company’s incentives.  \nThe SRSQ metrics provide substantial public interest benefits and mitigate many of the \nconcerns expressed in the Report. The Report suggests that the Acquisition could impair the \nCompany’s financial health in a way that affects service quality,244 or that the Partners could have \nincentives that are not aligned with that of customers.245 Petitioners maintain that the Acquisition \nwill have no negative impact on customer service quality, but have now agreed to financial \nexposure to demonstrate their level of commitment. Following approval of the Acquisition, the \nCommission will have regular reporting on the new metrics, which will provide visibility on any \npotential impacts to service quality. And the substantial underperformance payments align the \nincentives of the Company, the Partners, and customers in ensuring that Minnesota Power \ncontinues to provide high quality service. \nCritically, the service quality commitments are something that the Commission could not \nrequire outside of the Acquisition. The Commission does not have legal authority to assess \n \n243 Settlement at 1.14 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n244 Report at ¶ 226 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n245 Id. at ¶ 228. \n \n65 penalties to utilities for service quality issues. The public interest benefits of the new service \nquality commitments can occur only with the approval of the Acquisition. \n6. Low-Income Cost Protections  \nDespite the Report’s suggestion that the Petitioners intend to increase rates in ways that \nharm customers,246 Petitioners have agreed to further commitments that will protect the most \nvulnerable customers from rate issues. The Settlement provides significant, tangible, and \nimmediate commitments that are rarely made by a utility’s investors, as nonpayment of arrearages \nare usually borne by other utility customers (including industrial, other residential, and small \ncommercial customers) and can raise costs (e.g., bad debt expense) for the utility. Further, \nforgiving residential arrearages in the manner described here will make a material difference in \nthe lives of Minnesota Power’s low-income and most vulnerable customers. These commitments \nensure that low-income customers will continue to have access to affordability assistance \nconsistent with current levels, directly addressing concerns about affordability for residential \ncustomers.247 This commitment is an historic, investor-paid benefit to the Company’s most \nvulnerable customers that is not presently available, and it is not clear Minnesota Power could \nmake or would be able to make such a commitment absent the Acquisition and the Partners’ \nassociated commitment of funds.248 \nSpecifically, to support these customers, the Partners have committed to maintaining the \ncurrent CARE affordability program and providing up to $3.5 million in direct financial support \nto reduce residential customer arrearages to pre-pandemic levels or better.249 Additionally, \n \n246 Id. at ¶¶ 212–22. \n247 Ex. MP-27 at 25 (Cady Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-03 ). \n248 $3.5 million is the level of customer arrearages. During the hearing, CUB implied this number would be less by \nmixing tracker balances with arrearage levels. Evid. Hr. Tr. at 193:20–195:21 (Apr. 1, 2025); Evid. Hr. Tr. at 759:1–\n23 (Apr. 3, 2025). However, even if the level were closer to $1 million, as implied by CUB, this would still be an \nhistoric level of commitment that is not available from public shareholders.   \n249 Settlement at 1.48 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n \n66 Petitioners have affirmed the broad applicability of statutory budget billing protections, ensuring \ninclusive access to affordability programs for all residential customers.250 Collectively, these \ncomprehensive and enforceable commitments mitigate risks and proactively offer substantial, \nmeasurable benefits, justifying the Commission finding the Acquisition is consistent with the \npublic interest. \n7. Workforce and Labor Protections \nThe Settlement with the Department incorporates workforce and labor protections the \nCompany and Partners agreed to with IBEW Local 31, LIUNA, the Operators and Carpenters \nUnions.251 Specifically, Minnesota Power’s longstanding commitment to prioritizing local union \nlabor on construction contracts and requiring contractors and subcontractors to pay their workers \nprevailing wage as evidenced by local collective bargaining agreements will continue.252  \n The Company also worked with IBEW Local 31 to extend the Collective Bargaining \nAgreement for Minnesota Power employees for a period of two years, starting in January 2026.253 \nThrough negotiations with IBEW Local 31 the Company also agreed to execute a Neutrality \nAgreement.254 Taken together, these commitments reinforce Minnesota Power’s longstanding \ncommitment to its employees and organized labor and are made possible because of the \nAcquisition and the Partners.  \n8. Other Benefits \nThe Settlement also provides other benefits that are responsive to the concerns identified \nin the Report. For example, the Report claims that the Acquisition will result in reduced \n \n250 Id. at 1.49. \n251 Id. at 1.56–1.62. \n252 Id. \n253 MP-37 at 5 (Krollman Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253-216055-07 ). \n254 Id. \n \n67 transparency.255 But Settlement Paragraphs 1.32 through 1.39 ensure that the Commission will \nhave access to the information it needs to execute its regulatory authority, guaranteeing access to \nrelevant books and records, and regularly filed financial statements from Partner entities in \naddition to ALLETE.256  \nParties raised concerns about the separation between Minnesota Power and ALLETE’s \nnon-regulated subsidiaries.257 Although that issue is not new, and not directly caused by or related \nto the Acquisition, the Petitioners have made a commitment to respond to the concerns. Paragraph \n1.27 commits to filing a petition regarding the formation of a holding company for Minnesota \nPower, which would separate the regulated utility from the rest of the ALLETE structure. If \napproved, the holding company structure would protect the regulated utility from impacts of \nALLETE’s existing nonregulated businesses.258 \nThe Report expresses concerns that the commitments previously offered by Partners are \ninsufficient to protect against dealing with vendors that are otherwise associated with the \nPartners.259 Paragraph 1.29 is directly responsive to this concern. First, it confirms that the vendor \nreporting commitment previously offered is in addition to, not a replacement of, existing affiliated \ninterest requirements. It also provides enhancements to the vendor reporting commitment, \nreducing the reporting threshold from $1 million to $500,000. As a result, additional vendor \ncontracts will be subject to reporting and the Commission, and the Department will have improved \nvisibility into Minnesota Power’s contracting.260 \n \n255 Report at ¶¶ 235–44 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n256 Settlement at 1.32–1.39 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n257 Ex. DOC-301 at 20 (Vavro Direct) (eDocket No. 20252-214941-05 ). \n258 Settlement at 1.27 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n259 Report at ¶¶ 267–71 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n260 Settlement at 1.29 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n \n68 The Report also describes concerns regarding the ALLETE’s Board of Directors, \nsuggesting that there may not be sufficient oversight following the Acquisition.261 Petitioners have \nagreed to meaningful commitments related to the composition of ALLETE’s Board that address \nthese concerns. The Settlement also contains meaningful concessions regarding the composition \nof ALLETE’s Board of Directors, responding directly to concerns raised on the record about \nensuring alignment between ALLETE and its new investors. To ensure that local and independent \nvoices are recognized, the Board will include six “independent” directors, as defined by the New \nYork Stock Exchange, in addition to previous commitments.262 And the independent directors will \nneed to separately agree before ALLETE or Minnesota Power can be placed into voluntary \nbankruptcy.263 \nThrough cooperation with the Department, the Petitioners have reached agreement in the \nSettlement on a set of commitments that will provide meaningful public interest benefits to \nMinnesota Power’s customers, by reducing rates, delaying potential rate increases, aligning the \ninterests of the new investors with customers, and granting the Commission additional tools to \nensure good service quality. With these benefits, the Acquisition is clearly in the public interest \nand should be approved; if the Acquisition is rejected, as recommended by the Report, all of these \nbenefits will be lost. \nB. The Settlement Commitments Match or Exceed Commitments for other \nAcquisitions that have been Approved. \nThe Report claims that financial commitments in acquisitions in other states under different \nstatutes and circumstances and not by the same Partners should be determinative in the evaluation \nof the Acquisition. Specifically, the Report focuses on the acquisitions of Puget, El Paso, and South \n \n261 Report at ¶¶ 264–66 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n262 Settlement at 1.23(b) (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). \n263 Id. at 1.28. \n \n69 Jersey, claiming the financial commitments exceed the value of the financial commitments agreed \nto by the Petitioners in this case.264 But the Report simply offers a raw dollar comparison, failing \nto account for the substantial differences in the relative size and scale of the different utilities being \ncompared. As a simple illustration, financial commitments worth $100 for 100 customers may well \nbe more meaningful than a commitment of $1,000 for 10,000 customers. Therefore, the Report’s \nclaim about the value of ALLETE’s commitments relative to the other three utilities does not \nprovide a reasoned analysis and is misleading at best.  \nAttachment C provides a comparison that accounts for differences among the compared \ntake-private utilities in equity value and number of customers. As such, it provides a direct \ncomparison of the ALLETE transaction to the three other take-private utilities referred to in the \nReport. Attachment C also compares these utilities in relation to other commitments that are not \nquantifiable in dollars. This comparison shows that the Petitioners’ commitments compare \nfavorably to all three of the other take-private utility commitments. \nTable 1. Financial Commitments from Transactions Referenced in Report265 \n \nThis information demonstrates that, with the additional commitments in the Settlement, the \nPetitioners have actually offered far more financial commitments than in other transactions that \n \n264 Report ¶ 180 (eDocket No. 20257-221020-01 ). \n265 Attachment C. \n\n \n70 have been approved. Perhaps more importantly, the commitments per customer are much higher, \nreflecting that Minnesota Power has fewer customers than the other utilities the Report evaluated, \nas demonstrated in Figure 2 . \nFigure 2. Value of Financial Commitments per Customer266 \n \nThe financial commitments offered by Petitioners have an estimated value of $685 per customer, \nwhich is substantially higher than the per-customer financial commitments in the El Paso, South \nJersey, and Puget Sound cases cited in the Report,  \nThe Petitioners’ commitments in this case compare even more favorably when accounting \nfor the commitment to contribute $50 million to a clean firm fund to help facilitate Minnesota \nPower’s decarbonization efforts, along with the $3.8 million commitment to extend the existing \ncollective bargaining agreement and extend terms to nonunion employes. Moreover, the \nPetitioners have committed in the Settlement to extensive service quality standards with associated \npenalties that provide further substantial value to the Acquisition.267 Two of the three comparative \ntake-private mergers referred to in the Report have no service quality standard commitments and \nnone of the three include any commitments to reduce their previously determined ROE or extend \nexisting labor contracts. \n \n266 Id. \n267 Settlement at 1.64 (eDocket No. 20257-220879-01 ). $179 \n$38 $147 $685 \n–$100$200$300$400$500$600$700$800$900\nEL PASO PUGET SJI ALLETE\n \n71 VI.
