Based on  this \nevidence, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) correctly recognized that the Acquisition  is not \nin the public interest, setting out her factual findings and legal conclusions in a thorough and well-supported report (“ALJ Report”) which recommended denial of the Acquisition .\n1  \nIn the face of this evidence, the Compa ny and the Partners (together, “Petitioners”) \nattempt to discredit the ALJ Report, misstate the legal standard, mischaracterize the factual record, and greatly overstate the effects of the very limited commitments contained in the Proposed Settlement with the Department of Commerce (“DOC”).\n2 Many of the commitments in \nthe Proposed Settlement are illusory, and it does not offer any benefits sufficient to tip the balance in favor of approval. The Commission should not allow Petitioners’ tactics to distract from the essential facts of this case: while the proposed Acquisition  might be lucrative for the \nPartners or for ALLET E’s current shareholders, the record shows that it is a bad deal for \n                         \n1 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Administrative Law Judge’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of \nLaw, and Recommendations at 3, 61 ¶ 15, 62 ¶ 1, 66, 67 (July 15, 2025) (hereinafter “ALJ \nReport”) . \n2 See Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Exceptions of Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board, and Global Infrastructure Partners (Aug. 4, 2025) (hereinafter “Petitioner \nExceptions”); Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Settlement Stipulation Between Minnesota Department of Commerce, ALLETE, Inc.

The Commission should adopt the ALJ Report, reject the Proposed \nSettlement, and disapprove the Acquisition . \nI. THE ALJ REPORT IS IMPARTIAL,  FAIR, AND THOROUGH.   \nThe ALJ Report reaches well -supported, carefully reasoned conclusions based on a \nthorough and impartial review of the evidence in this proceeding. Because Petitioners disagree \nwith the ALJ’s conclusions, they attempt to discredit the ALJ Report by baselessly suggesting \nthat the report is somehow one-sided or unfair, or that the ALJ failed to consider the evidence offered by Petitioners.\n3 This i s nonsense.  \nThe record in this case includes hundreds of pages of testimony put forward by twenty-\ntwo witnesses, including eleven witnesses sponsored by Petitioners. The ALJ held a three -day \nevidentiary hearing  and received two rounds of briefing by the parties. The ALJ Report makes \nclear that the ALJ carefully considered all of the evidence, including evidence put forward by Petitioners, not just the evidence favorable to Intervenors. The ALJ Report includes ex tensive \ndiscussion of Petitioners’ evidence and Petitioners’ contentions throughout its analysis of each issue.\n4 The ALJ did not ignore Petitioners’ evidence—rather, she carefully weighed the \ncredibility of the testimony and evidence offered by each party,  and ultimately determined that \nPetitioners’ evidence on several key issues was less credible than that offered by Intervenors.5 \nThe ALJ elaborated on the basis for these credibility determinations.6 While the Commission \n                         \n3 Petitioner Exceptions at 3 -5. \n4 See, e.g., ALJ Report ¶¶ 123, 130, 136, 139-140, 155, 160, 165, 180, 213, 257, 269. \n5 See, e.g., id. at 25 ¶ 131, 40, 44, 45 ¶ 216, 47, 66, 67 fn. 547. \n6 See id . \n \n3 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n exercises independent judgement in its review of the entire evidentiary record,7 the Commission \nshould give significant weight to the ALJ’s factual findings and credibility determinations.8 \nPetitioners provide no valid reason to question the ALJ’s credibility determinations. \nPetitioners fail to meaningfully respond to the ALJ’s finding that “the Petitioner’s agreements \nand private discussions do not comport with their public statements ,”9 nor do they rebut the \nALJ’s conclusion that Petitioners’ misleading representations about last -minute changes to a key \nagreement setting out Petitioner commitments had “absolutely no credibility.”10 \nThe Petitioners complain that the ALJ Report included language similar to I ntervenors’ \nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.11 But there is nothing improper about this: the \nALJ asked all parties, including Petitioners, to file proposed findings of fact along with reply briefing in May.\n12 In light of the ALJ’s determination that I ntervenors’ evidence was more \ncredible than Petitioners’ evide nce, it is entirely appropriate that the ALJ Report would \nincorporate language from Intervenors’ proposed findings in the Report. This routine practice \ndoes nothing to change the fact that the ALJ Report is evenhanded and impartial.  \nMoreover, even if the ALJ had adopted Intervenors’ proposed findings in their entirety \nand without modification, which is not the case here, the published Minnesota cases cited by Petitioners confirm that a judge’s  adoption of one party’s proposed findings of fact and \n                         \n7 In the Matter of the Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minnesota, 624 \nN.W.2d 264, 278 (Minn. 2001) (when reviewing an ALJ report, agency decision- maker s should \n“weigh all of the evidence presented and come to an independent decision.”)  \n8 See Fahey v. Avnet, Inc., 525 N.W.2d 568, 571 (Minn. Ct. App. 1994); Hengemuhle v. Long \nPrairie  Jaycees , 358 N.W.2d 54, 59-60 (Minn. 1984). \n9 ALJ Report  at 66. \n10 Id. at 67 fn. 547. \n11 Petitioner Exceptions at 4 -5. \n12 Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, First Prehearing Order  at 3 (Oct. 28, 2024) ; Evidentiary Hearing \nTranscript Volume (Tr.

Petitioners’ proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law (provided as Attachment D to Petitioners’ exceptions) distort the record in this case by focusing exclusively on alleged benefits of the Acquisition  whil e ignoring or \nminimizing the abundant evidence of the transaction’s risks. The Commission should consider the entirety of the evidence in the record,  which is thoroughly and fairly presented in the ALJ \nReport, and exercise its own independent judgment based on that evidence.\n19 \nII. THE ALJ REPORT CORRECTLY APPLIED THE LEGAL STANDARD. \nPetitioners inaccurately claim that the ALJ Report applied an incorrect legal standard in \nthis case.20 Sierra Club and other Intervenors have explained that under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, \nthe standard for determining whether the Acquisition  is consistent with the public interest \nrequires a showing that the transaction would provide affirmative public benefits, not only that it would result in no net harm as Petitioners would have i t.\n21 But t he ALJ Report’s legal and factual \nconclusions are sound regardless of which legal standard applies. The ALJ Report included a detailed discussion of the parties’ dispute over the legal standard, including Petitioners’ and Intervenors’ positions and applicable caselaw.\n22 The ALJ Report finds that the “net benefit \nstandard” likely applies.23 Ultimately, however, the ALJ concludes that “resolution of the correct \nstandard is not necessary” because it does not determine the outcome: “[t]he proposed \n                         \n19 In the Matter of the Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minnesota, 624 \nN.W.2d at 278.  \n20 Petitioner Exceptions at 22.  \n21 See Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, Sierra Club’s Initial Post- Hearing Brief, Public – Redacted \nat 11−13 (May 1, 2025)  (hereinafter “Sierra Club Opening Br.”);  Docket No. E015/PA-24-198, \nSierra Club’s Reply Brief, Public – Redacted at 2−3 (May 29, 2025)  (hereinafter “Sier ra Club \nReply Br.”) .  \n22 ALJ Report at 63-65. \n23 Id. at 65. \n \n6 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n transaction does not pass muster under either standard because the Acquisition would result in \nnet harm to the public interest. ”24 In other words, even if the ALJ Report had applied Petitioners \nproposed “no net harm” standard rather than a “net benefit” standar d, the Acquisition  would still \nfail to satisfy that standard because the ALJ Report finds that it would result in net harm.  \nIII. THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE ALJ’ S FINDING THAT THE ACQUISITION \nIS NOT IN THE PUBLIC  INTEREST, WITH OR WITHOUT THE PROPOSED \nSETTLEMENT. \nThe evidence in this proceeding shows that the proposed Acquisition  has substantial risks \nand few benefits: it may threaten Minnesota Power’s compliance with the Carbon Free \nStandard,25 does not guarantee access to capital,26 is likely to contribute to higher rates ,27 and \nwould result in the Partners’ total control of the ALLETE Board28 and in reduced transparency .29 \nContrary to Petitioners’ claims, the ALJ Report’s factual and legal conclusions on these points are well -supported by the evidentiary record.  \nThe Proposed Settlement does nothing to change these conclusions , as most of its \ncommitments simply describe the status quo or restate existing legal requirements without offering any benefits . The few new commitments in the Proposed Settlement are far too limited \nto be meaningful: they do not mitigate the risks of the Acquisition  and do not provide any \nbenefits sufficient to outweigh the Acquisition ’s harms .\n30 \n                         \n24 Id.

The Acquisition  and Proposed Settlement Would Not Ensure a C lean Energy \nTransition or Compliance with the Carbon Free Standard. \nThe ALJ Report correctly found that Petitioners have not shown that the proposed \nAcquisition  is necessary or sufficient for the Company to comply with the Carbon Free \nStandard.31 Petitioner s’ attempts to challenge the ALJ Report’s conclusions do not hold water. \nPetitioners claim that the ALJ ignored evidence of the Partners’ supposed commitment to a clean \nenergy transition.32 But while Alloy Parent  commits to provide financing for the Company’s \nfive-year capital plan, the Partners  have not made an enforceable commitment to provide any \namount of capital specifically to fund renewable energy .33 And while Petitioners claim that the \nPartners  view complia nce with the Carbon Free Standard as a benefit,34 the Partners have \ndeclined to commit to achieve the Carbon Free Standard, instead promising only to make “efforts to achieve” the standard , an illusory statement which is not a meaningful commitment.\n35 \nMoreover, both CPP and Blackrock (owner of GIP) have recently abandoned previous \norganization-wide emissions reduction targets and clean energy  pledges , calling into question \nwhether the Partners  remain committed to decarbonization.36 \nPetitioners also mischaracterize the ALJ Report, wrongly claiming that the ALJ Report \ncalled for delaying compliance with the Carbon Free Standard or that the ALJ Report concluded \n                         \n31 ALJ Report at 66. \n32 Petitioner Exceptions at 37. \n33 ALJ Report at 66, 40 ¶ 187; Tr.

On the contrary, the ALJ Report acknowledged that compliance with the \nCarbon Free Standard is a critically important legal requirement.38 However, the ALJ Report \nfound that “[t] he Petitioners did  not prove by a preponderance of evidence that they will be \nunable to meet the Carbon  Free Standard absent the Acquisition , nor did they guarantee or \npresent sufficient  evidence showing that the standard will be met as a result of the \nAcquisition .”39 The ALJ Report finds that Petitioners failed to show the Acquisition  is needed to \nmeet the Carbon Free Standard or that the standard could not be met if the Company relied on capital from public markets. There is no credible evidence showing that rejecting the Acquisition  \nwould result in any delay in achieving the Carbon Free Standard.  \nPetitioners point to the “Clean Firm Technology Fund” included in the Proposed \nSettlement as a benefit of the Acquisition  and assert that the fund would help facilitate the \nCompany’s compliance with the Car bon Free Standard.\n40 Sierra Club agrees that firm  carbon -\nfree resources can help advance the Company’s clean energy transition.

Moreover, there is no guarantee that the proposed “Clean Firm Techn ology Fund” will \nbe used for fully carbon- free technologies.  The Proposed Settlement includes a provision that \nexpressly allows Minnesota Power to seek exemptions in order to use the fund for resources that \ndo not  meet the Company’s own definition of “clean firm technology” if DOC agrees.42 \nMoreover, Minnesota Power and DOC have recently argued in another Commission docket that the statutory definition of “carbon free” should be interpreted to treat carbon -emitting thermal \ngenerating technologies including solid waste, biomas s, and renewable natural gas as fully or \npartially carbon free.\n43 Given the Company’s position on this issue, there is a risk that Minnesota \nPower may seek to use the “Clean Firm Technology Fund” to finance development of carbon-emitting power plants that burn solid waste, biomass, or natural gas. If used in this way, the fund would impede the Company’s progress towards developing a legitimately carbon- free generating \nportfolio rather than helping to achieve the Carbon Free Standard. \nB. Petitioners Have Not Shown That the Acquisition  is Needed or That it Would \nImprove the Company’s Access to Capital . \nThe ALJ Report correctly found that Petitioners have failed to demonstrate (1) that the \nAcquisition  is necessary to obtain sufficient capital to comply with the Carbon Free Standard,\n44 \n                         \n41 Ex.

However, Petitioners have not shown that \nthe Company’s true capital need is as large as it claim s. The record shows that the Company has \nconsistently over- estimated its capital needs  since 2019.48 Moreover, Intervenor testimony and \nthe ALJ Report identified several ways that ALLETE could mitigate its future capital needs ,49 \nincluding via the expanded use of power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) ,50 demand response, \nenergy efficiency measures, and grid -enhancing technologies,51 or by selling its stake in joint \ntransmission projects  or non- utility subsidiaries.52 Petitioners did not present any concrete \nevidence showing that it would be infeasible to reduce the Company’s capital needs using more \nor more of these strategies.  \nMoreover, the ALJ Report correctly found that Petitioners have not shown that ALLETE  \nneeds the Acquisition  in order to meet its capital needs.53 Petitioners have not demonstrated that \n                         \n45 Id. at 27 ¶ 135; see also  id. at 25 ¶¶ 131−132.  \n46 Id. at 28−29 ¶ 141, 66, 67. \n47 Petitioner Exceptions at 46. \n48 ALJ Report at 24 ¶ 128; Ex.

Petitioners claim that relying \non public equity markets would be unreasonably risky and that doing so could raise financing \ncosts,54 but they do not provide any concrete evidence to support that claim, only conclusory \nassertion s. Petitioners  did not provide any quantitative analysis of the risks of equity issuances in \npublic markets.55 The record shows that Petitioners have historically had no difficulty raising \ncapital in public markets,56 and there is no evidence in the record showing that it would be \ninfeasible or unreasonably risky to rely on public markets in the future, even if ALLETE’s capital needs increase.  \nPetitioners argue that the primary goal of the Acquisition  is to provide access to capital. \nPetitioner s repeat the false claim that “the Partners have expressly committed to providing equity \ncapital to fund ALLETE’s five- year investment plan .”\n57 But the Proposed Settlement clearly \nstates that the commitment to finance ALLETE’s five -year cap ital plan is made by Alloy Parent , \nnot the Partners.58 Petitioners attempt to ignore this critical distinction. As the ALJ explained, \n“[a] commitment by Alloy Parent is not the same thing as a commitment by the Partners ” \nbecause “[t] here is no guarantee that the Partners will provide capital to Alloy Parent.”59 The \nPartners themselves have not actually committed to provide any capital to ALLETE, as the ALJ Report correctly recognizes.\n60 The Partners have made no commitments as to how long they will \n                         \n54 Petitioner Exceptions at 55, 57. \n55 See Tr.

The Acquisition  is Likely to Result in Overspending and Rate Increase s. \nMinnesota Power has expressly acknowledged that it plans to increase rates and provided \nprojections of those planned increases, which the Company has fought to keep confidenti al.65 \nPetitioners  argue that the Acquisition  will not contribute to those rate increases or that the \nmagnitude of future increases is speculative.66 But the Partners are pursuing the Acquisition  in \norder to maximize returns,67 and if the transaction is approved they will have an  incentive to \ndirect the Company to seek even larger rate increases.68 The Partners will likewise have an \nincentive to push the Company to prioritize capital spending in order to increase rate base, even \n                         \n61 Id. at 28; Ex.

Effective Commission oversight depends on utility cooperation and transparency, and the Acquisition  may make ALLETE less cooperative and less t ransparent.\n72 \nThe Proposed Settlement does not mitigate the risks of overspending and rate increases. \nPetitioners’  commitments in the Proposed Settlement to delay the next  rate case application by \none year until November 2026 or to temporarily decrease return on equity (“ROE”) by 0.13 \npercent until that rate case is filed does nothing to protect ratepayers from the likelihood that the Partners will direct the Company to seek large rate increases in future rate cases.\n73 And \nPetitioners’ commitment not to recover transaction costs of the Acquisition  from ratepayers is \nnot a n affirmative  benefit, as those costs would not be incurred absent the Acquisition .74 \nD. Partner Control of the ALLETE Board Poses Risks to Ratepayers. \nPetitioner s do not dispute the ALJ Report’s finding that the Acquisition  would likely \nresult in the Partners having “complete control” of the ALLETE Board of Directors.75 Indeed, \n                         \n69 Ex.

Petitioners simply point to the modifications to the Board governance structure contained in the Proposed Settlement, including the proposed addition of two more “independent” directors.\n76 But Petitioners’ proposal to \ninclude six “independent” directors on the Board does  not meaningfully limit the Partners’ \ncontrol of the Board: each of those six directors would be appointed by the Partners, and they make up less than half of the fourteen total Board members.\n77 And Petitioners’ promise that \nALLETE management will continue to oversee “day- to-day operations” is worth little when the \nPartners’ consent rig hts give them the power to control every significant decision made by the \nCompany.78 \nPetitioners argue that it would be “unrealistic” to limit the Partners’ control of the Company and suggest that the Partners’ interests would be fully aligned with ratepayer interests.\n79 On the \ncontrary, there is considerable risk that the Partners’ pursuit of higher returns would lead to higher rates for customers, as discussed in Section III.C. The Proposed Settlement does not mitigate the risks to ratepayers resulting from  the Partners’ domination of the ALLETE board. \nE. The Acquisition  Would Reduce Transparency . \nThe ALJ Report correctly found that the Acquisition  would reduce transparency because \nALLETE would no longer be required to provide the same reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and that the more limited financial disclosure commitments proposed by Petitioners would not fully make up for that loss of transparency.\n80 Petitioners \n                         \n76 Petitioner Exceptions at 40, 68.  \n77 Proposed Settlement at 5 ¶ 1.23(b). \n78 Petitioner Exceptions at 39 -40. \n79 Id. \n80 ALJ Report at 36 ¶¶ 173−174, 51 ¶¶ 243, 244.  \n \n15 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n attempt to dismiss the ALJ’s well- founded concerns , pointing to commitm ents in the Proposed \nSettlement that the Company and Alloy Parent would provide the Commission with access to \nbooks, records, and financial statements .81 However, these commitments have a critical flaw: \nthey do not require the Partners to make any financial disclosures to the Commission, because they apply only to entities up to Alloy Parent, not to CPP or GIP.\n82 Petitioners inaccurately claim \nthat “[n] either the Opposing Parties nor the Report identified any information that the \nCommission would need that the Petitioners have not already committed to provide .”83 On the \ncontrary, the ALJ Report correctly found that Petitioners have not committed to provide any financial disclosures about the Partners,  even if related to ALLETE’s regulated operations.\n84 \nSierra Club and other parties explained that the Commission needs this information in order to understand how the Partners’ financial situation impacts ALLETE and to carry out its regulatory responsibility to protect ratepayers.\n85  \nCONCLUSION \nThe ALJ Report correctly finds that the proposed Acquisition  is not consistent with the \npublic interest. The Proposed Settlement does not adequately mitigate the Acquisition ’s risks and \ndoes not provide any benefits sufficient to outweigh its likely harms. T he Commissio n should \nadopt the ALJ Report, reject the Proposed Settlement and disapprove the Acquisition . \n  \n                         \n81 Petitioner Exceptions at 45. \n82 See Proposed Settlement at 7 ¶ 1.33, 8 ¶ 1.38. \n83 Petitioner Exceptions at 45. \n84 ALJ Report at 36−37 ¶ 174. \n85 Sierra Club Opening Br. at 36; Sierra Club Reply Br. at 20; Ex.

The \nDepartment’s separate finding on misappropriated money for past and future land sales should be \nrewritten and adopted , along with a denial of the application.  \n7 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations at 67 n.549 (July 15, 2025), \neDocket Document No. 20257 -221020 -01 [hereinafter “ALJ Report”] (concluding: “the \nAdministrative Law Judge has reviewed the stipulation and notes that her concerns rega rding \nthe Acquisition have not been resolved and it does not change the Administrative Law Judge’s \nrecommendation to disapprove the Acquisition.”).  \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n3 argument of  non-credible witnesses. The ALJ Report clearly did encompass the full record and \nfound that the Applicants had failed to make the necessary showings to meet the applicable legal \nstandard.  \n \nAs a result, the Commission should be confident in taking action to deny this acquisition, knowing  \nthat: t he Applicants have not  carried their burden to prove this acquisition is “consistent with the \npublic interest;”  have not demonstrated  the need for the  Partners’  involvement  in the \nmanagement of Minnesota Power;  have not committed  any Partner funds  to any carbon -free \ntransition  of Minnesota Power energy resources ; have not committed to an earlier  retirement of \nBoswell ; and have announced  (in the Minnesot a Power 2025 -2039 IRP docket)  plans to add a \ngigawatt  or more  of new and replacement  gas generation —which appears to include both  the \nconstruction of  NTEC and the re -fueling of Boswell instead of replace ment  with carbon -free \nenergy  sources .8  \n \nThe ALJ did not find the Applicants’  experts convincing, so the fact that they were not given equal \ntime in the ALJ Report is a normal consequence of brining either irrelevant or non-credible  \ntestimony .9  \n \nb. Public comments  \n \nThe Applicants take umbrage at the ALJ’s description of many of the public comments in favor of \nthe acquisition  aligning with financial support from Minnesota Power , stating: “This speculation \ndismisses the opinion of dozens of commenters without any basis for doing so. . . . It is \ninappropriate and insulting to suggest commenters in support of the Acquisition are driven by a \nfinancial interest, particularly without identifying  any factual basis for such a suggestion.”10 \nHowever, independent analysis of thes e same public comments has shown that the ALJ’s findings \nwere correct and that the large majority of comments in favor of the acquisition were tied to \nfinancial attachments to Minnesota Power or its charitable giving.  \n \n \n8 Further, the Commission should be confident in their decision as t he ALJ found that the \nApplicants over -applied  trade secret designations and said different things to the public than \nthey say  secretly among themselves.  \n9 The fact that Minnesota Power’s experts do not seem to understand the deal they have struck \nwith the Partners is a telling example of this issue. ALJ Report at ⁋ 263 (“The record reflects that \nALLETE does not understand key gov ernance terms discussed in the term sheet. [NOT PUBLIC \nHCTS DATA REDACTED]  This demonstrated lack of understanding suggests that ALLETE does \nnot fully appreciate how much control the Partners will have over its post -transaction affairs.”). If \ntestimony from one of the experts is shown to not be based on what is actually true in this case, it \nwould be normal for the Commission to make their ultimate decision without strongly weighing \nthat incorrect testimony.  \n10 Applicants Exceptions at 18.  \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n4 An independent analysis of all comments summarized by the ALJ found that o f the almost 500 \npublic comments offered on the acquisition , “The vast majority opposed the transaction. Roughly \n81 supported (or did not explicitly oppose) the deal, according to an Energy and Policy Institute \nreview. At least 72 of those were from individuals and organizations that appear to have ties – \noften fin ancial – to Minnesota Power or Allete, according to publicly available information.”11 That \nis to say, less than ten  comments in support of the acquisition  from the public were not \nimmediately attributable to a financial stake in Minnesota Power, or a similar affiliation or \nassociation.12 \n \nThese are verified facts, not insults. The “deep disrespect” that the Applicants complain of,13 is \napparent in their exceptions to the ALJ Report, but the disrespect shown is squarely theirs and not \nfound among the ALJ’s sound findings . \n \nc. UPPCO  \n \nThe Applicants are clearly upset that the ALJ found other witnesses more credible than their \nwitness regarding the Michigan utility that has been wrecked by multiple private equity owners.14 \nThe Applicants’ expert attempted to argue that the UPPCO debacle was not his fault, even though \nits sale was approved under his supervision as a regulator. Regardless of conflicted testimony \noffered, the UPPCO example and considerable evidence about it sup plied by witnesses for CURE  \nand the Citizens Utility Board supported the opposite conclusions to what the Applicants choose \nto believe.15  The record shows that UPPCO , now held by a second private equity buyer,  is a severe \nfinancial burden  for the people of Michigan , demonstrating a potential future for Minnesota \nPower under similar ownership.  \n \nd. LiUNA’s witness  \n \nThe Applicants also malign the failure to credit a witness who  directly profits from the Partners’ \ninvestment funds.16 Similar to their anger at the treatment of public comments that align with \nfinancial support, the Applicants would like to see this process credit witness testimony that \n \n11 Karlee Weinmann, ‘Financial support’ from Minnesota Power may have influenced backers of \nutility acquisition, judge says , Energy & Policy Institute, July 24, 2025,   \nhttps://energyandpolicy.org/financial -support -influenced -allete -blackrock -comments/  \n12 Id.

The Partners ’ control over other party filings  \n \nConsidering the Applicants’  stated disgust at the insinuation that public comments in support of \ntheir acquisition may have been influenced by financial support, it is notable that one of the \nAugust 4 filings in this case appear s to indicate that an attorney representing the Partners has \nengaged in rewriting the official comments of another party to this case.  \n \nOn August 4, the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters/IUOE Local 49  filed \ncomments in support of the acquisition, with official service of parties at 3:26 PM.17 However , that \nfiling, which also explicitly endorsed the ALJ’s Report and findings, was corrected in another copy \nof the comment which was officially served at 4:40 PM that day.18 The updated version of the \ndocument no longer endorsed the ALJ Report and appears to be an edited version of the original \ndocument.  \n \nThe metadata for the corrected version of the party filing suggests that it was created by one of \nthe attorneys representing the Partners in this matter at 4:38:24 PM on August 4:  \n \n \nFig 1.

It also illustrates that the ALJ’s findings were in no way excessive in suggesting \nthat these companies may make efforts to change the record to suit them ; they clearly have done \nso when it was  deemed  important by the Partners ’ representatives.  \n \n2. The Department  \n \nCURE’s initial comment  discusses the Department’s proposed “settlement” with the Applicants \nand how it does not remedy the fact that this acquisition is contrary to the public interest . CURE \nbelieves that the Department’s own briefing and expert testimony , produced by Department staff \nand legal representatives prior to the stipulation,  proves without any doubt that this acquisition \nis too risky and harmful to the people of Minnesota to be consistent with the public interest, even \nwith the addition of  condit ions proffered by the Department in July 11th filings.  \n \nThe Department incorrectly states that “The report, however, did not expressly address the new \ncommitments memorialized in the stipulation.”19 The ALJ Report explicitly did do so , finding that \nthe stipulation did not change the ALJ’s analysis or conclusions .20  \n \na. Misappropriated land profits  \n \nCURE fully agree s with the Department that Minnesota Power’s  withholding of 75.4 million dollars \nsince 2021 is unacceptable and robs customers of the accrued interest they would have received \nbut for this misappropriation.21 To the extent that this is true, Minnesota Power  should be \npenalized by the Commission  for misappropriating ratepayer funds  and should disgorge all land \nprofits immediately  (and all future land profits as they are realized) . Also, as discussed by CURE \nin its initial comment, this misplaced money could  be used to provide a larger benefit to \nMinnesota Power  ratepayers than all of the commitments offered by the Applicants  in this \nproceeding . This 75.4-million -dollar “benefit ,” which the Department again touted in its initial \ncomment,22 is totally separate from this acquisition and should be ordered  by the Commission  \nregardless of this proceeding or the stipulation .  \n \nIn denying the petition of the Applicants, t he Commission should reject all other proposed \nfindings  offered by the Applicants and Department,  and rewrite 222a23 to require MP immediately \ncommit this ill -got money to directly benefit ratepayers through low -income programs and \nrenewable energy investment.  \n \n19 Department Comment a t 2. \n20 ALJ Report at 67 n.549.  \n21 Department Comment a t 8. \n22 Id. at 8. \n23 Importantly for Commission action, t he Department’s proposed finding 222a, contains a \n900,000 -dollar  typo: it says the money owed is “$74.5 ” million instead of “$75.4 ” million.  See id.  at \n9.  \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n7  \nb. ROE is too high , and rates will increase too soon  \n \nThe ROE and rate case stay -out provisions are exceptionally temporary. As the Department \nadmits, “assuming a November 2026 rate case filing, customers would likely benefit from the ROE \nreduction until late 2027 or early 2028.”24 The Department offers no evidence or explanation about \nwhy northeastern Minnesota’s ratepayers will be so well off in 2028 that they will be able to absorb \nthe large rate shock that will undoubtedly occur due to interim and final rate increases because of \nthe Partners’ first  rate case. Since the Unites States appears poised to be heading towards a trade -\nwar-induced recession at the same time that the federal government has significantly cut back on \nsafety net  programs, the opposite is much more likely to occur. By 2028, Minnesota’s rural utility \ncustomers will likely have less disposable income, less affordable healthcare, less access to \ngovernment assistance, less job prospects, and—should this acquisition be approved now —much \nhigher utility rates.  \n \nRather than a 0.13 percent adjustment, CURE encourages the Commission to actually address the \nfull harm of the high ROE and set Minnesota Power’s at a more reasonable standard: 6 percent.  \nThis can be done outside of this proceeding in a rate case . A lower ROE  is supported by CURE’s \ntestimony in this case, and would go a long way in protecting rural ratepayers from future gold -\nplating of Minnesota Power resources in order to inflate unearned profit margins. CURE also \nbelieves that a one -year rate case stay -out,25  is not sufficient to mitigate the plans  of these private \nequity companies —only a rate case stay -out for the entire time  that Minnesota Power is owned by \nprivate equity firms (these Partners or any they may sell to in the future) can protect Minnesotans \nfrom foreseeable harm.   \n \nc. “Clean firm” investment is not clean , and not sufficient  \n \nThe Department again makes much of the “clean firm” investment found in its July 11th \nstipulation.26 Unfortunately, there is nothing “clean” about this commitment, and it’s unlikely that \na mere 50 million dollar commitment (should the money ever be provided) would sufficiently play \nfor the gold -plated “carbon free” resources that Minnesota Power likely w ill attempt to pay for \nwith this fund.  \n \nIn Commission Docket 24 -352, both the Department and Minnesota Power have endorsed the \nburning of biomass as a “carbon -free” energy source that should continue beyond 2040 despite \n \n24 Department Comment a t 8. \n25 Department Comment at 8.  \n26 Settlement Stipulation of DOC, ALLETE, GIP, CPPIB, at 12, July 11, 2025, eDocket Document \nNo. 20257 -220879 -01 (commitment 1.63).  \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n8 Minnesota’s 100 percent carbon -free electricity by 2040 standard (carbon -free standard or CFS).27 \nPrivate equity  is also heavily invested in carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects, \nsomething that the American Petroleum Institute and others have endorsed in that docket. Based \non the agreement between the Department and Minnesota Power, there is nothing stopping these \ntwo parties from agreeing between themselves to invest thi s entire “clean firm” fund in biomass, \ncarbon  capture and sequestration, or the logical marriage of the two —which will not reduce \ncarbon emissions at all but will cost ratepayers and the e nvironment dearly.  \n \nHence, this agreement, coupled with Minnesota Power’s proposed IRP, likely will waste this \n“clean” fund to emit far more carbon than the utility  would  have  by continuing coal operations at \nBoswell. Moreover, by spending this seed money and ratepayer funds on biomass, this investment \nwill harm forest  resources  managed by the Leech Lake  Band of Ojib we in close proximity to \nBoswell’s new need for burnable fuel . Both by burning the woody biomass and by converting \ndiverse forests to clear cuts, this “clean firm” fund will increase environmental harm and \ngreenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n3. Laborers International Union of North America Minnesota & North Dakota  \n \nLiUNA is concerned that its expert was not credited as an expert ,28 ignoring the fact that her \ntestimony was unresponsive to all of the questions posed by the Commission to the parties and \nthe ALJ . As a pleased  private equity customer, this witness  provided no expertise germane to the \nquestions posed by the Commission.  \n \nThe expertise  outlined in the LiUNA’s witness’s  original testimony derives from experience as an  \nexecutive  employee at LiUNA and experience within LiUNA’s 65 billion  dollars  in affiliated \npension funds. While this is anecdotal evidence, it is not even necessarily representative of other \nGIP customers,  as LiUNA is a relatively small  limited partner compared to retirement funds \nnationally which easily top 100 billion  dollars  in assets each.29  \n \nWhile witness Bryant  has considerable expertise in investing  pension funds , she offered no \ninformation about private equity’s impacts on labor unions or skilled employment, customer bills, \nthe environment, or other issues relevant to the public interest of Minnesota . As a result, the ALJ \nhad no reason to rely on this expert —she testified to her  viewpoint that more money is better than \n \n27 PFPI, CURE , MNIPL Comment , In the Matter of an Investigation into Implementing Changes to \nthe Renewable  Energy Standard and the Newly Created Carbon Free Standard under Minn.

The experience of one of GIP’s limited \npartner investors does not rise to the level of relevant evidence.30 \n \n4. Energy CENTS  Coalition  \n  \nCURE appreciates ECC’s clear statement that their representation of low - and fixed -income \ncustomers should not be construed as sufficient ratepayer protections to mitigate the harm caused \nto customers.31 ECC explains: “ We never presumed that  our nego tiations with the  Company and \nthe Partners would be the only concessions  for ratepayers broadly in this mat ter. We are of course \ndeeply concerned with the  well-being of all ratepayers, regardless of whether they are income \nqualified. ”32 \n \nCURE strongly supports the low -income programs that ECC champions, and agrees that they \nshould be adequately funded going forward to meet the needs of Northeastern Minnesotans. \nHowever, a comparatively small lump sum committed towards the utility’s existin g program will \nnot be sufficient if this acquisition goes through , because it will drive large numbers of customers \ninto poverty, increasing the need for more funding for such programs as ECC administers .  \n \nAs stated in initial comments, CURE continues to believe that t he rate increases that are caused \nby this proposed acquisition will hit low -income and marginalized communities the hardest, both \nthrough rate impacts and by causing economic difficulty for businesses that supply industrial \nemployment.33 As the ALJ found : “The Partners’ private memoranda, modeling, and \ncommunications with potential investors establish that the Partners are planning on significant \nrate increases that will likely exceed the long -run rate of inflation. . . . The Acquisition creates an \nunacceptable risk of rate increase and rate shock in a critical and economically vulnerable area of \nMinnesota.”34 \n \n5. Non -party organization  comments  \n \nAs already discussed, nearly all public comments offered in favor of this acquisition appear to be \nfrom parties who are financially connected to Minnesota Power or ALLETE. Any additional  \n \n30 Additionally, LiUNA again attempts to make a bizarre argument that it previously offered in \nbriefing about the use of the word “heterogeneous” in one source cited by a CURE witness. LiUNA \nInitial Comment and Exceptions at 10. CURE addressed this argument in reply briefing and will \nnot waste the Commission’s time with further discussion, other than to note that it is not true and \nthe ALJ correctly already considered and rejected this argument.  \n31 ECC Comments at 3 \n32 Id.  \n33 ALJ Report  ⁋ 220 (“These projected rate increases will likely exceed the inflation rate, adversely \nimpacting the budgets of residential customers and the economic competitiveness of ALLETE’s \nlarge industrial customers.”).  \n34 Id. ⁋ 222. \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n10 supportive comments at this point appear to be made in  ignorance of the record before the \nCommission , which clearly demonstrates foreseen harms to workers, the environment, customers \nof all sizes, industrial output and profitability, transparency, accountability, and Minnesota \nPower’s long -term reliability and maintenance .  \n \nMembers of the public generally do not make technical comments applying legal standards or \nadvocating for an outcome on policy grounds, but several organizations filed comments in support \nof this acquisition, purporting to make policy  arguments without  actually having reviewed the \ncomplete recor d, including the large amount of trade secret materials that generally contradict \npublic statements in favor of the acquisition . \n \nThese comments are of no substance. They do not reflect the record, they do not reflect the \nApplicants’ past or current business practices, they do not reflect commitments made  nor whether \nthese are enforceable by the Commission .  \n \nThese comments should be given little  weight as they are not based on the facts nor the law \napplicable in this case. They incorrectly assume that the agreement between the Department and \nthe Applicants places  financial  duties upon the Partners, while the July 11 stipulation  clearly does \nnot require that the Partners provide any funding at all. They incorrectly assume that the \nagreement supports replacing Boswell with “clean energy,”35 which Minnesota Power and the \nother Applicants clearly do not propose  to do —the IRP  expressly plans to replace all of Boswell’s \ngeneration with fossil gas and/or biomass energy  (an energy so urce more carbon intensive than \ncoal) .  \n \nThese commenters can be forgiven for not knowing anything about this docket, they never \nparticipated in it before August 4th. None of them sought party status or offered public comment \nduring the applicable comment period.  Their disinterest in this docket and the impacted northern \nMinnesota communities —for a full year of proceedings —echoes silently through the record.  \n \nThese comments also show no concern for negative impacts that have been proven by intervenors \nin testimony and briefing . They ignore the issues of affordability, the Commission’s central duty \nto all Minnesota ratepayers. As such, they are not useful to the Commission as it makes its decision \non this robust and complex record.  \n \nIt remains true, as the ALJ clearly found:  \n \nAt the heart of this matter is the amount of capital Minnesota Power will require,  \nand at what times, to comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard. The \n \n35 Fresh Energy  & Clean Grid Alli ance  at 2 (“And certainly, replacing Minnesota Power’s coal with \nclean energy is the basis for its  ability to meet Minnesota’s 100% clean electricity standard and \neconomy -wide greenhouse gas  reduction goals.”) . Unfortunately for these commenters, wishing \ndoesn’t make it true .  \n \n \n \nCUREmn .org    320 -269 -2984  \n117 South First Street • Montevideo, MN  56265  \n \n11 Petitioners did  not prove by a preponderance of evidence that they will be unable \nto meet the Carbon  Free Standard absent the Acquisition, nor did they guarantee or \npresent sufficient  evidence showing that the standard will be met as a result of the \nAcquisition. Furthermore,  the Legislature did not demand utilities, or the \nCommission, pursue the Carbon Free  Standard at all costs. The Commission is \ntasked with ensuring Minnesota Power’s path  to compliance “maximizes net \nbenefits to all Minnesota citizens.” U ltimately, even if  declining to approve the \nAcquisition eventually resulted in some complication or short  delay in Minnesota \nPower meeting the Carbon Free Standard, this is not a reason to  approve the \ntransaction given its serious risk to Minnesota ratepayers.36 \n \nConclusion  \n \nFor the foregoing reasons the Commission should deny the petition , and require Minnesota Power \nto commit its past and future land profits to actual renewable energy development and low -\nincome customer programs.  \n \nResp ectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ Hudson Kingston     \nHudson B.

This acquisition is not consistent with the public interest.\nThe recent “settlement agreement” reached between the Department of Commerce and Minnesota Power and their\nprivate equity backers does very little to address the deep risks this potential deal poses to Minnesota Powercustomers, employees, and the Minnesota public at large. Putting a handful of weak conditions on a fundamentallydangerous bargain does not make it “in the public interest.”\nThe companies pushing this deal utterly failed to make their case—there is no proof that this funding is needed, nor\nthat new owners will support the clean energy transition we need. There is no basis upon which to approve this deal,\nand a long record of harms and risks supporting denial.\nI expect Commissioners to listen to the majority of voices in this proceeding, including the Administrative Law\nJudge, who recognize this deal for what it is: a perilous gamble that hands Minnesota’s energy future over torapacious private equity interests at the expense of customers, workers, and local business and industry.\nDo your duty under Minnesota law to look out for the best interests of Minnesota Power customers, Minnesotans\nacross the state, and the public as a whole, and reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by the CanadaPension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.

Putting a handful of weak conditions on a fundamentallydangerous bargain does not make it “in the public interest.”\nThe companies pushing this deal utterly failed to make their case—there is no proof that this funding is needed, nor\nthat new owners will support the clean energy transition we need. There is no basis upon which to approve this deal,\nand a long record of harms and risks supporting denial.\nI expect Commissioners to listen to the majority of voices in this proceeding, including the Administrative Law\nJudge, who recognize this deal for what it is: a perilous gamble that hands Minnesota’s energy future over torapacious private equity interests at the expense of customers, workers, and local business and industry.\nDo your duty under Minnesota law to look out for the best interests of Minnesota Power customers, Minnesotans\nacross the state, and the public as a whole, and reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by the CanadaPension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.

As part of those efforts, AEOA has worked \nwith Minnesota Power on affordability outreach and connecting people to resources to \nassist with energy costs and energy conservation. Specifically, AEOA is a service provider \nfor energy assistance and weatherization services in Cook, Lake, and St. Louis \ncounties.   This includes the City of Duluth, the largest city in Minnesota Power’s servi ce \nterritory.   We have worked closely with Minnesota Power for many years to bring energy \nefficiency measures to customer homes, lower utility bills, and provide energy assistance \ndollars as well as affordability program referrals.  \n  \nThese brief comments are regarding the financial contribution by the Partners described in \nthe proposed settlement agreement under 1.48 “to significantly reduce residential arrears \nto pre -COVID -19 balances or lower, an outcome that would benefit all Minnes ota Power \ncustomers while providing account balance relief to the most economically challenged \nresidential customers.”  \n  \nGiven the recent uncertainty about Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n(LIHEAP) funding and the considerable need in the areas we serve, many of which include \nMinnesota Power’s customers, we submit this brief letter of support for that part of the \nsettlement agreement. We believe additional resources like those described would help to \nbring down balances owed on accounts and give customers some much-needed relief in \nan otherwise rising costs environment. AEOA would be very interested in updates on that \nproposal and would be a willing collaborator on design considerations and outreach.  \n \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \nScott Zahorik  \nExecutive Director  \n \n \n \n\nFrom: reinsong@everyactioncustom.com  on behalf of Elizabeth Songalia\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: Reject the ALLETE/MN Power acquisition by CPPIB & GIP (BlackRock) / PUC Docket Number 24-198\nDate: Monday, August 11, 2025 9:18:52 AM\n[You don't often get email from reinsong@everyactioncustom.com.

Putting a handful of weak conditions on a fundamentallydangerous bargain does not make it “in the public interest.”\nThe companies pushing this deal utterly failed to make their case—there is no proof that this funding is needed, nor\nthat new owners will support the clean energy transition we need.
