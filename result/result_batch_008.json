This acquisition is not consistent with the public interest.   Public equity seeks only to make a profit inthe few years they own a company or utility, while gutting the services provided. They actively benefit by stealingfrom customers and damaging a company. They are vultures that only exist to provide a quick profit to the seller andmine wealth from average people.  I have seen this as a physician watching private equity take over hospitals andphysician groups.\nThe recent “settlement agreement” reached between the Department of Commerce and Minnesota Power and their\nprivate equity backers does very little to address the deep risks this potential deal poses to Minnesota Power\ncustomers, employees, and the Minnesota public at large.

This acquisition is not consistent with the public interest.\nThe recent “settlement agreement” reached between the Department of Commerce and Minnesota Power and their\nprivate equity backers does very little to address the deep risks this potential deal poses to Minnesota Powercustomers, employees, and the Minnesota public at large. Putting a handful of weak conditions on a fundamentallydangerous bargain does not make it “in the public interest.”\nThe companies pushing this deal utterly failed to make their case—there is no proof that this funding is needed, nor\nthat new owners will support the clean energy transition we need. There is no basis upon which to approve this deal,\nand a long record of harms and risks supporting denial.\nI expect Commissioners to listen to the majority of voices in this proceeding, including the Administrative Law\nJudge, who recognize this deal for what it is: a perilous gamble that hands Minnesota’s energy future over torapacious private equity interests at the expense of customers, workers, and local business and industry.\nDo your duty under Minnesota law to look out for the best interests of Minnesota Power customers, Minnesotans\nacross the state, and the public as a whole, and reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by the CanadaPension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.

If approved, it would likely result in significantly increased electric ratesand less reliable service for customers who are already struggling to pay electric bills and have no choice in their\nelectricity provider. That is because we can expect the new owners will cut corners to generate high shareholder\nreturns to recoup the premium costs of their investment. While I was not clear on what this was at first, I now seethe acquisition would cause the utility to lose access to capital from public markets, making it solely reliant on thesetwo investors for its financial needs.\nBoth the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and Brian Edstrom with the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, who\nadvocate for consumers when litigating utility purchases, have both published blog posts sharing significantconcerns about this acquisition.\nThe recent “settlement agreement” reached between the Department of Commerce and Minnesota Power and their\nprivate equity backers does very little to address the deep risks this potential deal poses to Minnesota Powercustomers, employees, and the Minnesota public at large. Putting a handful of weak conditions on a fundamentally\ndangerous bargain does not make it “in the public interest.”\nThe companies pushing this deal utterly failed to make their case—there is no proof that this funding is needed, nor\nthat new owners will support the clean energy transition we need. There is no basis upon which to approve this deal,and a long record of harms and risks supporting denial.\nI expect Commissioners to listen to the majority of voices in this proceeding, including the Administrative Law\nJudge, who recognize this deal for what it is: a perilous gamble that hands Minnesota’s energy future over torapacious private equity interests at the expense of customers, workers, and local business and industry.\nDo your duty under Minnesota law to look out for the best interests of Minnesota Power customers, Minnesotans\nacross the state, and the public as a whole, and reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by the CanadaPension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.

E-015/PA-24-198\nLeave a comment on the docket. *\nDear Commissioners,\nI am a Minnesota Power customer in Fall Lake Township and also live directly upriver from one of\nMinnesota Power’s hydropower facilities. It is as a directly impacted resident of northern Minnesotathat I urge you to reject the proposed acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by GlobalInfrastructure Partners (a division of BlackRock) and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board. Ialso ask you to deem the “settlement” between the applicants and Department of Commerce asinsufficient to protect residential ratepayers like me, other Minnesota Power customers, and thegeneral public interest.\nMany other parties to this case who have deep knowledge of both the public and non-public\nevidence about this deal have provided detailed arguments and support for the Administrative LawJudge’s finding that this acquisition would be a bad deal for Minnesota Power customers and thepublic at large and I will not repeat those here. But given the unequivocal findings of the ALJ thatthis deal is not in the public interest, the public will take note if the Commission decides to set asidethe facts and approve it. I hold out hope that is not what the Commission decides.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to respond to the collection of so-called “clean energy\nadvocates” who have decided to offer their support for this deal after showing no interest orknowledge about the issue for the past year. Setting aside the fact that their comments in both thedocket and in public communications show a deep ignorance about both the facts of this deal andprivate infrastructure markets more generally, what is most disheartening is to see just how readilythis constituency is willing to throw ratepayers and regular working people under the bus for somedistorted version of an energy transition. This is disturbing on principle and directly undermines anyclaims they make about their commitment to equity and justice. \nThis class of proponents seems wholly unconcerned with the ALJ’s fact-based conclusion that “The\nAcquisition creates an unacceptable risk of rate increase and rate shock in a critical andeconomically vulnerable area of Minnesota.” A one-year rate freeze as offered by the Department's\"settlement\" would be laughable in how minimal a protection that is, but only if you’re not aMinnesota Power customer. In that case it is not funny at all. In one year, the return on equity will\nstill be an inflated >9% if not higher at the end of a rate case, a price that will be extracted from\nratepayers who have no choice but to pay the utility bill they get in the mail. Because that of course\nis what the Partners are actually looking to buy, control, and exploit with this deal—the captive\ncustomer base.\nThese “clean energy advocates” and other deal supporters also seem to deeply underestimate the\npolitical consequences of their actions with dangerous implications. As the country continues tomarch down the road towards fascism built in large part on the real and perceived grievances ofregular, working people that are just barely keeping their heads above water—or are alreadydrowning—the boosters of clean-energy-at-all-costs are helping to pave that road. I hope that theCommission does not join them.\nMaggie Schuppert\nFall Lake TownshipEly, MN 55731\nFrom: nancydennis22@everyactioncustom.com  on behalf of Nancy Dennis\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: Reject the ALLETE/MN Power acquisition by CPPIB & GIP (BlackRock) / PUC Docket Number 24-198\nDate: Thursday, August 14, 2025 12:56:55 PM\n[You don't often get email from nancydennis22@everyactioncustom.com.

As we stated in our original comment, our organization provided expert testimony in this case on behalf of the intervenor CURE, opposing the private equity acquisition of ALLETE and its subsidiary Minnesota Power. Our organization has reviewed the proposed settlement between the Department of Commerce and ALLETE as well as the comments and exceptions filed by parties of the settlement and found that the proposal does not adequately resolve the concerns we raised about the private equity buyout of Minnesota Power by GIP and BlackRock. It also leaves room for financial engineering tactics outlined in the recently released ALJ Findings of Facts - “If the Partners employ financial engineering strategies to increase the returns they earn from their investments in Alloy, the likely result is extra debt that causes ALLETE’s cost of capital to rise, which would result in rates that are higher than they otherwise would have been absent the proposed acquisition.”1 Therefore, we do not find the settlement consistent with the public interest within the meaning of Minn. Stat. § 216B.50. In particular, we would like to address claims raised in the Exceptions of Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Global Infrastructure Partners (Exception), which can be seen below.  The Upper Peninsula Power Company Transaction The Exception outlines how Witness Quackenbush’s testimony should have been more heavily cited regarding the Administrative Law Judge’s (ALJ) findings about the Upper Peninsula Power Company (UPPCO). There are many factors and evidence that exist outside of Witness Quackenbush’s experience as the head of the Michigan Public Service Commission while UPPCO was seeking approval for private equity acquisitions.  As stated by the ALJ: “Given the similarities between ALLETE and UPPCO, the Administrative Law Judge finds that the private-equity model offered by the Partners is not in the public interest.\" Multiple local news reports described exorbitant rates and unaffordable bills to ratepayers in the wake of UPPCO being taken over by private equity.2,3 During a rate case four years after private equity ownership of UPPCO, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed testimony in the case saying, “UPPCO’s case to increase rates by nearly $10 million is simply  1  State of Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings, “Findings Of Fact, Conclusions Of Law, And Recommendations”, Accessed July 29, 2025, https://www.edockets.state.mn.us/documents/%7B70F30F98-0000-CF5C-BB62-491162C889B0%7D/download?contentSequence=0&rowIndex=24  2 “Detroit Free Press Subscription Offers, Specials, and Discounts.” Freep.com, 2025, www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/09/07/power-outrage-electric-bills-upper-peninsula/89593302/ .

Accessed 11 Aug. 2025. \n      \n  2  unsupportable”.4 Witness Quackenbush’s Surrebutal testimony stating that UPPCO continued to provide “reliable and affordable service” simply does not hold up against this other evidence cited by the ALJ.5  Stereotypes about “Private Equity” Investors The Exception claims “the Partners are mostly made up of pension funds” and later that “sixty percent of ALLETE will be owned by pension funds making investments on behalf of public employees in California and Canadian workers and beneficiaries, which are categorically not private equity investors.”6 This statement is false. Direct pension fund investments are often made through private equity firms, with the pension acting as a limited partner and the private equity firm acting as the general partner. The general partner is in control of the specific investments once a pension fund has made the commitment. In this case, BlackRock’s GIP is the firm in question and the Petition clearly delineates the proposed ownership structure of ALLETE as 60% control through 2 GIP funds and 40% by CPP Investments.  The Exception says the report has mischaracterized who the Partners are because the ALJ report describes GIP’s investments in oil and gas and not the “over $15 billion invested in or committed to renewable energy development.” While encouraging that more private equity infrastructure investors are taking opportunities of financial gains in the renewable energy sector, $15 billion represents only 8.8% of GIP’s $170B AUM.7  PESP retains its position that the Settlement does not resolve concerns about the acquisition of Minnesota Power by GIP, BlackRock, and CPPIB The stipulations outlined in this settlement regarding rates of return, debt, and rate increases are weak. As the judge's recommendation notes that: “The nonpublic evidence reveals the partners’ intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control,” Judge McKenzie wrote. “The partners themselves have carefully committed to do very little.”  There is still a threat that Minnesota Power’s captive customer base would bear the financial burden of fulfilling private equity’s promises to its investors regarding above-market returns.    4 “AG Nessel Steps in to Protect up Customers from Exorbitant Electric Rate Increases.” Michigan.gov, 2021, www.michigan.gov/en/ag/News/press-releases/2019/02/26/AG-Nessel-Steps-in-to-Protect-UP-Customers-from-Exorbitant-Electric-Rate-Increases .

There is no basis upon which to approve this deal,\nand a long record of harms and risks supporting denial.\nI expect Commissioners to listen to the majority of voices in this proceeding, including the Administrative Law\nJudge, who recognize this deal for what it is: a perilous gamble that hands Minnesota’s energy future over torapacious private equity interests at the expense of customers, workers, and local business and industry.\nDo your duty under Minnesota law to look out for the best interests of Minnesota Power customers, Minnesotans\nacross the state, and the public as a whole, and reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by the CanadaPension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.

Local officials aren’t saying what it is.\nhttps://www.startribune.com/a-massive-development-is-coming-to-a-northeast-minnesota-city-local-officials-arent-saying-what-it-is/601347560 1/6\nmake comments.”\n“We want to be cognizant of their privacy when they’re exploring opportunities,” he said.\nThe proposal has triggered both environmental-review and neighborhood concern in the city that borders Duluth to the west.\nHermantown recently asked for an Alternative Urban Areawide Review, which will examine how a development scenario would aﬀect\nthe environment. A limited liability company, Harmony Group, is listed as the proposer. An attorney associated with the company did\nnot return a message.\nHermantown economic development director Chad Ronchetti said two city staﬀ members had signed the agreement. But the city\noperates with the same level of privacy and conﬁdentiality with all developers evaluating projects there, regardless of whether an NDA is\nsigned, he said.\n“I think that having an NDA provided the developer with a level of comfort” to determine whether its project will be successful,\nRonchetti said.\nThe 400-acre study area is in Hermantown’s southwestern corner, on rural forested land that holds a Minnesota Power substation and\nsome homes. The “light industrial” development to be evaluated would include multiple buildings on 210 acres in the eastern portion of\nthe area. The document says tree clearing could begin later this year.\nHermantown leaders recently changed the area’s future land use in its comprehensive plan to business and light manufacturing. They\nalso rezoned Minnesota Power’s land to allow communication services, including housing for data storage.\n“We’re anticipating what’s coming down the line,” Ronchetti said. “There’s a lot of discussion, particularly at the state level, about\nfacilities that feed the future of data, AI, tech... So in anticipation of a potential project that may or may not ever materialize, we wanted\nto provide the option within our zoning code.”\nA letter from Mortenson obtained by the Minnesota Star Tribune asks a resident to consider selling their home.\n“We are working on site selection for an industrial project in Hermantown in the area of Morris Thomas Rd. Saint Louis River Rd and\nMidway Rd,” the letter reads. “We are working on behalf of one of our customers and are interested in buying your home.”\nA spokesman for Mortenson said he was unable to provide information on the client or details of the project.\nAt a meeting on April 21, Timothy Resberg, who lives east of the potential development, asked Hermantown’s City Council to say who\nwas buying land in the area and whether it’s a data center.\n“We would like to have the city council give us some information about that,” Resberg said. “So far we haven’t heard from anybody.”\nCity Administrator John Mulder said there are “private land transactions” occurring but Hermantown doesn’t know all the details.\nHermantown resident Mike Ralph, whose property borders the site, also asked at the April 21 meeting what the council knows about the\nindustrial project and the land purchases.\n“Not anything that’s public,” Boucher, the mayor, said.\nThe Hermantown site shows some hallmarks of a potential data center development. The planning document says construction would\ntake place over 5 to 10 years. It’s common for data centers to start small and expand over time.\nThe plot of land being studied is about as large as property where Amazon is proposing a data center in Becker. The development would\nalso be adjacent to a Minnesota Power substation and large transmission line. Minnesota Power has marketed the site as capable of\nsupporting a customer with high power needs, such as a data center, said Drew Johnson senior vice president of development with the\nMinnesota-based ﬁrm Oppidan.\nJohnson said his company was also tracking the land as part of its national database of possible data center locations. Oppidan has\nannounced plans for three large-scale data centers in the Twin Cities. There is signiﬁcant demand for land near electric infrastructure\nsuch as substations — which on that site is undergoing updates — and big power lines.8/13/25, 4:03 PM A massive development is proposed for a northeastern Minnesota city.

The vast\ndevelopable acreage is a rarity in the region.\nShare Comment\nABOUT THE WRITERS\nJana Hollingsworth\nDULUTH REPORTER\nJana Hollingsworth is a reporter covering a range of topics in Duluth and northeastern Minnesota for the Star Tribune.

The other\nparticipants are Global Infrastructure Partners, or GIP, an infrastructure investor that is being\nacquired by BlackRock, and MGX, a tech investor in the United Arab Emirates.\n“We are committed to ensuring AI helps advance innovation and drives growth across every\nsector of the economy,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a statement. He said the initiative\nbrings “together financial and industry leaders to build the infrastructure of the future and power\nit in a sustainable way.”\nThe group aims to assemble $30 billion of initial capital, with a future goal of bringing in up to\n$100 billion, including from debt financing.\nTech companies have been racing to build data centers full of Nvidia graphics processing units,\nor GPUs, that can run generative AI models such as those enabling OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot. \nM A R K E T S \nV I D E O \nW A T C H L I S T\nM E N ULIVES TREAM SIGN IN8/13/25, 4:05 PM Microsoft, BlackRock form GAIIP to invest in AI data centers, energy\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/microsoft-blackrock-form-gaiip-to-invest-in-ai-data-centers-energy.html 2/6\nDon’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\n•Nvidia gets price target hike from Goldman Sachs ahead of\nearnings\n•A bearish ‘double top’ pattern just formed in the Dow.

As discussed herein, \nLPI fully supports the ALJ Report and requests the Commission adopt the ALJ Report in its \nentirety.    \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n The ALJ Report represents a thorough review of the fulsome record in this proceeding, \ncontaining well -supported conclusions and findings that follow the record.  The exceptions of \nALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP” and, together, “the Partners” and, collectively with the Company, “the Petitioners”) insolently take  issue with nearly every aspect of the ALJ Report under the guise \nthat it is “deficient” or “inappropriate, ”\n1 using a tone unseen in Minnesota regulatory proceedings \nand demonstrating an utter lack of respect for the Minnesota regulatory process.  In so doing, \n \n1  Petitioners’ Exceptions to ALJ at 4, 18 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258- 221744- 02) \n(“Petitioners’ Exceptions”).  \n 2 Petitioners refuse to provide any substantive responses to various i ntervenors’ concerns or develop \ncreative or innovative methods for addressing documented issues with the Proposed Acquisition.  \nFurthermore, Petitioners have continually introduced new evidence in an attempt to fix a failing \nrecord.2  LPI reiterates its request that the Commission adopt the ALJ Report in full, including to \nrequire Minnesota Power to “ provide the full accounting of costs that were incurred in negotiating \nthe proposed acquisition and seeking its regulatory approvals, including the employee time spent in pursuing the acquisition.”\n3 \nII.  ANALYSIS  \nPetitioners’ Exceptions include numerous significant misrepresentations.  LPI will address \nthose misrepresentations, in turn, after highlighting the disappointing and troubling tenor of the Petitioners’ Exceptions.    \nA. The Egregious Tone of Petitioners’ Exceptions Demonstrate a Lack of Respect for the \nRegulatory Process  \nUnfortunately, Petitioners go beyond simply requesting the entire ALJ Report be \noverturned, choosing to question the intentions and integrity of the ALJ.  Taking multiple swings, \nPetitioners suggest the ALJ’s findings were “inappropriate and insulting,” “c avalier,” \n“inequitable,” and “ a sign of deep disrespect.”\n4  Petitioners go so far as to say  the ALJ  acted with  \n \n2  E.g., Petitioners’ Exceptions at 61 (discussing the Clean Firm Technology Fund in an effort to cure \ndeficiencies in its evidence that it will comply with the Carbon Free Standard) ; Petitioners’ Exceptions at \nAttach . B, pg. 1 (claiming the Settlement added “30 new commitments” despite evidence to the contrary \nand a refusal by Petitioners to answer discovery on this precise topic, as LPI addressed in detail in its initial \ncomment on the Settlement); and Attach . C (adding new tables and graphs that were not attached to witness \ntestimony or admitted during the evidentiary hearing process) . \n3  ALJ Report at 68, P 2.  \n4  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 18. \n 3 “carelessness .”5  To suggest an ALJ, who spent extensive time reviewing pre -filed testimony and \nmultiple days attentively listening to arguments before her, and reviewed an extremely fulsome \nrecord to produce her well -supported ALJ Report, has somehow been careless or irr esponsible \nbecause she found against the Petitioners is unfair and inappropriate.6  Exceptions exist to provide \nparties an avenue through which to rebut the findings and conclusions of an ALJ.  As such, Petitioners  may argue the merits of the decision or provide evidence to substantively rebut the \nALJ’s findings.  Indeed, that is what Petitioners represented they would do – respect the regulatory \nprocess.  Notwithstanding their claimed commitments of “respect for the regulatory compact and the regulatory framework in Minnesota,”\n7 the Partners “affirm[ing] that they are committed to the \nregulatory process in Minnesota and the jurisdiction of the Commission,”8 and that the Partners \n“recognize that failure to respect the regulatory compact adequately…could harm GIP’s reputation and potentially affect its existing regulated investments,”\n9 Petitioners submit what can only be \ndescribed as petulant commentary that appears to be an attempt to browbeat the state into accepting the Proposed Acquisition.  To be clear, personally attacking an  ALJ has no place in the Minnesota \nregulatory process .  To nonetheless do exactly that is a reflection on the Petitioners and their \nalleged “commitments” to the regulatory process in Minnesota.   \nThe exceptions from LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota (“LIUNA”)  use similar \ninflammatory phrases in an attempt to undermine the ALJ’s credibility , calling the Report \n \n5  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 21, n.81.  \n6  The CAH website reiterates the values of: “[a]pplying the law impartially, competently, and \ndiligently,” and “[f]ully considering information from everyone involved.”  Accessible here: \nhttps://mn.gov/oah/about-us/vision- mission -values/ .  \n7  Ex. MP-27 at 9:21 -23 (Cady Rebuttal ). \n8  Ex. MP-31 at 54:20-21 ( Alley Rebuttal ). \n9  Ex. MP-33 at 36:15-17 ( Bram Rebuttal ). \n 4 “lopsided,” containing “badly- skewed conclusions,” “worthless,” and ponders whether the ALJ \n“did not bother to read [the evidence] at all.” 10  LIUNA characterizes the ALJ’s decision not to \ncite its witness as “blindness,” positing the ALJ “used a magic eraser to wipe away inconvenient \ntestimony,” and made “willful erasures” that necessitate a “brand new ALJ.”11  Like Petitioners, \nLIUNA’s exceptions are unfortunately scant on substantive rebuttal.  The attacks launched on the \nALJ defy the norms of the contested case process and should be ignored by the Commission.   \nFurthermore, when the Commission evaluates the ALJ Report, it will find the ALJ  took a \n“hard look” at the case through genuine engagement and “reasoned decision -making,” as \ndemonstrated by her thorough review of the record and diligent participation throughout  the \nproceedings , confirming as deeply inaccurate any characterizations  to the contrary.12  Nothing \nabout this effort, or the ALJ Report, was arbitrary or capricious.  The Commission should see these \ninappropriate responses to the ALJ Report for what they are – distractions from the fact that the \nAcquisition, as proposed, does not  comport with the public interest.  Any  attempts  to rescue this \nfailure through harsh language or misleading statements should fall short of satisfying the \napplicable burden . \nB. The Petitioners Misrepresent Ratepayer Benefits in Attachment C  \nLPI takes issue with Petitioners’ Attachment C, containing a new graph that has not been \nproduced by the Petitioners that they claim  shows the Proposed Acquisition’s benefits .  While \n \n10  LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota (“LIUNA”)  Comments and Exceptions at 4 (Aug. 5, 2025) \n(eDocket No. 20258- 221753- 01) (“LIUNA Exceptions”) .  \n11  LIUNA Exceptions at 4 -5.  \n12  Matter of Denial of Contested Case Hearing Requests , 993 N.W.2d 627, 660 (Minn. 2023)  (“In \napplying the arbitrary or capricious standard, we consider whether ‘ a combination of danger signals ’ \nsuggests that ‘the agency has not taken a “hard look”  at the salient  problems ’ and ‘has not genuinely \nengaged in reasoned decision- making.’ ”).   \n 5 some of the information in Attachment C appears in other documents in the record, this  latest \niteration purports to visualize all the “benefits” the proposed settlement stipulation (“Settlement”)  \ncommitments will bestow on ratepayers.  However, as LPI’s initial comments on the Settlement \ndetailed, of the “ more than 70 discrete terms ,” only a few are truly new.13  The new commitments \ndo little to mitigate the substantial harm the Proposed Acquisition poses to ratepayers.14  Perhaps \nmost egregiously, Attachment C claims financial benefits of $132 million.  Comprising this $132 \nmillion, the Petitioners c laim “a combination of one -time cost savings and cost reductions over \ntime,” citing Attachment C.15  Between Attachment C and the two sentences offered in the body \nof the ir exceptions, Petitioners offer little explanation as to what savings truly comprise the $132 \nmillion.16  But even a cursory review demonstrates that the savings are either illusory or overstated.  \nFor example, maintaining existing commitments on collective bargaining agreements,17 charitable \ncontributions, and economic development are simply continuations of the status quo – not benefits.  \nOther alleged commitments, such as the Clean Firm Technology Fund, assume that the entirety of the commitment is made in the year 2026, which is actually contrary to the terms of paragraph \n1.63 of the Settlement.  Petitioners’ failure to adequately explain  Attachment C in their e xceptions, \n \n13  LPI Initial Comment on Proposed Settlement at 5 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258- 221758- 01) \n(“LPI Initial Comment on Proposed Settlement”).  \n14  See LPI Initial Comment on Proposed Settlement at 6 -12. \n15  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 36.  \n16  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 36 (“As described above, the Petitioners have committed to a wide range \nof rate reductions, non- recoverable investments, and a rate case stay -out that will mitigate rate impacts for \ncustomers.   Through a combination of one -time cost savings and cost reductions over time, these financial \nbenefits are estimated to save customers approximately $132 million.”) . \n17  Attachment C characterizes this as an “extension of existing collective Bargaining Agreement for \n2 years starting 2026,” which appears to simply be a reflection of the previously described status quo that \n“[a]pproval of the Acquisition further ensures the Company will be able to and will provide compensation \nand benefits to employees at their current level for at least two more years, providing important certainty \nto employees during a period of transition that  allows Minnesota Power to continue to recruit and retain a \ntalented workforce.”  Ex. MP -27 at  Sched. 1, pg. 4 of 7 ( Cady Rebuttal ).  \n 6 or produce it as part of testimony to afford parties the opportunity to conduct discovery, incorporate \na response into testimony, or otherwise address it during the evidentiary hearing process are additional reasons for the Commission to disregard the alle ged values contained in Attachment C.    \nC. The Petitioners Misrepresent the Evidentiary Hearing Process by Inappropriate ly \nAccus ing Various  Intervenors of Employing  “Litigation Tactics” \nPetitioners complain that i ntervenors made a “tactical litigation decision” not to cross -\nexamine their witnesses (a decision the ALJ also made).\n18  In addition to the Application itself, \nPetitioners witness es provided multiple rounds of written testimony on which i ntervenors and the \nALJ relied.  Intervenors are not to blame if Petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof through \nthese submissions.  Minnesota law does not direct that each witness in a contested case be questioned, nor does it provide such as a right.  Petitioners were represented by “numerous skilled national law firms and dozens of attorneys ,” who were well -equipped to respond to any \nunexpected events during litigation.\n19  Further, LPI cannot help but recognize the irony in that \nPetitioners themselves have been warned for their employment of suspect litigation tactics throughout the proceeding (e.g., the so- called “drafting error” that was in fact a late attempt by the \nPetitioners to change the substance of a document, and which the ALJ found had “absolutely no \ncredibility”).\n20  Intervenors ’ decision not to cross -examine certain of the Petitioners’ witnesses \nwas well within the norm of a contested case proceeding, and should not be inappropriately characterized as a “tactical litigation decision”\n21 that somehow deprived Petitioners of some right.  \n \n18  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 21. \n19  ALJ Report at 73, n.605 (emphasis added) . \n20  ALJ Report at 73, n.605.  \n21  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 21. \n 7 D. The Petitioners Misrepresent the Value of the ALJ’s Efforts in Overseeing the \nContested Case and Producing the ALJ Report  \nPetitioners’ Exceptions take issue with the ALJ Report, fundamentally, because the ALJ \nReport  finds Petitioners’ arguments unpersuasive and lacking credibility.  Rather than bolster their \narguments with substantive information, creative solutions, or credible evidence, the Petitioners \nspend a substantive chunk of their Exceptions attacking the ALJ  Report and the ALJ herself, \ncontending the ALJ’s general adoption of the Public Interest Intervenors’ Joint Proposed Findings \nsomehow dilutes the thoroughness or value of the ALJ Report.  As described below, t he \nPetitioners’ characterization of Minnesota law to support their complaints  paints an inaccurate \npicture and fails to acknowledge the ALJ’s discretion to adopt proposed findings to the degree her review of the evidence warrants.   \n1. Minnesota Law Allows Wholesale Adoption of Proposed Findings  \nPetitioners claim the ALJ Report is “so deficient,” they “cannot meaningfully recommend \nindividual changes to the Report” – yet they provide 70 pages of Exceptions.\n22  Petitioners’ \ninability to meaningfully address the deficiencies in their arguments speaks to the fact that none \nexist.  Petitioners’ behavior is a perpetuation of a glaring issue experienced by intervenors \nthroughout this proceeding – Petitioners have co ntinually failed to adequately address the \nsubstantive issues with the Proposed Acquisition or credible concerns raised by i ntervenors.  At \nthis point, LPI can only conclude this is because no suitable defenses to its credible concerns exist.  \nPetitioners take issue with the ALJ’s reliance on the Public Interest Intervenors’ Joint \nProposed Findings throughout her report.23  Petitioners understand that “[t]he fundamental purpose \n \n22  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 4.  \n23  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 5 -6. \n 8 of a report from an ALJ is to provide a complete account and analysis of the full record so that the \nCommission can exercise its independent judgment and fulfill its ultimate decision -making \nresponsibility.”24  Yet, Petitioners claim the ALJ Report, which constitutes a complete account and \nanalysis of the fulsome record, is deficient because it “does not provide a balanced and accurate account of the record,” and “completely ignor[es] and trivializ[es] the evidence and arguments \nprovided by the Petitioners….”\n25  However, Petitioners’ fail to consider that the ALJ Report did \nnot adopt their proposed findings because the ALJ found their evidence lacked credibility and did \nnot sufficiently address the potential harms of the Acquisition.26  Furthermore, Minnesota courts \nhave time and again affirmed the ability of a fact finder to adopt the findings of one party in their \nentirety.  For example, the Minnesota Court of Appeals has stated “ the verbatim adoption of a \nparty ’s proposed findings and conclusions of law is not reversible error per se .”27  In fact, the Court \nof Appeals has stated it will “continue to recognize the acceptability of this practice.”28  Therefore, \nthe ALJ has discretion to adopt proposed findings to the degree needed.   \nFurthermore , the ALJ in this proceeding did not wholesale adopt the proposed findings of \nthe Joint Intervenors – in fact, as Attachment E of the Petitioners’ Exceptions shows, the ALJ made \nseveral additions to the proposed findings ( e.g., including the fact that the Partners were the only \nbidders for the C ompany,29 and that the Acquisition will create unacceptable risks of rate increase \n \n24  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 3.  \n25  Petitioners’ Exceptions at 4. \n26  E.g., ALJ Report at 27- 28, PP 130- 31; ALJ Report at 38, P 131; ALJ Report at 30, P 135.  \n27  Bliss v. Bliss, 493 N.W.2d 583, 590 (Minn. Ct. App. 1992); see Sigurdson v. Isanti County , 408 \nN.W.2d 654, 657 (Minn. App. 1987), pet. for rev. denied  (Minn.  Aug. 19, 1987).  \n28  Bliss,  483 N.W.2d at 590.  \n29  ALJ Report at 8, P 38  \n 9 and rate shock).30  The Petitioners bear the burden to demonstrate the Proposed Acquisition \ncomports with the public interest.  If the evidence they provide does not effectively meet that \nburden, Petitioners should look to provide more credible evidence or generate new solutions to mitigate risk of harm  documented in the record, not disparage the ALJ Report. \n2. The Standard of Review Applied by the ALJ is Proper  \nThe ALJ correctly identified and applied the “net benefit” standard of review in this case, \ndespite Petitioners’ contentions to the contrary.\n31  Even under the lower “no harm” standard, the \nALJ Report found that “[t]he proposed deal is inconsistent with the public interest under either standard because it results in net harm to the public interest.”\n32  The ALJ’s findings are based on \nthe Petitioners ’ failure to advance a reasoned  theory to overcome (1) the critiques that the capital \nplan is overstated; (2) the fact that the only entities willing to proceed with the Acquisition are two overly aggressive and litigious companies; (3) and that granting the petition would be in consistent \nwith the public interest.\n33  If Petitioners could provide evidence that the Proposed Acquisition will \nprovide net benefits to ratepayers, they would.  However, their vociferous arguments against being made to do so underscore that they cannot provide evidence to that effect  and refuse to offer \nmeaningful commitments to ratepayers to overcome this failure .  LPI is therefore forced to \ncontinue objecting to the Proposed Acquisition as inconsistent with the public interest and \n \n30  ALJ Report at 39, P 173.  \n31  ALJ Report at 71 (“The net benefit standard protects customers who will ultimately bear the risks \ncreated by the transaction.  The standard thus best fits the intent of the Legislature to ensure that utility \nservices in Minnesota are provided reliably and at reasonable rates.  The net benefit standard also best \naddresses how the Commission has, in practice, considered cases under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 and comports \nwith how many other jurisdictions analyze the public interest standard.”) . \n32  ALJ Report at 67, P 15.  \n33  ALJ Report at 27, P 128; ALJ Report at 18- 19, P 88; ALJ Report at 71.  \n 10 respectfully request s that the Commission , which can and should protect customers who bear the \nrisks of  the Proposed Acquisition, apply the “net benefit” standard as stated by the ALJ.34   \n3. To Upend the ALJ Report Would Be Procedurally Improper and Erode the \nFoundation of Established Process for Contested Cases  \nMinnesota’s contested case process vests in an ALJ trust to scrupulously assure its \nproposed findings and conclusions are detailed, well -founded, and specific enough to allow for \nmeaningful review.35  Simply because an ALJ finds against one party or another does not mean \nthe ALJ did not make thorough or fair findings, that the entire r eport should be overturned, or the \nALJ themself condemned as not providing an “accurate” or “comprehensive” look at the \nAcquisition.36  To upend an ALJ Report and condemn it in the manner and tenor done by the \nPetitioners undermines Minnesota’s well -established and fair judicial system.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons LPI describes above, the Commission should adopt the detailed and extensive \nfindings and conclusions in the ALJ Report, including requir ing Minnesota Power to “ provide the \nfull accounting of costs that were incurred in negotiating the proposed acquisition and seeking its regulatory approvals, including the employee time spent in pursuing the acquisition.”\n37     \n \n \n34  ALJ Report at 71.  \n35  See City View Apartments v.

ANALYSIS  \n \nTo examine whether approval of the acquisition is consistent with the public interest, this \nproceeding should focus on applying the applicable legal standard to the factual record to assess \nwhether ALLETE has met its burden to show the potential benefits o f approving the Acquisition \noutweigh the potential risks. The primary purported benefit of the Acquisition is that it improves \nALLETE’s access to capital, which ALLETE claims is needed to comply with the Carbon Free Standard. \nThus, part of the Petitioners’  burden becomes showing (i) ALLETE currently lacks access to capital, and \n(ii) approving the Acquisition (which would result in ALLETE giving up its access to public markets to \nbecome solely reliant on the Partners for equity capital) would improve that ac cess. Finally, if ALLETE \nshows the Acquisition would improve its access to capital, it still must prove that benefit outweighs \nthe risks of approving the Acquisition. Throughout this proceeding, expert witnesses from six parties \nintroduced substantial evid ence of potential risks arising from the Acquisition. As the ALJ determined, \n \n1 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Notice of Comment Period on the Proposed Settlement, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (July 18, 2025) \n(“Commission Notice”).  \n2 \n the record does not support a finding that ALLETE has met its burden to show the Acquisition is \nneeded, or that the potential benefits of approving it outweigh the potential risks. The proposed \nSettlement reached between the Petitioners and the Department does not reset that balance. Thus, \nthe record supports denial of the Acquisition.  \n \nA. Response to Petitioners  \n \n Petitioners made numerous, wide- ranging arguments in their Exceptions to the ALJ Report. \nWe lack time to respond to all of Petitioners’ arguments; however, we respond to some.  \ni. Not adopting Petitioners’ proposed findings is not equivalent to not considering \nthem.  \n \nMuch of the Petitioners’ Exceptions are devoted  to suggesting that the ALJ ignored their \narguments in her Report.  The Petitioners overstate this concern.  It is common practice for \nAdministrative Law Judges to ask parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law  to \nassist the ALJ in writing her report .2 Two such sets of proposed findings were filed in this record: one \nwritten by  parties  opposing the Acquisition3 and the other by parties supporting it .4 Both are filed in \neDockets and available to the Commission. The Petitioners fairly note that much of t he ALJ Report \nclosely aligns with the proposed findings offered by the opposing parties . However, this does not  \nmean  that the ALJ made a decision “based only on part of the record” or  that the Report “does not \ninclude independently developed findings and conclusions.”5 The more logical explanation is that the \nALJ considered both sets of proposed findings and strongly agreed with one set over the other. In a \nmemorandum accompanying the Report, the ALJ explained, in her own words, her assessment of the applicable legal sta ndard and reason s for finding opposing parties’ arguments more persuasive .\n6  \n \n2 For example, Minnesota Power has filed such proposed findings in its recent, fully contested rate cases. See e.g., In the Matter \nof the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Utility Service in Minnesota, Minnesota Power’s \nProposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendation, Docket No. E -15/GR -21-355 (Aug.  1, 2022 ) \n3 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Joint Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations of the Public Interest \nIntervenors, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (May 29, 2025).  \n4 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Joint Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation to Approve the Acquisition, \nDocket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (May 29, 2025).  \n5 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Petitioners’ Exceptions to the ALJ Report, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (Aug. 4, 2025), p. 6 (“Petitioners’ \nExceptions”).  \n6 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Administrative Law Judge’s HCTS Report, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (July 15, 2025), p. 69 (“ALJ \nReport”).  \n3 \n  \nThe Petitioners further state:  \nThe Commission is responsible for deciding all cases, including this one, based on the record \nas a whole. As explained by the Minnesota Supreme Court, agency decision -makers must \n“make their own ‘independent decisions and not . . . rubber stamp the finding s of a hearing \nexaminer.’” The fundamental purpose of a report from an ALJ is to provide a complete account \nand analysis of the full record so that the Commission can exercise its independent judgment \nand fulfill its ultimate decision- making responsibility .7 \n \nWe agree the Commission is responsible for deciding all matters before it, based on the record as a \nwhole. We also agree that Commission decisions must be supported by substantial evidence and must \nnot be arbitrary and capricious.8 On the other hand, a “[r]ejection of the ALJ's recommendations \nwithout explanation. . . may  [also]  suggest that the agency exercised its will rather than its judgment \nand was therefore arbitrary and capricious. ”9 “[T]he ALJ’s report is only one part of the record,”10 but \nit is an important part. As overseer of the contested case proceeding, the ALJ permitted the Petitioners “the right to be heard; the right to the production of witnesses and documents; the taking of evidence; the examination and cross -examination of witnesses; the right to present argument; and a decision \non the merits.”\n11 As such, she afforded the Petitioners a fair administrative hearing and offered her \ninformed recommendation to the Commission based on  her assessment of  the evidentiary record \ndeveloped under  her oversight . If the Commission chooses to reject the ALJ Report or amend its \nfindings, it has the right to do so —but it must explain its reasoning for  arriving at conclusions different \nfrom the ALJ in a way that is grounded in substantial record evidence.   \nii. The Petitioners cite legislation creating the Carbon Free Standard when \nconvenient to their arguments and ignore it when it’s not.  \n The Petitioners claim the ALJ  Report “gets the law wrong” and that it “suggests the Commission \nshould reverse years of precedent” by applying  a net benefits test to determine whether the \nAcquisition is consistent with the public interest.\n12 In support of this claim, Petitioners state “the \nReport selectively relied on legislative findings to underscore customer interests, such as reliability \nand reasonable rates, while clearly neglecting the Legislature’s plain language directive that the \n \n7 Petitioners’ Exceptions at 3.  \n8 See Petitioners ’ Exceptions at 3, FN 9.  \n9 In re Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minn., 624 N.W.2d 264, 278 (Minn. 2001) . \n10 City of Moorhead v. Minn. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 343 N.W.2d 843, 847 (Minn. 1984).  \n11 State ex rel. Spurck v. Civil Serv. Bd., 226 Minn. 240, 247, 32 N.W.2d 574, 579 (1948)  \n12 Petitioners’ Exceptions at 22.  \n4 \n Commission should also consider ‘the financial and economic requirements of public utilities.’”13 \nHypocritically, the Petitioners, themselves, ignore the plain language in recent legislation establishing \nthe Carbon Free Standard, just as they state “[t]he primary goal of the Acquisition is to equip the \nCompany with reliable access to equity capital necessary to finance the investments in clean energy \ntechnologies needed to comply with the Carbon Free Standard.”14 Legislation establishing the Carbon \nFree Standard affirmatively requires the Commission to “take all reasonable actions within the \ncommission's statutory authority to ensure this section is implemented in a manner that maximizes \nnet benefits to all Minneso ta citizens.”15 This legislation was passed after the Commission considered \nprevious acquisitions in the cases cited by the Petitioners. It is appropriate of the ALJ to consider it \nand apply it to the present case, and it is inappropriate for Petitioners to ignore it in their description of the applicable legal standard.  \niii. CUB does not “speculate” that public markets may provide adequate capital to \nthe company; we rely on the Company’s own Annual  Reports.  \n \nPetitioners claim “[w]hile other parties speculated that public markets may provide adequate \ncapital to the Company, they provided no quantification or other evidence that this is a reasonable \nconclusion and operated from an academic perspective rather tha n with the utility’s (and the utility’s \nadvisors’, Partners’, and expert Quackenbush’s combined) expertise and real -world experience.”\n16 \nCUB’s conclusion  about public markets providing  ALLETE adequate access capital is grounded in the \nCompany’s own words, expressed in critical securities filing s signed by the C ompany’s top leadership  \nand prepared with the assistance of legal counsel . There is arguably no better  “real -world” document  \nexpressing ALLETE’s  perspectives on its  capital needs and ability to meet them than ALLETE’s own \nAnnual Report (Form 10 -K). The ALJ’s finding on this point is an objective, factual statement:  \nALLETE’s professed doubts about public market adequacy conflict with statements made to \ninvestors in its annual SEC filings. In its 2023 annual report, ALLETE told investors that it had \nadequate access to capital markets. Most recently, in its 2024 annual report filed in February \n2025, ALLETE again confirmed that it is “well positioned to meet our financing needs due to . . \n. access to capital markets.” Both the 2023 and 2024 10 -K filings were signed by ALLETE’s Chief \nExecutive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and every member of ALLETE’s Board .17 \n \n \n13 Id. at 89, citing Minn. Stat. §  216B.01.  \n14 Id. at 45 (“The primary goal of the Acquisition is to equip the Company with reliable access to equity capital necessary to \nfinance the investments in clean energy technologies needed to comply with the Carbon Free Standard.”)  \n15 Minn. Stat.  § 216B.691 Subd. 9 (emphasis added).  \n16 Petitioners’ Exceptions at  51. \n17 ALJ Report at 28 (internal citations omitted).  \n5 \n  The Petitioners attempt to dismiss the import of this evidence by suggesting “the Form 10 -K \nexpressly detailed that access to capital was a risk factor that could affect the Company’s ability to \nexecute its business plans, make capital expenditures, or pur sue other strategic actions .”18 This \nargument lacks merit. All public companies’  10-K Annual Reports  include risk factors that account for \na variety of risks that could affect the operations  and projections of the  company  filing it . Disclosing \nsuch potential risks is a  key purpose of the report.  Each of Xcel,19 OtterTail ,20 and CenterPoint21 include \nrisk factors in their latest annual reports  disclosing potential risks associated with an inability to access \nsufficient capital, yet none of those entities are seeking the Commission’s approval of a take- private \nacquisition. The inclusion of this type of general risk factor in ALLETE’s Annual Reports does not negate \nALLETE’s specific statements  about its specific 5-year capital  plan . This is particularly true in this case, \nwhere ALLETE’s w itnesses  literally point to the same document (Xcel’s 2024  10-K) as establishing the \nprojected capital needs AL LETE claims it will not be able to meet without the  Acquisition.22 Below is a \ntimeline showing  instances when ALLETE made conflicting statements, in short proximity, about its \nability to meet its 5 -year capital needs  via its access to public markets. The Petitioners have not \nadequately explained the audience -specific discrepancies in these  statements.  \nDate  SEC Filing/Shareholder communication  PUC Filing/Witness Statement  \nFeb. 4, 2024  According to the Proxy Statement, the Partners \noffered ALLETE $64.00 per share, describing it as \ntheir “best and final” offer.23  \nFeb. 16, 2024  According to the Proxy Statement, the ALLETE \nBoard received an overview of the Company’s \nstandalone financing plan and, after reviewing it, determined the Partner’s $64.00 offer was insufficient. In the weeks that followed, the Board \nelected to move ahead with the standalone plan.24  \nFeb. 20, 2024  The Company filed its 2023 Annual Report stating of \nits 5-year capital plan: “We are well positioned to \nmeet our financing needs due to adequate  \n \n18 Petitioners’ Exceptions at 47.  \n19 Xcel Energy, Inc. 2024 10- K Annual Report at 18 (“Utility operations require significant capital investment. As a result, we \nfrequently need to access capital markets.

The Petitioners’ new claims that the Acquisition will lower rates are \nunsupported and misleading . \n \nPetitioners claim “to the extent the Acquisition will have any impact on rates, it will result in \nlower rates . . . estimated to save customers approximately $132 million.”29 In support of this claim, \nPetitioner’s cite only Attachment C to their Exceptions. Attachment C contains three pages of charts \nand graphs providing minimal citations or explanations of how the Petitioners arrive at this $132 million figure.\n30 Most of these purported rate ”savings” are attributed to commitments made in the \nproposed Settlement.31 Page 2 of Attachment C shows that around two- thirds of the purported costs \nsavings ($88.4 million out of $132.4 million) are “one time” benefits, and $34 million of that $88.4 will likely expire after the Company files its next rate case.\n32 Finally, for the reasons discussed in our \nresponse to the Department’s comments, below, characterizing  the Acquisition as providing  “savings” \nto ratepayers is highly misleading.   \n \n25 Id. at 28, citing Ex.

The Petitioners mischaracterize the ALJ’s conclusions on public comments.  \n \nIn a summary of public comments attached to the Report, the ALJ states:  \nComments in support of the Acquisition largely repeated the Petitioner’s employee and public \nmessaging about the Acquisition - expressing that it will provide Minnesota Power with the \ncapital needed to satisfy the Carbon Free Standard while continuing to be a positive presence in the local community. Commenters frequently noted trust in the current leadership of the \nCompany. Numerous commentors in support of the Acquisition were Minnesota Power \nemployees. Many other supportive commentors were from nonprofit  or community \norganizations that receive funds from Minnesota Power. These commentors often indicated support for Minnesota Power but did not comment on the merits of the transaction itself. It is \nunclear whether these individuals felt obligated to support Minnesota Power due to the financial support they are provided by the company.\n33 \n \nPetitioners expressed frustration over this statement, suggesting the ALJ Report is “dismissive” of local \nentities and organizations supporting the Acquisition .34 To be clear, CUB agrees with Petitioners that \npublic comments are an important part of any record, and that, “[r]egardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with their viewpoints, public commenters should be treated with equal respect.”\n35 That \nsaid, the Petitioners mischaracterize the ALJ’s primary message. The primary point we believe the ALJ \nis making is that several of the community organizations and entities participating in public hearings \n(whose prominent names and reputation in the community inherently adds  weight to their testimony ) \nframed their comments in  support for the Acquisition  based  on an appreciation for the company and \ntrust in ALLETE’s leadership—not on their review of the Acquisition transaction , itself. We disagree \nwith the Petitioners’ suggestion that the ALJ’s comment goes as far as insinuating “the supporters of \nthe Acquisition lack integrity and would make false statements for alleged financial gain.”  \nB. Response to the Department \n \nBetween filing initial comments and reply comments, we have reflected further on the \nDepartment’s letter accompanying the proposed Settlement, which suggests approval of the \nAcquisition would “deliver immediate ratepayer benefits, ” including a cumulative $105.9 mil lion in \n“ratepayer savings.”36 The Department arrives at this number by pointing to three sources of \nratepayer benefits: i) a reduced ROE that “will save ratepayers approximately $5.5 million over the \n \n33 ALJ Report at Attachment A.  \n34 Petitioners’ Exceptions at 17.  \n35 Id. at 20.  \n36 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Department Letter Accompanying Settlement Stipulation, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (July 11, 2025).  \n8 \n next two years;” ii) a one- year rate case stay out that “will save customers approximately $25 million \nduring the next year”, and iii) the suggestion that the “settlement requires Minnesota Power to begin \npromptly refunding approximately $75.4 million in e xisting land sale proceeds to customers.”37 For \nthe reasons discussed below, the Department risks misleading the Commission and the public by \ndescribing the settlement as producing ratepayer savings in this way.  \nFirst, we agree that a reduced ROE would immediately benefit ratepayers in the short term. \nWe also have no reason to disagree with the Department’s calculation suggesting this change would \nsave ratepayers $5.5 million over two years. Though we agree this i s a ratepayer benefit, the savings \nassociated with it will be relatively small once this amount is distributed across Minnesota Power’s \ncustomer base. Also,  Minnesota Power will likely seek an ROE increase in its next rate case.  \nSecond, we disagree with the suggestion that the settlement , itself, will save ratepayers $25 \nmillion by requiring Minnesota Power to wait another year to file a rate case. In arriving at this number, \nthe Department points to  interim rate increases in Minnesota Power’s last four rate cases, noting \n“[w]hile a one -year rate case stay -out’s exact value depends on the size of the utility’s claimed revenue \ndeficiency and the final rates ultimately approved the Commission, experienc e suggests that the stay -\nout wi ll be meaningful.”38  \n Fig.1 – Interim Rate Increases cited by the Department \n \nThese numbers offer valid estimates of  the settlement’s  costs savings only if Minnesota Power intends \nto file a rate case in November 2025  but will not do so solely because of the settlement . We are not \naware of any evidence suggesting that Minnesota Power intends or is able to file a rate case that \nquickly —only  one month after the Commission plans  to hold a hearing  deciding whether to approve \nthe Acquisition and possibly even before the Commission  would issue a written  order  memorializing \nthat decision .39 And, e ven if the proposed Settlement truly  presents the only obstacle to Minnesota \n \n37 Id. \n38 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Notice of Comment Period on the Proposed Settlement, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 ( Aug.  4, 2025) , p. \n8 (“Department Initial Comments ”). \n39 Though it has not been scheduled yet, it is our understanding the Commission intends to hold a two -day hearing in late \nSeptember and/or early October.  \n\n9 \n Power filing a rate case this year, interim rates are temporary  and subject to  refund if  Minnesota \nPower fails to meet its burden to prove the requested rate increase is just and reasonable . The interim \nrate increases in the table above, for example,  do not account for  the refunds owed to customers in  \neach  one of th ose cases.40 All told, it is misleading  to describe this aspect of the settlement  as \nproducing $25 million in rate savings when  it may not actually delay Minnesota Power’s  next rate \nincrease.  \nSecond , we are troubled by the suggestion that the settlement would save ratepayers over \n$75 million by accelerating  payments the Department acknowledges “were always owed to \nratepayers.”41 As we noted  in our initial comments, i n an order issued almost four years ago, the \nCommission authorized Minnesota Power to “defer all proceeds from the land sales into a regulatory \nliability that would be refunded (credited) to customers in either a future rate case or through the Renewable R esources Rider.”\n42 The Department did not win these cost savings through its \nnegotiations with the Petitioners  in this case . A more  accurate  way to describe  the value of  this \nsettlement term is as accelerating  the fulfillment of a credit already owed to customers, not the \ncreation of $ 75 million in new  rate savings  derived from the settlement  or the Acquisition.   \nFor reasons expressed in our initial comments, we generally  do not  support the proposed \nfindings the Department recommends in its initial comments . For the reasons  discussed above, we \nparticularly and strongly oppose the Department’s recommendation that the Commission adopt its \nproposed finding 222a, which reads:  \n222a. The stipulation is sufficiently responsive to concerns raised by the Administrative Law \nJudge and Intervenors regarding ratepayer financial harm risks. The stipulation requires \nALLETE to reduce its regulated ROE by 13 basis points for ratemaking purp oses and waive its \nright to file a rate case until November 1, 2026. It also requires ALLETE to begin refunding $74.5 million in prior landsale revenues to customers. These requirements, memorialized in \nthe stipulation, will provide customers with sufficie nt financial benefits such that the \nacquisition is consistent with the public interest.    \n \n40 See, e.g, In the Matter of Application by Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in Minnesota, \nSupplemental Filing, Docket No. E015/GR -23-155 (June 30, 2025); In the Matter of the Application by Minnesota Power for  \nAuthority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in Minnesota , Compliance Filing, Docket No. E015/GR -21-335 (Dec. 6, 2023); In the \nMatter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Utility Service in Minnesota , Compliance \nFiling, Docket No. E015/GR -19-442 (Nov. 2, 2020); In the Matter of the Application of  Minnesota Power for Authority to \nIncrease  Rates for Electric Utility Service in Minnesota, Compliance Filing, Docket No. E015/GR -16-664 (June 10, 2019).  \n41 Department Initial Comments at 8, citing Stipulation ¶ 1.45.  \n42 In the Matter of the Petition by Minnesota Power for Approval of Land Sales, Order Allowing Land Sales and Establishing \nConditions, Docket No. E -015/PA -20-265 (Nov. 18, 2021).  \n10 \n Again, i t would be incorrect and misleading for the Commission to characterize the Acquisition as \nproviding “customers with sufficient financial benefits” in this way.  \n \nC. Response to Labor Parties  \n \ni. LIUNA  \n \nLIUNA  condescendingly ascribes to CUB a straw argument of L IUNA’s own invention that \ndemonstrates an ongoing misunderstanding  of CUB’s concerns.43 Contrary to LIUNA’s suggestion, o ur \nconcern is not that the Partners will  newly  seek to maximize profits while shareholders of publicly  \ntraded utility companies do not. Rather, our concern is that two large , sophisticated investors will both  \ncontrol  ALLETE  and be its only sources of equity capita l. While  all investors have an interest in earning \na return on  their investment, none of ALLETE’s current shareholders have the ability to unilaterally \nappoint  multiple  directors  to ALLETE’s Board of Directors ; none have consent rights over decisions \naffecting ALLETE/Minnesota Power ; and none are one of only  two sources of ALLETE’s equity capital . \nIf the Acquisition is approved, the Partners’ control of the Company, c ombined with the ir need to \nrecoup a  19-22% premium  before earning a ny return on their investment, creates new risks not  \nequally present in ALLETE’s current ownership and governance structure . For the Acquisition to be \nconsistent with the public interest, t hose new risks must be out balanced by new benefits created by \nthe Acquisition.  After overseeing the contested case process, reviewing the evidentiary record, \nlistening to parties’ cross examination, reading parties’ legal briefs, and considering the Department’s \nSettlement, the ALJ properly found “the pro posed governance structures fail to adequately balance \nthe needs of owners, ratepayers, and the community, and pose the risk of outsized influence by the \nPartners on the decision -making authority of company management.”44 LIUNA’s comments seek to \ndistract from these arguments without meaningfully addressing them.  \n \n \n \n \n43 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, LIUNA Initial Comments Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (Aug. 4, 2025), p. 8 FN 7  (“Watching sophisticated \nadvocates such as OAG and CUB, who regularly inveigh against utility profit -seeking, treat the boards and shareholders of \npublicly -traded utilities as if they belonged to charitable foundations rather than for -profit businesses is a “through -the-\nlooking -glass” experience. We trust, however, that their newfound appreciation for the wisdom, restraint and public -interest \norientation of publicly -traded utilities is tactical and not permanent.”)  \n44 ALJ Report at 261.  \n11 \n ii. International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49 and the North Central \nStates Regional Council of Carpenters  \n \nThe August 4, 2025 version of  the initial comments of the International Union of Operating \nEngineers Local 49 and the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters (the \n“Carpenters/49ers”) opens with this statement:  \n \nOn behalf of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49 and the North Central \nStates Regional Council of Carpenters, which represent over 25,000 members across \nMinnesota, we fully support the ALJ (Administrative Law Judge) report and its \nrecommendations for the settlement regarding the acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension \nPlan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.45 \n  \nThe fundamental  errors reflected in this statement  suggest  the Carpenters/49ers did not review the \nALJ Report  at even a cursory level . These error s were quickly revised in a second, \"corrected version\" \nof the Carpenters/49ers’  initial comments  filed on August 5th .46 Instead of supporting the ALJ Report, \nthe corrected version supports the proposed Settlement.47 This revised comment was filed without \nexplanation  but seemingly  after other parties noted the error. Indeed, the metadata of the \"corrected \nversion\" pdf lists one of the Partners' counsel as the document's author.48 To be clear, we understand \nand respect organized labor’s concern that their members retain access to quality, good -paying jobs, \nand that Minnesota Power has long been a good partner to these unions. At the same time, actions \nlike this create the impression that  the Carpenters/49ers’ support for the Acquisition  and proposed \nSettlement  may have been disproportionately influenced by the Partners, rather than  be based on \nthe Carpenters/49ers’ own robust assessment of the totality of record evidence.   \n \n \n \n \n45 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Initial Comments of North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters/IUOE Local 49, Docket No. E -\n015/PA -24-198 (Aug. 4, 2025)  (“On behalf of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49 and the North Central \nStates Regional Council of Carpenters, which represent over 25,000 members across Minnesota, we fully support the ALJ \n(Administrative Law Judge) report and its re commendations for the settlement regarding the acquisition of ALLETE by Canada \nPension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.”)  \n46 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, CORRECTED Initial Comments of North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters/IUOE Local 49, \nDocket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (Aug. 5, 2025).  \n47 Id.  \n48 The metadata of a pdf can be accessed by clicking Ctl+D while in the downloaded document, or by accessing “document \nproperties” in the dropdown menu at the top -left corner of the document.  \n12 \n D. Response to Fresh Energy, C lean Grid Alliance, Center for Energy and Environment, \nand Clean Energy Economy Minnesota  \n \nFresh Energy, Clean Grid Alliance (“CGA”), Center for Energy and Environment (“CEE”), and \nClean Energy Economy Minnesota (“CEEM”), filed 11th hour comments supporting approval of the \nAcquisition. It is our understanding that these parties were contacted by proponents of the Acquisition \nin late July —about two weeks before Exceptions to the ALJ Report and initial comments on the \nproposed Settlemen t were due. The comments are brief, minimally substantive, and repeat high -level \ntalking points offered by propone nts of the Acquisition. The y are predicated on the assumption that \nthe acquisition will improve Minnesota Power’s access to capital and, therefore, its ability to meet \nMinnesota’s Carbon Free Standard. CUB agrees with these organizations’  strong support for the \nCarbon Free Standard. We also do not dispute that the utility faces a need for substantial capital investment in the coming years. However, as discussed above, the record does not demonstrate that \nALLETE currently lacks access to ca pital from the pub lic markets nor that approving the Acquisition \nwould improve that access. The record does show that the Acquisition is likely to generate harms to Minnesota Power ratepayers.  \nWhile we respect each entity’s right to share their opinion and recommendations, it is \nimportant that the Commission recognize these organizations  have not meaningfully participated in \nthis docket. To our knowledge, t hey did not: file comments on the Petition when it was first filed in \nJuly 2024; petition to intervene in the contested case;  hire an expert to aid in their review ; issue or \nrespond to discovery ; cross examine other parties’ witnesses (or witness others’ cross examination); \nparticipate in public hearings ; prepare legal briefs; or otherwise grapple with the complex factual and \nlegal arguments CUB and other parties have been grappling with for the past year. Likewise, n one of \nthe signatories to these organizations’  comments (and no one at all  affiliated with CGA, CEE,  or CEEM ) \nare on  the service list for this docket.\n49 As such, these organizations  clearly did not ha ve time to \nmeaningfully review —or even access50—the full evidentiary record before  filing their comments . \nGeneral support for the Clean Energy Standard should not and must not dilute the importance of \n \n49 See the Service List attached to the Commission’s Notice of Schedule for Exceptions to the ALJ Report, issued July 18, 2025.  \n50 As opposing parties and the ALJ have noted, a lot of the most compelling evidence is hidden from public view behind the \nPartners’ highly confidential trade secret designations. The  protection of this information has been an ongoing issue in this \ncase. For example, the Highly Confidential Protective Order generally permits only two individuals from each party to the \ncontested case to have access to HCTS documents. It is unclear to us whether/how much access the Partners provided to \nthese organizations  before they filed comments —and, if such access was granted, whether or how these entities could have \nreviewed all of the HCTS documents added to the evidentiary record over this year -long proceeding.  \n13 \n diligently considering the evidence in this record and balancing the potential risks against the potential \nbenefits of approving the Acquisition.  The Commission should weigh the depth  of the se organizations’  \ncomments and support accordingly.  \n \nE. Response to the Office of the Attorney General  \n \nLike CUB, the OAG supports the ALJ report in full and recommends the Commission adopt it.51 \nHowever, the OAG takes exception to the ALJ Report lacking a ruling on an OAG motion  to lift trade -\nsecret designations in certain documents ALLETE provided to the Partners.52 Specifically, these \ndocuments  include projections of Minnesota Power’s revenue requirements over 2023 -2032.53 We \nagree with the arguments the OAG include d in its prior motion  and Exceptions to the ALJ Report  as to \nwhy trade secret designations in these documents should be lifted . As the Department noted in a \nmemorandum supporting the OAG’s motion, there is “clearly a significant public interest” in \nunderstanding the rate increases on which the proposed Acquisition is premised.54 And, a s the OAG \nnoted, withholding this information from public view “deprives the public of important context on a matter of great concern to Minnesota Power’s ratepayers, northern Minnesota, and the state as a whole.”\n55 CUB supports the motion and the OAG’s request that the Commission make a ruling on it.  \n \nII. Conclusion  \n \nALLETE has not met its burden to prove the Acquisition is necessary or consistent with the \npublic interest. On balance, the risks of potential harm arising from the Acquisition outweigh its \npotential benefits , and the proposed Settlement does not reset that balance. T herefore, the  \nCommission should deny  the Acquisition.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n51 OAG Exceptions at 1.  \n52 Id. at 2.  \n53 Id. at 4, citing Response to Sierra Club IR No. 26 and Response to OAG IR No. 42.  \n54 Id. at 3-4, citing Department Memo at 2 (Mar. 25, 2025).  \n55 Id. at 5.  \n14 \n Dated: August 1 4, 2025     Respectfully submitted,  \n         \n       /s/ Brian C.

PAUL, MINNESOTA 55101- 2147 \n \nKatie Sieben  \nJoseph Sullivan \nHwikwon Ham  \nAudrey Partridge  \nJohn Tuma  Chair  \nVice Chair  \nCommissioner  \nCommissioner  \nCommissioner  \n \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota \nPower for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners  Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 \n \nREPLY COMMENTS AND \nARGUMENTS AND EXCEPTIONS  OF \nTHE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT  OF \nCOMMERCE  \n \n The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission should approve the acquisition of ALLETE, \nInc. by Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (“CCPIB”) and Global Infrastructure Partners \n(“GIP”) subject to their  commitments in the July 11 settlement stipulation.1 These commitments \nare enough to render  the acquisition consistent with the public interest. Indeed, even intervenors \nopposed to the acquisition concede that the stipulation will deliver  some  material benefits for \nratepayers. Moreover, the criticism leveled at the stipulation either misread s the agreement or is \ninternally inconsistent. These critiques  should not deter the Commission from approving the \nacquisition subject to the stipulation.  \nANALYSIS  \n Subject to the agreed -upon commitments , the acquisition is consistent with the public \ninterest.2 Many intervenors, including those who remain opposed to the acquisition, concede the \nstipulation secures material benefits for ALLETE’s customers. And intervenor criticism of \n \n1 Stipulation  (July 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257- 220879- 01).  \n2 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd. 1. \n2 Petitioners’  commitments regarding  capital, clean -firm technology, and affiliated- interest  statute \ncompliance is  misplaced.  \nA. The Stipulation Delivers Material Benefits.  \n As outlined in the Department’s prior argument, the commitments in the stipulation \nmaterially benefit Minnesota consumers.3 Most i ntervenors and commenters acknowledge that the \nstipulation provides material benefits for ALLETE’s customers. And the  broad coalition  of \nsupporters should give the Commission confidence in relying on the stipulation to approve the \nacquisition.  \nAlthough some intervenors remain opposed to the acquisition, several acknowledge the \nstipulation ’s benefits . The Citizens Utility Board  of Minnesota , for example, acknowledges that \nthe stipulation’s  return on equity (“ROE”) reduction, clean firm technology fund, low -income \ncustomer arrearages paydown,  and the books -and-records access provisions are new, material \nbenefits.4 And the Large Power Intervenors  (“LPI”)  similarly concede that “the creation of the \nClean Firm Technology Fund, . . . a reduction in Minnesota Power’s authorized ROE from 9.78% to 9.65%, and a commitment not to file a rate case before November 1, 2026” are material benefits.\n5 \nWhile opponents  assert that these benefits (along with others memorialized in the \nstipulation) are insufficient, they do not provide grounds for denying the acquisition. S ome \ncriticism is rooted in individual preferences rather than  the stipulation’s merits. LPI, for example, \ncriticizes the $50 million clean firm technology fund , not because the fund does not benefit \nconsumers , but because its mining and industrial members prefer a  rate credit.6 On the other hand, \n \n3 DOC Initial Cmts. & Exceptions at 2 -4 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258 -221732- 01).  \n4 CUB Initial Cmts. at 15 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258- 221742- 03). \n5 LPI Initial Cmts. at 13 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258- 221745- 02). \n6 Id. at 13 -14.  \n3 Sierra Club and the Office of the Attorney General —Residential Utilities Division  (“OAG”) \ncriticize the fund , in part, as  being too small  to have a meaningful impact .7 That these parties  might \nhave struck a different balance between competing interests, however, does not mean the collective \npackage of benefits delivered by the stipulation are insufficient.   \nUnlike  the few parties who would prefer other terms  or denial , many intervenors and \ncommenters view the stipulation positively. LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota touts the \nstipulation as a “monumental achievement” that secures “a suite of new and substantial \ncommitments that amplify the public benefits of the deal[ .]”8 The Minnesota Building and \nConstruction Trades Council concurs that the stipulation “ improves greatly upon [the]  transaction” \nand “includes more than a dozen significant concessions on the part of ALLETE and Investors.”9 \nAnd IBEW Local 31, which represents many of ALLETE’s employees, applauds  the agreement  \nfor “securing meaningful stipulations and enforceable language that serve [s] the public interest.”10 \nLabor organizations are not the only supporters either. E nergy and environmental policy groups  \npraise the stipulation’s affordability and clean firm technology provisions.11 This diverse coalition \nshould give the Commission confidence that the stipulation delivers sufficient benefits to render \nthe acquisition consistent with the public interest.  \nB. The Five- Year Capital Commitment’s Enforcement Provision  is Sufficient.  \n The OAG expresses concern with the capital commitment provision’s adequacy. This \nprovision requires Alloy Parent to fund Minnesota Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan \n \n7 Sierra Club Initial Cmts. at 13 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258- 221736- 03); OAG Initial Cmts. \nat 10 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258- 221723- 02).  \n8 LIUNA Initial Cmts. at 1 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258- 221753- 01). \n9 Minnesota Building Trades Initial Cmts. at 5 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258- 221752- 01). \n10 IBEW Local 31 Initial Cmts. at 4 (Aug. 5, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258 -221748- 01).  \n11 Fresh Energy & CCA Initial Cmts. at 3 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258 -221738- 01); CEE & \nCEEM Initial Cmts. at 3 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket no. 20258- 221722- 01). \n4 reflected in its February 2025 10- K filing, subject to prospective reasonable and prudent plan \nadjustments.12 The OAG asserts that  the “reasonable and prudent plan adjustments” language is \ntoo vague and may permit CPPIB and GIP (“the Partners”) to circumvent  their funding \nobligations .13 This criticism is misplaced .  \n First, the Partners cannot unilaterally change ALLETE’s regulated capital needs. \nALLETE’s regulated capital needs  reflect  both long- term forecasts and planned near-term \nspending. Although the Partners may control ALLETE’s long- term forecasted capital needs , the \nCommission will control the utility’s actual regulated capital  expenditures . The Commission must \napprove near -term capital investment s through the integrated- resource  planning and certificate -of-\nneed processes.14 And i t is not only the Commission with a role. S takeholders can offer input  in \nthese iterative determinations that will evolve as forecasted needs become more precise, \ntechnological developments occur, and economic and policy considerations shift.   Second, the OAG’s concern that the Partners might shrink ALLETE’s capital plans to \navoid making otherwise required payments is internally inconsistent with  the OAG’s earlier \ncriticism that the Partners will overinvest in ALLETE’s regulated system. Previously, the OAG \nasserted that ALLETE’s capital forecasts may  be highly inflated, amount ing to no more than a \n“capital wish list.”\n15 This is an understandable concern given that “[i]nvesting capital is one of the \nprimary ways that utilities and their shareholders generate profit.”16 But if  resource -planning and \ncertificate -of-need processes do determine that ALLETE’s capital needs are overstated , it will be \n \n12 OAG Initial Cmts. at 9; Stipulation ¶¶ 1.3 -1.5. \n13 Id. \n14 Minn. Stat. § 216B.2422, subd. 2(a) (requiring utilities to periodically file resource plans subject \nto commission approval, rejection or modification) , Minn. Stat. § 216B.243, subd. 2 (requiring \ncommission approval before a large energy facility may be sited or constructed).  \n15 OAG Reply Br. at 8 (May 29, 2025) (eDocket no. 20255- 219385- 02). \n16 Ex. OAG- 403 at 5 (Lebens Surrebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253- 216790- 02). \n5 a feature not a bug that the capital commitment provision does not require the Partners to \novercapitalize ALLETE.  \n In short, the stipulation’s  capital commitment provisions strike an appropriate balance \nbetween enforceability and flexibi lity. The Commission should take confidence in relying on them . \nC. The Stipulati on’s Clean Firm Technology Fund Provision Does Not Contain a \n“Loophole.”    \n  As previously established, the clean firm technology fund requires Petitioners to contribute \n$50 million in investor capital for clean -firm technology investments approved by the \nCommission.17 The stipulation defines “clean- firm technology” to mean “a carbon -free resource, \nas defined by Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 1(b), that can be dispatched and provide energy continuously for a duration of 50 hours  or more.”\n18 ALLETE also may propose projects that do \nnot meet this exact definition after obtaining the Department’s consent.19 Despite th ese strict terms, \nthe Sierra Club speculates that the fund could be used to finance “power plants that burn solid \nwaste, biomass, or renewable natural gas” due to a purported “ loophole.”20 In short, Sierra Club  \ntheorizes that the Commission and Department would distort the  stipulation’s  intent to shoehorn \nin thermal generation projects.21 But Sierra Club’s concerns rely on a n unreasonable reading  of \nthe agreement .  \n The Department sought the fund’s creation  during stipulation negotiations because the \nagency believes it i s important to secure support  for emerging technologies that can  replace fossil \nfuel firm -dispatchable resources.22 Accordingly, financing fossil fuel projects  with the fund, as \n \n17 Stipulation ¶ 1.63.  \n18 Id. ¶ 1.63(c).  \n19 Id.  \n20 Sierra Club Initial Cmts. at 12.  \n21 Id. \n22 Stipulation ¶  1.63(c).  \n6 Sierra Club speculates  the Commission and Department would permit , would be wholly contrary \nto the fund’s purpose  and the Department’s intent . The Department expects that the  fund will \nfinance l ong-duration battery investments and similar types of projects. But because t echnological \nchange is occurring rapidly, the Department did not want to preclude other technologies that could \nhelp meet Minnesota’s energy transition goals  with an overly rigid definition.  \n The fund also has other guardrails against misuse. T o prevent ALLETE from proposing a \ntechnology that the Department  views as inconsistent with the fund’s goals, the stipulation requires \nALLETE to seek Department approval before bringing the Commission a proposal not falling \nwithin the “clean firm technology” definition.23 And a ny project financed through the fund would  \nlikely  require Commission approval through a resource planning or certificate of need docket . As \na result, there will be a public and transparent process through which other interested parties can \nparticipate in funding decisions.  \nIn sum, Sierra Club’s concern that the fund will be used to finance traditional thermal \ngenerating system s rather than cutting- edge clean energy technology is misplaced. As discussed \nabove, this is inconsistent with the fund’s purpose and t here are several safeguards to prevent \nmisuse.  \nD. The Stipulation Leaves Open Affiliated -Interest Statute Compliance. \n The OAG claims that the stipulation does not require full compliance with Minnesota’s \naffiliated -interest statute.24 The OAG asserts by requir ing ALLETE to report certain types of \ninterests , the stipulation waives  other  statutory requirements .25 It does not . The affiliated interest \nreporting requirements contained in the agreement are “[i]n addition to, and not in abrogation of, \n \n23 Id.  \n24 OAG Initial Cmts. at 19.  \n25 Id. \n7 any obligations pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 216B.48” that Petitioners  otherwise owe.26 The \nCommission will have to determine ALLETE’s  obligations under section 216B.48, accounting for  \nthe Administrative Law Judge’s statutory analysis .  \nCONCLUSION \n Because the stipulation is sufficiently responsive to intervenor concerns, the Commission \nshould find that  the acquisition is consistent with the public interes t.

INTRODUCTION  \nALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power,1 Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP \nInvestments” ) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP” and, together, “the Partners”  and, \ncollectively with the Company, “the Petitioners”) respectfully submit this Reply to Exceptions and \nComments on Settlement  filed on August 4 , 2025  (“Reply ”).  \nPetitioners’ Exceptions2 focused on  deep -seated concerns with the ALJ Report in this \nproceeding, and on the  benefits of the Acquisition as a whole , including the additional tangible \npublic interest benefits provided by  the Settlement Stipulation (“Settlement”) between the \nPetitioners and the Minnesota Department of Commerce (“Department”) .3 These benefits would  \nnot exist  without the Acquisition and Settlement . In this Reply , the Petitioners focus on  a subset \nof key issues argued by Opposing Parties4 in their Exceptions and comments on the Settlement . \nAs discussed below, Opposing Parties continue to claim risks that have little or no record support \nor that have been effectively addressed by the Settlement.   \nPetitioners respectfully ask the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”)  to \nrecognize that a party ’s claim that there is a risk does not necessarily translate into record evidence \nof risk, and that there are a wide variety of  objectively measured  benefits to the Acquisition  and \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout  this Reply  to Exceptions  and \nComments  on Settlement filed August 4, 2025 , “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in \nMinnesota. Unless otherwise specifically defined, references to “ALLETE” indicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire \nenterprise including Minnesota Power and all regulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more \ngeneral reference to ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n2 The Petitioners’ Exceptions were filed in response to the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and \nRecommendations (the “ALJ Report”) of Administrative Law Judge Megan J. McKenzie.  In the Matter of the Petition \nof Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure \nPartners , Docket No. E-015/PA -24-198, Exceptions of Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, \nAnd Global Infrastructure Partners at 1 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258 -221744 -02) (“Petitioners’ Exceptions”); \nALJ Report (July 15, 2025) (eDocket Nos. 20257 -221020 -01, 20257 -221061 -02 (HCTS)).  \n3 See generally  Settlement (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n4 In this Reply , “Opposing Parties” refers to parties who recommended rejection of the Acquisition in their Initial \nBriefs, including the Office of the Attorney General —Residential Utilities Division (“OAG”), Citizens Utility Board \nof Minnesota (“CUB”), Large Power Inter venors (“LPI”), Sierra Club, and CURE.  \n \n2 risk mitigations that address such claims.  In particular, the Settlement reflects  roughly five months \nof difficult  negotiations between the Department and the Petitioners  to thoroughly address the \nconcerns  identified by the Department and further ensure the Acquisition is in the public interest.  \nThe remainder of this Repl y will (1) summarize the comments filed in support of the \nAcquisition from stakeholders of many different perspectives; (2) explain why the commitments \nin the Settlement ensure that the Acquisition is consistent with the public interest; (3) demonstrate \nthat the Acquisition and Settlement will provide rate savings for customers; (4) explain why the \nSettlement is fully enforceable and ensures that the Commission’s authority over Minnesota Power \nis unchanged; and (5) demonstrate that  the Partners will be responsible investors for ALLETE and \nMinnesota Power.  \nAs stated in Petitioners’ Exceptions, the Acquisition and Settlement  ensure  that Minnesota \nPower’s customers and the public will benefit from the Acquisition in a manner that would  not be \npossible if ALLETE were to remain  a publicly  traded company ; and will be protected from \npossible risks . Therefore, the Commission should approve the Acquisition and the Settlement.   \nII. OVERVIEW OF SUPPORTING COMMENTS  \nBefore discussing the claims of Opposing Parties, it is important to recognize the broad \narray of in -depth comments supporting the Acquisition and Settlement. Those  comments were \nthoughtful and detailed and they came from a broad cross section of public interest organizations \nand members of the public, including: (1) the Department; (2) Fresh Energy , (3) Clean Grid \nAlliance  (“CGA ”);5 (4) Center for Energy and Environment  (“CEE”); (5)  Clean Energy Economy \n(“CEEM”);6 (6) the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW ”) Local 31 ;7 (7) \n \n5 Joint  Comments of Fresh Energy and CGA  (Aug. 4, 2025 ) (eDocket No.  20258 -221738 -01). \n6 CEE and C EEM ’s Initial Comments  (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258 -221722 -01). \n7 IBEW Local 31 - Exceptions to the Administrative Law Judge’s Report  (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258 -221748 -\n01) (“IBEW Local 31 Exceptions ”). \n \n3 North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters ; (8) the International Union of Operating \nEngineers  (“IUOE ”) Local 49 ;8 (9) LIUNA  Minnesota and North Dakota (“LIUNA ”);9 (10) \nEnergy  CENTS  Coalition  (“ECC ”);10 (11) the Duluth, Grand Rapids, Hermantown, and Little Falls \nChambers of Commerce ;11 and (12) Minnesota Building & Construction Trades Council  (the \n“Building Trades”)12 in Minnesota Power’s service territory.  \nThese comments are thoughtful and informed while appropriately recognizing in various \nways that the reliable  access to capital provided by this Acquisition and further secured by the  \nSettlement  is critical to providing jobs and quality utility service, complying with the Carbon Free \nStandard, and supporting the needs of the Company’s most vulnerable customers. These \ncommenters provide meaningful analysis along with pragmatic, real -world public i nterest \nperspectives to the consideration of the Acquisition an d Settlement. Those perspectives include \nbut are not limited to the following:  \n• The clean energy organizations, Fresh Energy, CGA, CEE and CEEM, all expressed \nsupport for the Acquisition and Settlement as critical to Minnesota Power’s ability to meet \nthe State’s Carbon Free Standard requirements. In their joint comments, Fresh Energy and \nCGA specifically recognized the enormous downside risk of rejecting the Acquisition, \nobserving that “there is significantly less risk to achieving Minnesota Power’s \nCommission -approved decarbonization plans, as well as setting a path to realizing the 1 00 \npercent standard, through approving the Settlement  versus the alternative.”13 CEE and \nCEEM similarly recognized the serious risk of the status quo while also stressing that the \nAcquisition , as conditioned by the Settlement , will “not affect the Commission’s authority , \nprocess or obligation to regulate Minnesota Power’s actions.”14 \n \n \n8 Comments from IUOE  Local 49 and North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters  (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket \nNo. 20258 -221733 -01); Corrected: Comments from IUOE  Local 49 and North Central States Regional Council of \nCarpenters (Aug. 5, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258 -221749 -01). \n9 LIUNA Comments on the Proposed Settlement  (Aug. 5, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258 -221753 -01) (“LIUNA \nComments ”). \n10 ECC  Comments  (Aug. 5, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258 -221751 -01); ECC  Exceptions  (Aug. 5, 2025) (eDocket No. \n20258 -221750 -01). \n11 Setting the Record Straight: The Case for ALLETE ’s Access to Capital and Clean Energy Leadership  (Aug. 5, 2025) \n(eDocket No. 20258 -221772 -01) (“Chambers of Commerce  Comments ”). \n12 Building Trades Comments  (Aug. 5, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258 -221752 -01). \n13 Joint Comments of Fresh Energy and CGA at 3  (eDocket No. 20258 -221738 -01) (emphasis added).  \n14 CEE and CEEM ’s Initial Comments  at 2 ( eDocket No. 20258 -221722 -01) (emphasis added).  \n \n4 • The Building Trades observed, based on their assessment , that “approval of the \n[Acquisition] will bring significant benefits to Minnesota Building Trades members” and \nthat “a decision to deny approval could have catastrophic consequences, destroying job \nopportunities on upcoming projects and forcing the utility to spend more money chasing \ncapital and less keeping rates affordable and service reliable.”15 \n \n• LIUNA’s comments provide a unique and incisive perspective from LIUNA’s direct \nexperience with GIP  specifically, and first -hand account of the Partners’ history as \nresponsible investors (ignored by the ALJ Report).16  \n \n• IBEW  Local 31, as “the exclusive representative for many of the skilled utility workers at \nMinnesota Power,” provided comments that provide a real -world account of the \nmeaningful value secured in the Settlement’s labor commitments, and explain that the \npresumed  labor risks associated with private equity transactions lack applicability in both \nthe regulated utility context and Minnesota’s distinct regulatory environment.17  \n \n• ECC’s comments provide a critical low -income consumer perspective on the importan ce \nof the arrearage forgiveness commitment that the ALJ Report and Opposing Parties so \ncavalierly dismissed.18 ECC ’s comments refer to  the Settlement as “a historic opportunity \nto extend arrearage forgiveness to non -income qualified customers at a crucial moment,” \nand emphasize the arrearage forgiveness commitment as “a unique opportunity to draw \ninvestment from shareholders, and not oth er customers in these vital programs.”19  \n \n• The Duluth, Grand Rapids, Hermantown, and Little Falls Chambers of Commerce provide \na critical perspective from the local businesses in the communities served by Minnesota \nPower. Their comments reflect an understanding that ALLETE’s capital investment plan \nis ultimately meaningless without access to new capital, which they conclude the \nAcquisition meaningfully provides to Minnesota Power.20 \n \nIn sum,  the commenters recommending approval of the Acquisition have thoroughly \nreviewed the Settlement in light of the possible risks presented in this proceeding , concluded that \nthe Settlement appropriately addresses those risks , and recommend approval of the Acquisition as \nconditioned by the Settlement . \n \n15 Building Trades Comments at 4  (eDocket No. 20258 -221752 -01). \n16 LIUNA Comments  at 4 (eDocket No. 20258 -221753 -01) (emphasis added).  \n17 IBEW Local 31 Exceptions  at 1–3 (eDocket No. 20258 -221748 -01). \n18 ECC Comments  at 5 (eDocket No. 20258 -221751 -01) (emphasis added).  \n19 Id. at 1–4. \n20 Chambers of Commerce Comments  at 2–3 (eDocket No.  20258 -221772 -01). \n \n5 III. THE ACQUISITION EXCEEDS THE PUBLIC INTEREST THRESHOLD \nREQUIRED BY MINNESOTA LAW AND CREATES SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS TO \nTHE PUBLIC INTEREST.  \nAs summarized throughout the Petition, Testimony, Briefs, and Exceptions filed by \nMinnesota Power in this proceeding, the Company faces an unprecedented need for capital to fund \ninvestments in regional transmission, renewable resources, and energy storage to support the \nregional shift in generating resources and Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard. These investments \nwill benefit customers for decades but will require substantial, unprecedented capital investment \nover the coming years.  \nOpposing Parties and commenters opposing the Acquisition continue to claim that the \nCompany does not need its stated access to capital. However, just because they say it is so, does \nnot make it so. The record shows that the Commission has approved investme nts by Minnesota \nPower of over $2.5 billion21 for generation and transmission projects that are needed for customers \nand scheduled to go in service by 2030 . Another $2.2 billion22 in projects are currently in some \nstage of permitting or cost recovery review before the Commission. These projects are all \n \n21 See In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power and Great River Energy for a Certificate of Need and \nRoute Permit for an Approximately 180 -mile, Double Circuit 345 - kV Transmission Line , Docket No s.

Importantly, many of these investments will be regionally cost -allocated \nand not paid for solely by Minnesota Power customers.  \nThe Acquisition and the commitments established in the Settlement target the most \nimportant areas for the public interest , and the areas of concern identified by the Department: \n(1) ensuring that Minnesota Power can finance the investments that customers need; (2)  ensuring \nthe financial health of the utility; (3)  protecting customers from any chance of rate impacts from \nthe Acquisition ; (4) ensuring that customers continue to receive high quality electric service; \n(5) facilitating the development of clean f irm technologies necessary for Carbon Free Standard  \ncompliance ; and (6)  ensuring that the Commission is able  to enforce the Settlement and effectively \nregulate Minnesota Power.  \nA. Ensuring Minnesota Power Can Finance the Investments Needed for the \nCarbon Free Standard  \nThe Acquisition and the Settlement ensure that Minnesota Power has the equity capital to \ninvest in projects that are needed to serve customers. As extensively documented in Petitioners’ \nTestimony, Briefs, and Exceptions, Minnesota Power must increase its level  of capital \ninvestments, and it would be unreasonably risky to rely on public markets to finance the capital \n \n7 for projects necessary to meet the Carbon Free Standard.23  The Acquisition will provide a more \nstable and reliable source of equity capital.24 \nThe Settlement further ensures that the Company will have the financing it needs, because \nthe Partners have committed that the new parent company, Alloy Parent, will provide  Minnesota \nPower the equity capital to finance the five -year capital plan, which includes approximately $3.3 \nbillion in investments for new transmission, new renewables, and new storage.25 To ensure that \nthe Commission can enforce this capital commitment, the Settlement provides that the new \ninvestors will not receive any dividends from the Company unless they have met the capital \ncommitment.26 These commitments  will allow the Company to focus on meeting the needs of \ncustomers and complying with the Carbon Free Standard.  \nB. Ensuring the Financial Health of the Utility  \nAs described below, the Settlement includes commitments that ensure the Acquisition will \nnot have a negative impact on the financial health of Minnesota Power to the detriment of \n \n23 The Opposing Parties cite economic theory to argue that the stock market is efficient and that “mispricing” events \nare “unlikely” to prevent a company from raising capital in the public markets. See Petitioners’ Exceptions at Att. E  \n(eDocket No. 20258 -221746 -02) (comparing Opposing Parties findings with the ALJ Report findings); LPI \nExceptions at 8  (eDocket No. 20258 -221740 -02).  This “ myopic focus on academic textbook views” is “not useful,” \nand actual history and the record evidence show the risks facing ALLETE are far from theoretical. Quackenbush \nRebuttal at 10 -11 (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -12). As explained in the testimony of Witness Quackenbush, despite \nthe “efficiency” of the market, in September 2008 Otter Tail turned to the public markets to raise capital and “fell \nshort by 35%” due to market volatility. Quackenbush Rebuttal at 15 -17 (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -12). Whether a \ntextbook would consider this “efficient,” a “mispricing” event, or some other academic label, the real -world effect \nwas that Otter Tail could not raise the capital it needed from the public market when it needed it. The risk is  even  \nmore acute for ALLETE because it will need to be a serial issuer that cannot strategically time issuances, and these \nserial issuances will be viewed skeptically by investors who see a small company trying to more than double its size \nin 5 years while faci ng customer concentration issues, recent customer contract terminations, tariffs, and other market \nheadwinds.  See, e.g. , Petitioners ’ Exceptions at 49 -52 (eDocket No. 20258 -221744 -02).  \n24 Opposing Parties argue the public markets are very large,  and therefore more capital is available in public markets. \nThis argument might sound compellingly simple, but it is flawed and not supported by either the record or reality. \nAgain, i t ignores what happened to Otter Tail in 2008 and is  further  contradicted by the testimony of experts with \nextensive, real -world experience trying to raise capital for infrastructure. See, e.g. , Petitioners’ Exceptions at 55 -56 \n(eDocket No. 20258 -221744 -02) (citing expert testimony of  Petitioner witnesses with extensive experience in utility \nfinance ). \n25 Settlement at 1.3 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n26 Settlement at 1.4 and 1.5  (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n \n8 customers . The primary measurement of the Company’s financial health is its credit rating  – the \nSettlement prohibits the new investors from receiving any dividends if the Company does not \nmaintain its investment grade credit rating.27  \nThe Settlement protects against excess debt by prohibiting any dividend distributions that \nwould cause the actual equity ratio of Minnesota Power to be outside the range approved by the \nCommission .28 It further protects the Company and its customers by prohibiting loans or pledges \nof Minnesota Power’s  assets without Commission approval.29 \nC. Protecting Customers From Rate Impacts  \nAs described in greater detail below, the Settlement commitments ensure that the \nAcquisition will not result in increased rates, because any costs related to or potentially caused by \nthe Acquisition will not be passed on to customers.30 The Acquisition will mitigate rate increase s \nin the future by eliminating cost items that are currently included in rates.31 The Settlement also \nensures that customers will receive near -term rate relief from a reduced return on equity (“ROE”) \nafter the Acquisition is closed,32 and that customers will not see an increase to base rates until at \nleast 2027 (despite significant loss of customer load and associated revenue in 2025).33 Further, \nthe Settlement accelerates the pace at which customers will receive refunds from land sales. This \n \n27 Settlement at 1.9 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (commercially reasonable efforts to maintain investment grade \ncredit rating) . \n28 Id.  \n29 Settlement at 1.18 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n30 Settlement at 1.12 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (customers held harmless from any cost of debt increase caused \nby the Acquisition for five years).  \n31 Settlement at  1.51 (no flotation costs), 1.52 (no investor relations costs), and 1.54 (no board compensation or \nexpenses for board members that are not independent)  (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n32 Settlement at 1.14 ( eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (ROE reduced from 9.78 percent to 9.65 percent).  \n33 Settlement at 1.43  (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (rate case stay -out until Nov. 1, 2026).  \n \n9 will mean an estimated return of $ 93.6 million34 to customers following approval of the \nAcquisition.35 \nCritically, the Settlement also ensures that the most financially vulnerable customers \nreceive additional protection, as the Partners will make an historic contribution to reduce \narrearages for low -income residential customers  which currently total $3.5 million .36 \nD. Ensuring Customers Receive High Quality Electric Service  \nThe Settlement includes an extensive set of service quality performance requirements for \nMinnesota Power  and substantial financial penalties to enforce those requirements.37 Currently \nthere are no specific service quality requirements or penalties for not achieving the same that are \napplicable to Minnesota Power. Approving the Settlement would establish service quality \nrequirements that do not currently exist and back them up with penalties the Commission would \nlikely not have the authority to impose.  \nE. Facilitating Clean Firm Technology Development for Carbon Free Standard  \nCompliance  \nCompliance with the Carbon Free Standard  will be further supported by the Settlement \ncondition whereby the Partners  will contribute $50 million in non -recoverable investment into a \nClean Firm Technology Fund.38 A nonrecoverable capital infusion of this kind is unprecedented \nin Minnesota , and  likely not replicated elsewhere. Achieving full compliance with the Carbon Free \nStandard  will require deployment of clean firm technologies that are in the early stages of \n \n34 In the Matter of the Petition by Minnesota Power for Approval of Land Sales , Docket No.  E015/PA -20-675, \nCompliance Filing  (Oct. 15, 2024 ) (eDocket No. 202410 -211008 -01). \n35 Settlement at 1.46 ( eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (land sale refund plan filed within 60 days of closing).  \n36 Settlement at 1.48 ( eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (contribution to reduce residential arrearages) ; Joint Proposed \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation to Approve the Acquisition at n.392  (May 29,  2025)  \n(eDocket No. 20255 -219382 -02). \n37 Settlement at 1.64 ( eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (service quality performance and financial penalties).  \n38 Settlement at 1.63 ( eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (Clean Firm Technology Fund).  \n \n10 development. A capital infusion such as the one in this commitment will contribute significantly \nto Minnesota Power’s ability to help drive the development of these new technologies.  \nF. Ensuring the Commission can Enforce the Settlement and Effectively Regulate \nMinnesota Power  \nAs described in more detail below, the Settlement includes commitments that ensure the \nCommission can enforce the Settlement – including all of the commitments made by the Partners \nor the new parent company, Alloy Parent – and continue to effectively regul ate Minnesota Power. \nThese commitments ensure that the Commission will have access to the information it needs,39 \nand have the regulatory authority to make sure that all of the commitments in the Settlement are \nsatisfied.40 \nThese commitments ensure that the Acquisition is consistent with the public interest and \nprovide substantial benefit to Minnesota Power’s customers. All these Settlement commitments \nare additive to the benefits of the Acquisition as presented at the time o f the evidentiary hearing. \nAs such, the Settlement presents many additional, tangible benefits to customers, underscoring \nthat it is in the public interest.  \nThe Opposing Parties try to minimize these commitments by arguing they are needed only \nbecause the Acquisition itself creates some harm. That is incorrect. Only one of these commitments \n– the commitment not to seek recovery of transaction/transition costs – is a protection against a \nrisk actually associated with the Acquisition, as certainly there are costs associated with pursuing \nand completing the Acquisition (which neither the Company nor the Partners are asking customers \nto bear).  \n \n39 Settlement at 1.7 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01) (compliance filings on equity infusions and dividends) .  \n40 Settlement at 1.8 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01).  \n \n11 None of these commitments would be available to Minnesota Power’s customers if the \nAcquisition is not approved. Minnesota Power is not able to make such commitments without the \nAcquisition, as so much would depend on its ability to obtain capital in public  markets. Existing \nand future public shareholders would never make these commitments to Minnesota Power’s \ncustomers; nor would the Commission have the ability to force shareholders into such \ncommitments. They are only possible because of the Acquisition, t he Partners, and the Settlement \nwith the Department.   \nThe next segments of this Reply turn to areas of concern on which Opposing Parties \nfocused their Exceptions and Comments on the Settlement.  \nIV. THE ACQUISITION  AND SETTLEMENT WILL PROVIDE RATE SAVINGS \nFOR MINNESOTA POWER CUSTOMERS . \nThe Opposing Parties argue  that the Settlement fails to resolve their claims  that the \nAcquisition will lead to increased rates.  Three fundamental facts refute these claims:  \n1. The Acquisition itself does not cause any costs or investments that might result in rate \nincreases . It simply ensure s Minnesota Power has reliable, cost -effective access to the \nequity capital  it needs to meet its public interest obligations, including compliance with \nthe Carbon  Free Standard;  \n \n2. The Acquisition will not alter the Commission’s regulatory authority over Minnesota \nPower, which means the Commission will continue to determine (a) Minnesota \nPower’s investment levels in future resource dockets, and (b) Minnesota Power’s rates \nand authori zed returns in future rate cases; and  \n \n3. The Settlement includes commitments  that will cause rates to be lower  than they would \nbe without the Acquisition.   \nAs a result, the Commission should reject unfounded claims that the Acquisition would lead to \nincreased rates, much less excessive rate increases.  Rather, the Commission should recognize that \nits ongoing authority, along with the added support from the Settlement, will fully protect \nMinnesota Power customers from any unreasonable rate increases.   \n \n12 A. The Acquisition will not Increase  Rate s.  \nThe Office of the Attorney General – Residential Utilities Division (“ OAG ”) continues to \nclaim an Acquisition -related risk of rate increases that would “greatly exceed projected inflation”  \nand that the Settlement does not sufficiently mitigate this risk.41 This claim has no credible \nevidentiary or logical basis , is not consistent with what has happened in other utility purchases by \nprivate investors , is based  on a misunderstanding of Partner documents , and is also based on either \nfundamental opposition to or wishful thinking about the scale of necessary investments to comply \nwith the Carbon Free Standard . \nAs discussed in the Petitioners’  Briefs and Exceptions, Minnesota Power’s rates can only \nreflect  its prudent operational costs and investments  as approved by the Commission , including \nthe authorized return on investments. The OAG inaccurately  asserts  that the Acquisition will cause  \nadditional operational costs or capital investments. There is nothing in the  record to support  that \nassertion.  Minnesota Power will continue to incur costs and propose investments to meet its service \nobligations reliably and affo rdably while also meeting its other public interest requirements , \nincluding  Carbon Free Standard  compliance. Importantly , those  investments will be tied to \nCommission -approved Integrated Resource and Distribution Plans , Certificates of Need, and other \nproceedings,  and any proposed rate increases will be subject to Commission approval in cases in \nwhich Minnesota Power will continue to have the burden of proof.  The Acquisition will simply \nensure that Minnesota Power has the equity capital available when needed to meet those \nobligations.  \n \n41 Comments of the OAG  on the Stipulation Between the Department and Petitioners  at 5 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket \nNo. 20258 -221723 -02) (“OAG Comments ”). \n \n13 The OAG  also claim s that the Acquisition will put upward pressure on rates because of \nwhat the OAG provocatively characterizes  as a “plan to seek outsized returns.”42 This claim is \ninaccurate in numerous respects. First, neither the returns nor any rate assumptions made in \nanalyzing the Acquisition are part of a “plan.”43 They are assumed inputs to and projections from \na financial model . The financial model is  based on multiple inputs , including capital forecasts. \nThose forecasts were based on Minnesota Power’s capital plan  – not a Partner capital plan – and \nare needed to help meet the Carbon Free Standard . Those investments will be subject to ongoing \nCommission review and approval.   \nSecond,  the OAG’s argument is misplaced because it fails to reflect  that the Commission \nsets Minnesota Power’s authorized ROE ; it is not based on the plans or preferences of investors.  \nThere is no basis to believe that the Commission will stop carefully scrutinizing Minnesota \nPower’s investment levels and rates.  \nThird, the OAG’s claim, and all opposing parties’ claims regarding the Partners’ purported \n“excessive returns,” conflate two different concepts: total returns  on the Partners’ entire investment \nin ALLETE , which are the focus of the documents that the OAG cites, with Minnesota Power’s \nauthorized ROE. The Partners’ total return on their investment in ALLETE will be primarily driven \nby an increase in the value of the Company, not a change in ROE. The value of the Company is \nexpected to increase in the future through investments in the energy transition that will make \nMinnesota Power more valuable over time . Importantly, some of the investments that will increase \n \n42 OAG Comments at 5  (eDocket No. 20258 -221723 -02).   \n43 As explained numerous times in the proceeding and on exceptions, documents like investment committee \nmemoranda evaluate potential scenarios to help decision -makers understand investment risks and, in order to do so, \nmust rely on certain assumptions that are described in the memoranda, but the assumptions are not statements of \nintention or definitive plans to be implemented in the future . There can be no such “plans” because the subjects of the \nassumptions require future contested proceedings where they will be determined by the Commission. See, e.g. , \nPetitioners’ Exceptions at 31, n.114  (eDocket No. 20258 -221744 -02). \n \n14 the value of the Company – such as certain  transmission lines – will not have a one -to-one impact \non Minnesota Power  rates, because much of this cost will be socialized across the MISO system.  \nFourth , the OAG and other Opposing Parties ignore the record evidence demonstrating that \nthe Partners’ financial models  assumed no increase  in Minnesota Power’s ROE , but instead \nassumed  Minnesota Power’s  previously  approved  ROE  levels  would remain unchanged .44 While \nROEs will change in the future based on market conditions , the record is clear that  the Partners  are \nnot making their investment based on any expectation of significant increases or changes in \nMinnesota Power’s  ROE . Further, the Partners (like any investors) recognize that they may not \nachieve the returns estimated in their financial models.45 The Partners, not customers, bear the risk \nthat their actual returns may be lower than the returns estimated in their investment models. As \nfurther explained below, the Partners cannot unilaterally  increase authorized ROEs or Minnesota \nPower’s customer rates to force a higher investment return as feared by opposing parties; in fact, \nany effort to do so could adversely affect the long -term value of the Partners’ investment, incur \nthe Commission’s ire, and undermine  their reputations as investors in regulated infrastructure.  \nFifth , the record demonstrates that other utilities purchased by private investors have not \nexperienced  dramatic or unusual increases in their rates. To the contrary, as shown in Table 1 \nbelow , the rates of five major investor -owned electric utilities that have been acquired by  financial \ninvestors since 2007, including an investment by CPP Investments, had average  Compound \nAnnual Growth Rate s (“CAGR”) that were lower than the average increases in the state where \neach utility is located and below  national in vestor -owned utility averages over the same time \nperiod:  \n \n44 Ex. CURE -602 Schedule JB -9 at 23 (Baker Surrebuttal)  (eDocket No. 20253 -216818 -07) (HCTS) ; Ex. CURE -602, \nSchedule JB -8 at 5 (Baker Surrebuttal)  (eDocket No. 20253 -216818 -06) (HCTS) . \n45 Ex. MP -31 at 29 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -09); Ex. CPPIB -GIP-206 at 5 (Bram Response) \n(eDocket No.  20254 -217895 -02). \n \n15 Table 1. Energy Information Administration Retail Rates  \n \nNonetheless, t he Opposing Parties continue to ignore these multiple examples and focus \non the single outlier  case of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula Power Company  (“UPPCO ”). However, \nas explained by Petitioner Witness Quackenbush, who presided over the UPPCO cases as the chair \nof the Michigan Public Service Commission , UPPCO is a poor comparison because its rate issues \nexisted prior to the acquisition and were primarily related to its very small size and rural service \nterritory.46 Opposing Parties, and the ALJ Report, continue to ignore these facts, as they run \ncounter to their narrative . \n \n46 See Ex. MP -30 at 27 (Quackenbush Rebuttal ) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -12). \n\n \n16 B. The Commission’s Continued Authority and Careful Scrutiny of Minnesota \nPower’s Investment Levels and Rates Further Protect Customers . \nOpposing Parties  continue to criticize the Settlement because it does not foreclose a future  \nROE that may be higher than the Company’s current ROE . For example, Sierra Club complains \nthat the Settlement “ will not prevent the Company from seeking an ROE increase in that case or \nlimit the size of that increase.”47 CURE similarly complains that “adjusting Minnesota Power’s \ninflated ROE marginally lower for one year does nothing to protect customers from higher ROE \nvalues in future rate cases.”48 CURE further recommends “limiting the utility’s ROE to 6 percent \nfor the entire period that Minnesota Power is owned by the Partners.”49  \nThese complaints by Sierra Club and CURE are wholly unreasonable and  lay bare their \ncategorical opposition to any private utility ownership . They further underscore the extreme nature \nof the se entities’  opposition to the Acquisition . It is not reasonable to  suggest only a permanently \n(and drastically) lower ROE could justify approval of the Acquisition , particularly  given  \nMinnesota Power’s long -standing, well -known risks as a utility company due to its  size and \ncustomer profile . More fundamentally, Sierra C lub and CURE’s position ignores that there  is no \nquestion the Commission will ultimately decide the Company’s authorized ROE after the \nAcquisition just as it would if there were no Acquisition.  The only difference in the future ROE \ndeterminations  is that customers will be far better off from a rate perspective because of the \nimmediate benefits of the Settlement, including lower ROE, one -year rate -case stay out, and \narrearage relief , coupled with long -term customer savings in the form of no flotation costs, no \n \n47 Sierra Club Comments in Opposition to Proposed Settlement at 8–9 (Aug. 4, 2025) (eDocket No. 20258 -221736 -\n03) (“Sierra Club Comments ”). \n48 CURE Initial Comments at 3 (Aug. 4, 2025)  (eDocket No. 20258 -221739 -02) (“CURE Comments ”). \n49 Id. at 5.   \n \n17 investor relations expenses, reduced Board of Directors’ expenses, and investor  funding of clean \ntechnology investments for which customers would otherwise have to pay.   \nC. Commitments in the Settlement Provide Substantial Rate Benefits that would \nnot be Available Without the Acquisition and Settlement.   \nContrary to the positions taken by Opposing Parties, the following commitments in the \nSettlement cumulatively provide substantial direct rate benefits to customers that would not be \navailable without the Acquisition and Settlement.  \n• One-Year Rate -Case Stay  Out: This additional commitment protects customers from \nwhat could be significant rate increases attributable in part to the loss of revenue from the \nidling of mining operations. The Department valued this commitment conservatively at \n$25 million, but the Depar tment also noted that interim rates from the last four Minnesota \nPower rate cases were “ sizeable” – $34.6 million (2016 rate case), $36.1 million (2019 rate \ncase), $87.3 million (2021 rate case) and $102.6 million (2023 rate ca se). \n \n• ROE Reduction : This additional commitment will reduce the ROE from the currently \nauthorized 9.78 percent to 9.65 percent, which will reduce rates paid by customers by $5.5 \nmillion over the next two years . \n \n• Arrearage Forgiveness:  This commitment will reduce accumulated customer  arrearages \nby approximately $3.5 million  to pre -COVID  levels . \n \n• Flotation Cost Recovery : This commitment will exclude flotation costs from possible \nrecovery in all future rate cases, an adjustment which is included in the ROE Reduction \nestimate above for the first several years but which will continue in the future.  In the future, \nthis will likely reduce customer rates by approximately $3.7 million per year.  \n \n• Board Member Compensation:  This commitment will preclude recovery through rates \nof any compensation paid to members of the post -Acquisition Board of Directors  that are \nnot independent from the Partners , which will likely reduce customer rates by \napproximately  $700,000 per year . \n \n• Investor Relations Costs:  This commitment will preclude recovery from ratepayers of \nany investor -relations costs, which will likely reduce rates customers pay by approximately  \n$155,000 per year . \n \nContrary to  Opposing Parties’ unsupported fears of rate increases, reductions in ROE, \narrearage forgiveness, and forgone flotation cost recovery, Board of Directors’  compensation, and \ninvestor relations expenses are all concrete commitments that affirmatively reduce rates for \n \n18 Minnesota Power customers  now and relative to what rates would be in the future absent the \nAcquisition . None of  these financial benefits would be available to Minnesota Power customers \nwithout the Acquisition , as conditioned by the Settlement.  As shown in the Petitioners’ Exceptions  \nand Attachment B thereto (Joint Redline of Section III.C  of the ALJ Report) , the financial benefits \nincluded in the Settlement exceed those of the other “take -private” transactions cited in the ALJ \nReport. The financial benefits in the Settlement total $685  per customer,  as compared to $38 in \nPuget Sound , $179 in El Paso , and $147 in South Jersey .50   \nThese rate benefits are particularly compelling when viewed in relation to the \nCommission’s approval of the merger between Integrys (the former parent company of Minnesota \nEnergy Resources Corporation) and Wisconsin Energy Corporation  (“WEC”) .51 Similar to the \nAcquisition in this case, the transaction in the WEC/ Integrys case was premised on improving \naccess to capital . Critically,  the Commission approved the WEC/ Integrys  transaction  without \nrequiring  any affirmative customer financial benefits saying:  \nMERC has argued persuasively that the goal of the merger is not to achieve \nimmediate synergies but rather to better position the merged companies to access \ncapital and invest in infrastructure and customer -service improvements . … Under \nthese circumstances, the public interest does not require that MERC demonstrate \nany particular level of savings as a result of the merger.52 \n \nThe substantial rate benefits included in the Settlement are all the more significant because \nthe Commission found that savings to customers were not required under the access to capital \ndrivers of the WEC/ Integrys transaction , and because the gas utility in that case needed far less \ninvestment capital than Minnesota Power requires in this instance.  In combination, the Acquisition \n \n50 Petitioners ’ Exceptions at 70, Figure 2  (eDocket No. 20258 -221744 -02); Petitioners’ Exceptions , Attachment C at  \n1 (eDocket No. 20258 -221744 -06). \n51 In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Merger Agreement between Integrys Energy Group, Inc. and \nWisconsin Energy Corporation , Docket No. G011/PA -14-664, ORDER APPROVING MERGER SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS  \n(June 2 5, 2015)   (eDocket No. 20156 -111752 -01). \n52 Id. at 8 (emphasis added).  \n \n19 and the Settlement provide substantial net rate  benefits to customers that would not be available \notherwise . \nV. THE  SETTLEMENT  WILL BE FULLY ENFORCEABLE BY THE \nCOMMISSION . \nSeveral Parties filed Exceptions or Comments suggesting that provisions of the Settlement \nare not enforceable.53 That is not correct. The Settlement is enforceable in a variety of ways , most \nof which have been glossed over by the  Opposing Parties . \nA. The Commission Can Enforce the Settlement Because it will be  Included in a \nCommission Order.  \nPetitioners have repeatedly confirmed agreement  that any Commission order approving the \nSettlement will incorporate the commitments made in this proceeding, including in the Settlement . \nAs such,  the Commission will have authority to enforce every provision just as  all Commission \norders are enforceable.54  \n1. The Commission’s authority to enforce its orders is expressly stated in \nstatute  and is recognized by the Petitioners . \nThe Commission’s authority to enforce the requirements of its orders is clearly set forth in \nMinnesota law . Specifically, Minn. Stat. § 216B.54 provides that any time the Commission or the \nDepartment believes a “person” has violated or is about to violate a Commission order, the \nCommission or Department can refer the matter to the Attorney General “who shall take \nappropriate legal action .” This authority is very broad, applying to “any person”  and to any acts \nor omissions  that are contrary to any Commission  order, including acts or omissions  that have not \noccurred but are about to occur.55 Importantly, a “person” include s partnerships and corporations,56 \n \n53 See Initial Comments of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota at 18 (eDocket No.  \n20258 -221742 -03) (“CUB Comments”) ; Initial Comment of LPI ( Aug. 5, 2025 ) (eDocket No. 20258 -221758 -01) \n(describing Settlement as “simply more statements” ). \n54 Partner Initial Post -Hearing Brief at 107–08 (May 1, 2025) (eDocket No. 20255 -218522 -01). \n55 Minn. Stat. § 216B.02, subd. 3  (emphasis added) . \n56 Id. \n \n20 which means the Commission’s enforcement authority extends to the Partners and Alloy Parent as \nwell as Minnesota Power. Minnesota statutes further  require  the Attorney General to take \n“appropriate legal action,” without limitation , specifically including authority to seek penalties \nunder Minn. Stat. § 216B.57.  On top of this, t he authority to take “appropriate legal action” \nincludes the authority to seek injunctive relief.  \nTo provide further certainty about the enforceability of the Settlement, the Petitioners and \nthe Department negotiated Commitment 1.73, which  provides as follows:  \nALLETE and Partners agree that any failure to achieve any commitment in this \nSettlem ent, or to comply with any other condition the Commission places on \napproval of the Acquisition, is a violation of the Commission’s order under Minn. \nStat. § 216B.54 and is enforceable against the entity from whom the action (or non -\naction) is required.  \n \nThis Commitment  demonstrates a common and binding understanding that every commitment in \nthe Settlement will be enforceable  against the entity to which that commitment applies, which \nincludes  ALLETE, the Partners , and Alloy Parent depending on the specific commitment.   \nTo provide even more certainty and clarity regarding the Settlement’s enforceability, \nCommitment 1.74 provides that the Partners and Alloy Parent are submitting to the jurisdiction of \nthe Commission and Minnesota courts:  \nALLETE  and Partners  submit  to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and then of \nthe courts of the State of Minnesota with respect to any action brought to enforce \nor resolve a dispute arising from an applicable commitment set forth in this \nSettlement or a Commission Order adopting this Settlement.   \n \nPetitioning parties’ consent to the jurisdiction of the Commission is consistent with the \nCommission’s longtime practice, including when approving utility mergers under Minn. Stat. \n§ 216B.50.57  \n \n57 See In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Merger Agreement between Integrys Energy Group, Inc. and \nWisconsin Energy Corporation , Docket No. G-011/PA -14-664, ORDER FINDING JURISDICTION , GRANTING VARIANCE , \nAND ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES  at 2 (Feb. 24, 2015) (eDocket No. 20152 -107615 -01).  \n \n21 Opposing Parties continue their effort to cast doubt on this enforcement authority by \nignoring the unambiguous language in both the Commission’s enforcement statutes and the \nSettlement. The law is clear that Commission orders are enforceable against the Pa rtners and Alloy \nParent. The additional commitment s in the Settlement confirm the Petitioners (including the \nPartners and Alloy Parent) have specifically agreed  in writing that the Settlement will be \nenforceable by the Commission  and the appropriate courts  in Minnesota.  \n2. Opposing Parties’ cited c ases underscore  that Commission Orders are \nenforceable against persons who consent to be boun d. \nOpposing Parties also assert that , regardless of any commitment , the Settlement cannot \nconfer jurisdiction over the Partners or Alloy Parent to the Commission.  This assertion is wrong \nand is based on the Opposing Parties’ mischaracterization of the court cases they cite.   \nOpposing Parties cite several court cases, including No Power Line, Inc. v. Minn. \nEnvironmental Quality Council58 to suggest that “the Commission cannot accept jurisdiction over \nentities or matters where the legislature has not granted it express authority.”59 But this is not what \nthe cited cases actually say.  To the contrary, those cases say that the Commission cannot obtain \n“subject matter” jurisdiction over things that are not expressly within its authority.  These cases \nactually  confirm that the Commission has personal jurisdiction over entities  that consent to that \njurisdiction  (as the Petitioners have done here) even if the Commission would not otherwise have \nthat “personal jurisdiction.”   \n \n58 262 N.W.2d 312 (Minn. 1977).  \n59 CUB Comments at 13 ( eDocket No. 20258 -221742 -03) (citing  ALJ Report at 65 ) (“See No Power Line, Inc. v. \nMinn. Env't Quality Council, 262 N.W.2d 312, 321 (Minn. 1977) (subject -matter  jurisdiction may not be granted to \nan agency by consent of the parties); cf. Centra Homes, LLC v .

Woolley, 659 N.W.2d 300, 306 (Minn. Ct. App.2003) (same). ”). To be clear, these parentheticals are the \ncharacterizations of the ALJ Report but they are not correct.  \n \n22 Subject -matter jurisdiction is not the issue here, but personal jurisdiction is. There is no \ndispute that the Commission has subject -matter jurisdiction over approvals and conditions of \nutility transactions and mergers pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 216B.50. The dispute  Opposing Parties \nraise  is whether the Commission has authority  over Alloy Parent and the Partners  – i.e., personal \njurisdiction . No Power Line, Inc.  is clear that the Commission  does have that authority . In that \ncase, the Minnesota Supreme Court made clear that personal jurisdiction can be conferred by the \nconsent of the parties .60 In fact, contrary to the claims of Opposing Parties and the ALJ Report,  \n“[o]ne of the oldest tenets of personal jurisdiction is that a defendant may voluntarily submit to the \njurisdiction of a court.”61 This is essentially the opposite of what Opposing Parties and the ALJ \nReport claim.  \nHere, t he Partners and Alloy Parent have consented to the jurisdiction of the Commission \nas provided by the specific commitments in the Settlement , and as repeatedly reinforced by \ntestimony and briefs in this proceeding .62 The Commission clearly has the authority to enforce the \nprovisions of the Settlement in the same way it can enforce all its orders.63 \n \n60 No Power Line , 262 N.W.2d  at 321 (“The distinction is an important on e because subject -matter, unlike personal, \njurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent of the parties.”).  \n61 Rykoff -Sexton, Inc. v.

The Commission will have Effective Mechanisms to Enforce the Settlement , as \nwith any Other Commission Order.   \nOpposing Parties and the ALJ Report seem to suggest that the Commission’s enforcement \nauthority under Minnesota law , even as described above,  is not strong enough to be meaningful in \nthis proceeding. That suggestion is incorrect for several reasons. First, the Commission will have \nthe same authority to enforce its orders against Minnesota Power, Alloy Parent, and the Partners \nthat it has against everyone else, including Minnesota’s other public utilities.  \nSecond, the Commission’s statutory enforcement authority has served the State well for \nmany years , including against large companies, holding companies, and newcomers to the State . \nThis authority has been  sufficient to ensure just and reasonable rates, quality customer service , \ncompliance with applicable laws,  and compliance with the Commission’s rules and order s – \nincluding against public utilities and the entities that own them , as applicable, such as Northern \nStates Power Company, CenterPoint Energy, Min nesota Energy Resources Corporation, Otter Tail \nPower, and their parent companies .64  \n Third , Commission enforcement actions carry substantial weight beyond the direct impacts \nof the specific remedies or penalties imposed by a Court. Public utilities operate in the public \nspotlight under the Commission’s regulatory authority; therefore, any violat ion of a Commission \norder will be widely reported and pose a serious risk to the reputation of the entity against whom \nthe violation was found. Minnesota Power will continue to be  a public utility subject to \nCommission jurisdiction , and the quality and value of the company depends on its good \nrelationship and standing with the Commission that regulates it.  \n \n64 See Minn. Stat. § 216B.54 ; see, e.g. , In the Matter of an Investigation and Audit of Northern States Power \nCompany’s Service Quality Reporting , Docket No.  E,G-002/CI -02-2034 , In the Matter of the Petition of Northern \nStates Power Company d/b/a Xcel Energy for Approval of Amendments to its Natural Gas and Electric Service Quality \nTariffs , Docket No. E,G-002/M -12-383, ORDER ON DISTRIBUTION OF UNDERPERFORMANCE PENALTY  (Oct. 9, 2024 ) \n(eDocket No.  202410 -210844 -01) (enforcing the commitment of the Xcel Energy merger ). \n \n24 Fourth , the Partners ’ businesses are premised on the ability to make investments in \ninfrastructure, including regulated infrastructure . As such, the reputational risk of a material non -\ncompliance issue or lawsuit  is very significant – well beyond the actual dollar figure of any fines \nor penalties. Compliance problems also would affect the value of the Partners’ investment in \nALLETE, magnifying financial consequences to the Partners.   \nFifth, in addition to the long -run financial and reputational incentives to protect the \ninvestment in ALLETE, the Partners have also committed to immediate financial penalties for \nnon-compliance. If Alloy Parent is not in compliance with the capital commit ment, the Petitioners \nhave committed that ALLETE will not provide any dividends to Alloy Parent.65 This provision is \nclearly enforceable, as the acting part y in a payment of dividends is ALLETE, over which the \nCommission undisputably has jurisdiction. Dividends are the only way that the Partners can obtain \nreturns from ALLETE short of a sale. Agreeing to limitations on their ability to obtain dividends \nis an incredibly significant concessi on that demonstrates the Partners’ commitment to responsible \ninvestment in ALLETE and Minnesota Power.  \nOpposing Parties appear to have a confused understanding of dividends that causes them \nto undervalue the significance of dividend -related commitments in the Settlement. The OAG \nappears to argue that dividends from ALLETE are not capital infusions from the Partners, and that \ncommitting to provide equity or else forfeit the ability to take dividends means the Partners would \nnot have “any skin in the game.”66 This is fundamentally incorrect. Under the current public \nownership, dividends are distributed to stockholders , are expected by public shareholders each \nquarter,  and are not available for re -investment.67 The Partners have the ability to forgo those \n \n65 Settlement at 1.4 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n66 OAG Comments at 17  (eDocket No . 20258 -221723 -02). \n67 Ex. MP -28 at 20 (Scissions Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -04); Ex. MP -29 at 7 –8 (Taran Rebuttal) (eDocket \nNo. 20253 -216055 -05); Ex. MP -30 at 20 (Quackenbush Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -12).  \n \n25 dividends, effectively taking capital that they would have otherwise received and reinvesting that \nas equity into ALLETE. The reason the dividend -related commitments are effective enforcement \nmechanisms is that , along with the billions of dollars the Partners already will have invested in \nALLETE,  the dividends are the “skin in the game” that the OAG want s to see. As  also explained \nabove, the Partners know that they must assure compliance with the Settlement for numerous \nreasons regardless of which entity ha s committed to take specific actions. Otherwise, they receive \ndelayed or no returns on their investment.  \nFinally,  there is no evidence in this record that the Partners have any intention or incentive \nto not comply with Commission orders.  While it is appropriate for regulatory bodies to take \nreasonable actions  to ensure commitments are enforceable and the Commission’s directives will \nbe followed  (and this is why the Petitioners have reinforced their role vis -à-vis the Commission) , \nit is not appropriate to simply reiterate  inflammato ry claims or write off meaningful commitments \nwithout balanced evaluation.  The Partners have been successful investors in large part because of \ntheir integrity, which was also a key factor in ALLETE’s  own analysis  of the Part ners and further \ndemonstrated by LIUNA’s experience with GIP .68 Further evidence that the Partners will be \nresponsible investors is described in Section VI, below.  \nMoreover, Opposing Parties fail to take into account that an investor in the public market \ncould, absent the Acquisition, buy large quantities of ALLETE stock and make changes without \nany obligations to the Commission whatsoever. While Opposing Parties con tinually seek more \nenforceability against the Partners, it is undisputable that the Commission will have far more \nenforcement authority over the Partners than against current investors – including potential \ninvestors who could use public markets to acquire  a controlling stake in the Company.  \n \n68 See LIUNA Comments at 3  (eDocket No. 20258 -221753 -01); Ex. MP -1 Attachment L at 55 -59 (Initial Petition) \n(eDocket No. 20247 -208768 -01).  \n \n26 C. The Commission has Additional A uthority to Ensure the Partners and Alloy \nParent Comply with the Settlement.  \nIn addition to its primary enforcement authority, the Commission has many other tools to \nensure compliance with the Settlement. First, the Commission has strong enforcement authority \nrelated to the Carbon Free Standard . If a utility does not comply with the Commission’s orders \npursuant to the Carbon Free Standard , the Commission can “order the electric utility to construct \nfacilities” or take other actions to get into compliance.69 If the utility fails to do so, the Commission \n“may impose a financial penalty . . . in an amount not to exceed the estimated cost . . . to achieve \ncompliance.”70 Given that these compliance actions could involve the construction of power \nplants, the potential penalties for non -compliance are extremely high. Any penalties assessed \nagainst Minnesota Power would also harm Alloy Parent and the investment made by the Partners \nin Alloy Parent, because it would harm the overall value of the utility and directly affect the \nreputations of the Partners as investors in the utility.  \nSecond, the Commission has the authority to set rates – including the ROE – for Minnesota \nPower  and its customers , which will have a direct financial impact on Alloy Parent and the \nPartners.71 Partners understand that if they do not comply with the provisions of the Settlement, \nthe Commission could take a negative view of the ROE in Minnesota Power’s next rate case, which  \ncould have a negative financial impact on Alloy Parent and the Partners.  Minnesota Power makes \nup the vast majority of ALLETE, and as a result represents the vast majority of the Partners’ \ninvestment value in ALLETE. Regulatory decisions that impact the profitability of Minnesota \nPower will have an impact on the success, or lac k-thereof, of the Partners’ investment in ALLETE. \nAs explained in the Partners’ Initial Brief, “The Partners fully recognize that they must follow \n \n69 Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 7.  \n70 Id. \n71 Minn. Stat. § 216B.16.  \n \n27 through on the commitments made in this proceeding, and that failing to do so could impact the \nmany other decisions the Commission makes related to Minnesota Power.”72  \nThird, the Commission has supplemental enforcement authority to assure compliance with \nthe Settlement because it must approve the timing, entity, and conditions of any future sale of the \nPartners’ interest in ALLETE under Minn . Stat. § 216B.50. As explained in the Partners’ Initial \nBrief, they intend to earn their overall  return on their investment primarily  by helping Minnesota \nPower make the investments needed to meet its public interest obligations to the State and its \ncustomers, which will increase the value of the Company over time.73 The Partners will benefit \nfrom the increased value of ALLETE if it is sold in the future – and that sale will have to be \napproved by the Commission. It is in neither the Company’s nor the Partners’ interest  for \nMinnesota Power , the Partners, or Alloy Parent to violate  (whether intentionally or \nunintentionally)  any of the commitments in the Settlement , as Opposing Parties seem to suggest.  \nRather,  the Partners need  the support and approval of the Commission both to obtain reasonable \nreturns and to sell any part of their investment in the future.   \nD. The Settlement is Enforceable Against the Right Entities  and Persons . \nThe ALJ Report and Opposing Parties also seem concerned that the Settlement is not \nenforceable against the right entities. Opposing Parties focus in particular on Commitment  1.3, \nwhich  states that “Alloy Parent shall provide to Minnesota Power equity financing . . . in an amount  \nat least  equal to the equity financing required to fund Minnesota Power’s 5 -year capital investment \nplan.”74 Opposing Parties appear to question this extraordinary commitment in several respects, \nall of which are invalid.  \n \n72 Partner Initial Post-Hearing  Brief at 109  (eDocket No. 20255 -218522 -01). \n73 Id. at 83–84. \n74 Settlement at 1.3 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n \n28 First, Opposing Parties assert that the commitment is not meaningful because it is made on \nbehalf of Alloy Parent, rather than the Partners. This assertion is misplaced. Alloy Parent is the \nproper entity to make a capital commitment because Alloy Parent is  the entity that will actually \nown ALLETE  and that will make  equity investments  in ALLETE . Moreover, the record is clear \nthat some of the equity capital to be provided to ALLETE may come from deferred dividends , \nwhich would otherwise be paid to  Alloy Paren t. Accordingly , pursuant to the Settlement , Alloy \nParent is the entity that would be prohibited from receiv ing dividends if the capital commitment \nwere violated in some manner , effectively forcing equity capital  to be provided by Alloy Parent .  \nThese deferred dividends, whether compelled  through this commitment  or made through deferral \nby a patient investor as the Partners intend, have the same dollar value to a company as obtaining \nan infusion of equity from another source.  Or, put another way, Alloy  Parent is the  entity entitled \nto dividends and is also the entity that actually has the capability to defer the dividends, again \nconfirming that it is the appropriate entity to provi de the capital commitment.  \nSecond, and perhaps key to the ir whole enforceability argument, some opposing  parties \nclaim that the Partners could flout the capital commitment by simply  “abandon ing” Alloy Parent \nas if it were a meaningless entity .75 That is simply  not a realistic possibility. The Partners are \ninvesting $3.9 billion to become the owners of ALLETE and they are making  that investment \nthrough Alloy Parent; they cannot just “walk away” from their multi -billion -dollar investment.  \nFurther, the Partners have each provided sworn  testimony that Alloy Parent will provide the capital \nALLETE needs.76 Their reputations as investors are on the line, which will follow them far into \nthe future in many other transactions as large or larger than ALLETE. Their  reputations as stewards \n \n75 OAG Comments at 14 (eDocket No 20258 -221723 -02). \n76 See Ex. MP -13 at 13 (Alley Direct) (eDocket No. 202412 -212968 -10); Ex. MP -14 at 23–24 (Bram Direct) (eDocket \nNo. 202412 -212968 -09); Ex. MP -32 at 6 (Alley Rebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -09); Ex. MP -32 at 6 (Bram \nRebuttal) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -08).  \n \n29 of their own investors’ capital also are on the line and could be irrecoverably tarnished by such a \nploy. By any objective measure, t he Partners  have enormously strong financial and reputational \nincentives to follow through, in addition to the direct financial consequences.  Opposing Parties’ \ndetermination to continue pressing their arguments on this point underscores the ir excessively \ncynical , oppositional view of the Acquisition.   \nIn addition to the capital commitment, the ALJ Report along with Opposing Parties assert \nthat the Commission “lacks authority to force the Partners to take actions such as . . . retaining \nemployees, making community investments, or withholding dividends.”77 These statements are \nwholly misleading because the Partners will not be the ones “to take  actions”  on these items . \nRather, t he employees in question will be employees of the Company ; the community investments \nwill also be made by the Company ; and dividends will be paid by the Company . The  Commission \nhas authority in each of these areas.   \nFinally, it is noteworthy that one of the parties to the Settlement, the Department, is \nstatutorily responsible for the enforcement of Minn. Stat. Ch. 216B.78 It is a stretch by any measure \nto believe the Department would enter a Settlement it did not consider enforceable or support this \nAcquisition if not confident that the Commission has the necessary authority and tools to fully \nprotect the public interest.  \nVI. THE PARTNERS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE INVESTORS IN ALLETE AND \nMINNESOTA POWER . \nIt is also important, in responding to Opposing Parties’ comments, to underscore that the  \nOpposing Parties continue to mischaracterize the  Partners as private equity stereotypes; indeed, \nCPP Investments and CalPERS are not private equity compan ies as they manage  the funds of \n \n77 ALJ Report at 73  (eDocket No. 20257 -221020 -02). \n78 Minn. Stat. § 216A.07, subd. 2 ( “The commissioner is responsible for the enforcement of chapters 216A, 216B and \n237 and the orders of the commission issued pursuant to those chapters.”) . \n \n30 pension plans , and GIP is a private infrastructure investor specifically focused on infrastructure \nentities , including regulated infrastructure .79 The Partners have made clear they will be responsible \ninvestors , through both their testimony and commitments, as described below.  \nNonetheless, t he comments of several Opposing Parties continue to invoke fears to oppose \nthe Acquisition, ignoring the prior commitments and supporting parties, as well as the  many \nadditional commitments in the Settlement that convinced the Department that the Acquisition is in \nthe public interest. These fears appear premised on assumptions that the Partners will take actions \nlike a stereotypical “private equity” investor that purchase s companies, slash es spending, and take s \nthem apart to extract value from  their pieces. Most of Opposing Parties’ argument s focus on \nconcerns related to “financial engineering” and over-reliance on  debt financing. For example, \nSierra Club imagines “unchecked ability for the Partners to engage in risky financial, operational, \nand governance engineering.”80 Similarly, t he OAG ’s Comments  advance  a misunderstanding that \nrisky and unreasonable use of debt is simply “a product of the private -equity investment model \nand thus unavoidable  . . . .”81  \nThe record provides absolutely no credible support for th ese assumptions . As an initial \nmatter, it is hard to see how these types of “financial engineering” even apply to a regulated utility \nwith strong Commission oversight like the Company. Opposing Parties cite no evidence that the \n \n79 These are meaningful distinctions as evidenced by the fact that entities like CPP Investments and CalPERS are \nallocating the investment in ALLETE through their respective \"real assets\" groups and not \"private equity.\" Partner \nInitial Post-Hearing  Brief at 3, 5  (eDocket No. 20255 -218522 -01). LIUNA , the only other party in this proceeding \nwith first -hand experience with the Partners, explained the same . LIUNA Witness Bryant testified that , while \n“witnesses offered by parties opposed to the transaction tend to lump all of private equity together, LIUNA’s pension \nfunds would not categorize the GIP Fund IV or the proposed transaction within our private equity asset class. None \nof the four LIUNA pensio n funds that invest in GIP’s Fund V consider this strategy to be in their private equity asset \nclass. ” Ex. LIUNA -852 at 11 ( Bryant Rebuttal ) (eDocket No. 20253 -216057 -01). \n80 Sierra Club Comments at 14 (eDocket No. 20258 -221736 -03). \n81 OAG Comments at 11 (eDocket No. 20258 -221723 -02). It is noteworthy that the OAG’s Comments take a much \nmore extreme position than the testimony of its expert, Witness Lebens, who found value in  the Partner s’ expertise in \nbalancing the use of debt and equity financing when he testified  that “The Partners’ expertise in optimizing the capital \nstructure, the cost of capital, and cash flow could help mitigate Minnesota Power’s rate increases.”  Ex. OAG -400 at \n26 (Lebens Direct) (eDocket No. 20252 -214937 -02). \n \n31 Partners have engaged in any of the practices about which they are concerned , but rather reference  \ngeneralized summaries in articles or textbooks  about “typical ” private equity investor practices .82 \nTo the contrary, as discussed below,  the Partners’ own internal documents and testimony \ndemonstrate that they have no intent to engage, and no track record of engaging, in any of those \npractices. Further, the Partners have agreed to Settlement commitments that were specifically \ndesigned to address and preclude those sorts of practices ,83 thereby eliminating any potential risks \nbased on these speculative concerns .  \nA. The Partners’ Internal Documents and Testimony Demonstrate that they will \nbe Responsible Investors for ALLETE and Minnesota Power . \nContrary to the Opposing Parties overgeneralizing  view that all private investors follow \nthe same stereotypical approach, the record shows through the Partners ’ internal documents and \ntestimony that the Partners explicitly reject financial engineering as an option in infrastructure \ninvesting.  As stated in GIP’s private placement memorandum,84 GIP’s approach to debt financing : \n[HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS … \n… HCTS INFORMATION ENDS ]85  \n \nSimilarly , Witness Alley explained that CPP Investments’ strategy in energy infrastructure \ninvestments, like ALLETE, “focus[es] on returns from sustainable, long -term investments, rather \n \n82 Department Witness Addonizio also stated he did \"not believe this aspect of financial engineering applies to \nregulated utilities as strongly as it does to non -regulated firms.\" See Ex. DOC-303 at 59 ( Addonizio Direct ) (eDocket \nNo. 20252 -214941 -01). \n83 See Settlement at 1.15 –1.22 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01). \n84 The Private Placement Memorandum is a document provided to prospective investors when raising money for a \nfund. The memorandum outlines the fund’s general investment strategy and terms and also describes in a general \nmanner any risks associated with invest ing in the fund.   As such, this document provides a window into GIP’s actual \napproach to its infrastructure investments, including this one, as conveyed to investors. It is evident that the Partners’ \npublic representations in this case regarding its approa ch to its investment in Minnesota Power fully align with GIP’s \nprivate representations to its investors.  \n85 Ex. DOC -303, CMA -D-12 at 75 (Addonizio Direct)  (eDocket No. 20252 -214942 -01) (HCTS) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA EXCISED\n\n \n32 than from short -run profits or operational turnarounds, or from financial engineering strategies that \nmight be more common in a stereotypical private equity investment scenario.”86 \nOther internal documents of the Partners confirm their intent to avoid excessive debt at \nboth ALLETE and Alloy Parent.  In their investment committee materials, the Partners were \nindependently and consistently clear that  they will target investment grade credit metrics for both \nALLETE (including both regulated and unregulated components)  and Alloy Parent , including a  \nFunds from Operations to debt ratio consistent with or better than the ratio of many other \nfinancially healthy utilit y companies .87  \nDespite  generalized speculation by Opposing Parties, the Partners’ internal documents \ncorroborate the commitments they have made, and show  that the Partners have no intention of \nusing risky “financial engineering” strategies or subjecting Minnesota Power to risks from high \nlevels of debt .88 \nB. The Partners Have Committed in the Settlement to be Responsible Investors \nin ALLETE and Minnesota Power.  \nThe Petitioners made  a number  of commitments in the Settlement specifically intended to \nensure the financial health of ALLETE and Minnesota Power. These commitments were not \nchosen randomly. They were specifically developed with the Department over months of \nnegotiation  to resolve the Department’s concerns about the possibility for financial engineering, \nand specifically about the potential risks related to debt financing.  \n \n86 Ex. MP-31 at 11  (Alley Rebuttal ) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -09). See also Ex. MP -14 at 7 ( Bram Direct ) (eDocket \nNo. 202412 -212968 -09) (“While these plans require significant investment in the near term, given the nature of utility \nregulation, GIP recognizes that earnings on those investments will be recovered over the long term.”).  \n87 Partner Initial Post -Hearing Brief at 70 (eDocket No. 20255 -218522 -01); Ex. MP -29, Schedule 6 (Taran Rebuttal) \n(eDocket No.  20253 -216055 -05).  \n88 Partner Initial Post -Hearing Brief at 62–75 (May 1, 2025) (eDocket No. 20255 -218522 -01); Minnesota Power ’s \nInitial Brief at 20 –27 (eDocket No.  20255 -218485 -02). \n \n33 To ensure that ALLETE does not become financially  harmed by its new investors, \nCommitment 1.16 ensures that any debt issued at the holding company level will not be guaranteed \nby utility assets, and Commitment 1.17 ensures that the Partners will not pledge the assets of \nALLETE or Minnesota Power to secure debt  of the Partners .89 If new debt is issued at the holding \ncompany level, it will be the exclusive responsibility of the Alloy Parent entities, not ALLETE or \nMinnesota Power – the precise opposite  of what Opposing Parties say is standard for stereotypical \nprivate equity companies.90 To ensure that the Commission has visibility into these financial \nmatters, Commitment 1.3 6 requires the maintenance of separate books and records for Alloy \nParent, and also requires those records to be available to the Commission. Along with Commitment \n1.37, Commitment 1.36 also ensure s that the Commission will receive regular filings of audited \nconsolidated financial statements from ALLETE and Alloy Parent.  \nThe Settlement also includes commitments that protect the Company’s investment -grade \ncredit rating.  Commitment  1.6 provides that the Company will not pay dividends unless it has an \ninvestment grade rating. If anything happens that causes ALLETE to no longer be rated investment \ngrade by one rating  agency, it will prevent the Partners from obtaining cash from the Company  \nand instead force that cash to be retained, improving the Company’s financial health . Commitment  \n1.9 provides that ALLETE will use commercia lly reasonable efforts to remain rated by at least two \ncredit rating agencies , ensuring that there will be ratings to evaluate . This commitment is important \nbecause there currently is no obligation for ALLETE to remain rated at all. Commitment s 1.11 and \n \n89 In an effort to undermine the significance of these commitments, OAG provides a matrix it claims illustrates that \n“many affiliate -related financial risks are left unaddressed by” the Settlement. OAG Comments at 12 –13 (eDocket \nNo. 20258 -221723 -02). This matrix calls into question whether OAG understands the purpose and intent of ring -\nfencing generally or the types of risks they find so concerning. For example, OAG appears concerned that they are \nnot sure whether the “Other Alloy Entities,” which w ould not generate any revenue or dividends, could themselves \npay a dividend in certain circumstances.  \n90 OAG Comments at 12 –13 (eDocket No. 20258 -221723 -02); CUB Comments at 7 (eDocket No.  \n20258 -221742 -03). \n \n34 1.34 will provide  the Commission with additional information on ALLETE, specifically the \nreports and documents from the credit ratings agencies to allow the Commission to monitor these \ncommitments and the financial health of ALLETE.   \nFurther, Commitment  1.10 confirms that the Partners understand that the capital structure \nof ALLETE and Minnesota Power are regulated by the Commission, and that the capital structure \nof the Company must continue to be maintained within the limits set by the Commission. With  \nrespect to capital structure specifically, the Partners understand and agree that the capital structure \ncannot be suddenly changed to include different debt and equity ratios than the Commission has \napproved. Commitment  1.7 ensures that  the Commission will receive regular reporting on the \nequity infusions and dividends that could lead to changes of this nature.  These commitments ensure \nthat the Acquisition  will not cause  changes to the Company’s  capital structure that negatively \nimpact its financial health.  \n These commitments dramatically mitigate the possibility of financial engineering, and the \nimpact of any risks that could result from financial engineering. If the Partners intended to engage \nin such conduct, they would not have agreed to these commitments . Instead,  the Partners have no \nintention of financial engineering and will be responsible investors in ALLETE and Minnesota \nPower, and despite the portrayal by Opposing Parties have no concerns sharing information with \nthe Commission to demonstrate compliance.  \nC. Opposing Parties’ Arguments Would Preclude the Use of Debt Financing, \nwhich would be Unreasonable.  \nOpposing Parties also continue to speculate based on stereotypic al assumptions about “all \nprivate investor s”91 and their approach toward the use of debt. Specifically, t he OAG and other \n \n91 Reply Post -Hearing Brief of C URE  at 7 (eDocket No. 20255 -219371 -02); Initial Brief of the OAG  at 13 (eDocket \nNo. 20255 -218508 -02); Initial Brief of LPI at 55  (eDocket No. 20255 -218497 -02).   \n \n35 Opposing Parties have claimed that the Partners will recklessly  increase debt leverage in a way \nthat harms customers. They base this claim largely on the modeled growth in overall debt levels.92 \nThat is not the correct analysis and is fundamentally at odds with how capital -intensive businesses, \nincluding all other utilities in Minnesota, operate.  \nMinnesota Power has a regulated capital structure that includes an approved debt ratio of \n47 percent.93 That means that with an overall authorized rate base of  $2.7 billion approved in its \nmost recent rate case,94 the corresponding amount of debt at Minnesota Power is approximately \n$1.3 billion . As the Company makes additional  investments, its total debt would increase even \nwhile the debt ratio remains the same. For example, assuming this exact same  capital structure, \nwhen Minnesota Power makes the $4.6 billion in investments under its five-year capital plan, it \nwould be expected to finance approximately $2. 16 billion (47 percent  of $4.6  billion ) using debt —\nresulting in an increase in overall debt for the Company but maintaining the same debt ratio .95 This \nmaintains a more or less optimized ratio of equity to debt that balances risk and cost of additional \ninvestments.96  \nOpposing Parties fail to acknowledge the fundamental fact that a potential increase in total \ndebt over the long -term is simply a result of the growth in ALLETE and in Minnesota  Power’s \nrate base, or that the Commission’s  own analysis focuses on the percentage  of debt, not the \n \n92 OAG Comments at 8  (eDocket No. 20258 -221723 -02).     \n93 See In the Matter of Minnesota Power’s Petition for Approval of its Capital Structure and Authorization to Issue \nSecurities , Docket No. E -015/S -25-138, ORDER  (July 11, 202 5) (eDocket No. 20257 -220858 -01). \n94 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Electric Service Rates in the State of \nMinnesota , Docket No. E015/GR -23-155, ORDE R ACCEPTING AND ADOPTING AGREEMENT SETTING RATES (Nov. 25, \n2024) (eDocket No. 202411 -212388 -01).  \n95 Ex. MP -29 at 3 (Taran Rebuttal)  (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -05). \n96 It is undisputed that every business, including ALLETE and Alloy Parent, has an optimal capital structure that will \nresult in the lowest cost of capital and that necessarily includes some equity and some debt. See, e.g ., Ex. CPPIB -GIP-\n204 at 1 (DOC Response to MP IR 0021) (eDocket No. 20254 -217241 -04) (“Figure 3 [from Mr. Addonizio’s direct \ntestimony] is intended to provide a general illustration of the impact capital structure has on a company’s cost of \ncapital. . . . [T]he general principles illustrated in the figure apply to Alloy Parent. As Alloy Parent’s debt ratio \nincreases, its cost of debt and equity will rise, and theoretically, there is an optimal capital structure that would \nminimize” its cost of capital) clarified at Evid. Hr. Tr. at 590:6 –16 (April 2, 2025) (correcting typo).  \n \n36 magnitude. That is exactly what the Partners’ models have done as well. Indeed, applying the same \nanalysis as the Commission applies demonstrates the reasonableness of the Partners’ modeling; \nthe Partners’ models focus on the right debt ratios for Alloy Pa rent, and as a result, debt increases \nto maintain pace with the growth of ALLETE and Minnesota Power.  \nOpposing Parties also appear to attack the entire concept of debt financing. T he OAG \nargues  that “there is no requirement that Alloy Parent provide any new equity at all —it may simply \n. . . take on additional debt  . . . to meet the commitment .”97 The OAG appears to assume that Alloy \nParent should not be allowed to borrow any funds  to make its equity investment in Minnesota \nPower. That position is absurd as a matter of business finance generally and as applied to \nMinnesota utilities in particular.  The record is clear that all businesses are financed using both debt \nand equity.98 There is no analytical basis to treat Alloy Parent any differently,  because doing so \nwould only make it more expensive to finance ALLETE and provide no benefit to anyone.  \nMoreover , it is a standard practice for Minnesota utilities to issue debt at the holding \ncompany level. Northern States Power Company, Otter Tail Power Company, and CenterPoint \nEnergy all have debt at the holding company level, which is used to make equity investments  in \ntheir Minnesota utilities.  Xcel Energy Inc. has approximately 60 percent debt in its overall capital \nstructure,99 Otter Tail Corporation has approximately 40 percent overall debt100 and CenterPoint \nEnergy Inc., has approximately 65 percent overall debt.101 Each of the Minnesota public  utilities \n \n97 OAG Comments at 8  (eDocket No. 20258 -221723 -02).   \n98 Ex. DOC -303 at 13  (Addonizio Direct ) (eDocket No. 20252 -214941 -01). \n99 Ex. MP -51 at Attachment 2 ( DOC’s Comments to Otter Tail Power’s 2024 Capital Structure Plan ) (eDocket No. \n0254 - 217287 -05). \n100 Id.  \n101 Ex. MP -52 at 4 ( DOC Comments to Northern States Power’s 2025 Capital Structure Plan ) (eDocket No. 20254 - \n217287 -06). \n \n37 receive all of their equity capital infusions from these parent companies, which are financed \npartially by the debt of the parent companies.102  \nThe same is true of public utility holding companies from other states.  Data on 35 publicly \ntraded utility holding companies that was included in the record in the 2024 Xcel Energy capital \nstructure filing showed that each of the holding companies uses debt financing.103 The average \npercentage of debt in the capital structure of these holding companies is approximately 58.5 \npercent.    \nThese facts make it clear that, notwithstanding the claims of the OAG and some other \nOpposing Parties, a level of borrowing by Alloy Parent to fund equity investments in ALLETE is \nneither unusual nor problematic.  The Opposing Parties have not conducted any analysis or \nproduced any evidence demonstrating that the ratio of debt that will be used at Alloy Parent is \nproblematic , they have only thrown out as a possibility that it could be . In contrast,  the Partners’ \ninternal documentation (described above) demon strates they are focused on reasonable financing \nstrategies, which the Opposing Parties have chosen to ignore.104 \nOverall, Opposing Parties downplay commitments to comply with existing requirements \nor protect against perceived risk as meaningless, while at the same time criticizing alleged lack of \ncommitments to the regulatory process and existing requirements.105 Similarly, if the Petitioners \n \n102 These entities also receive dividends from their utility subsidiaries while their utility subsidiaries themselves at \ntimes incur debt, meaning at some point the utility both has debt and pays a dividend, a confluence of events Opposing \nParties say must  mean these entities are engaging in dividend recapitalization. The flaw in this assumption \ndemonstrates the invalidity  of similar claims that this is a risk for ALLETE.  \n103 In the Matter of Northern States Power Company, doing business as Xcel Energy, Petition for Approval of its 2024 \nCapital Structure , Docket No. E -002/M-23-463, Petition  at Attachment  I-3b (Oct. 26, 2023)  (eDocket No. 202310 -\n199905 -01).  \n104 As explained further above, the overall amount of debt also will be managed in a financially responsible way, with \nthe Partners targeting debt levels that ensure continued ability of the Alloy Parent entities to make payments from \nfunds available. See supra  note 89 and accompanying text.  \n105 See, for example, Sierra  Club’s argument in one sentence of its exceptions that Petitioners fail to commit to comply \nwith the Carbon Free Standard, while in the next sentence arguing that “the promise to comply with the Carbon Free \nStandard is simply a restatement of existing leg al requirements that apply regardless of the transaction, and therefore \n \n \n38 make a commitment to maintain the status quo or achieve a Commission goal that parties have \nidentified as important, opposing parties now call it meaningless because there was no evidence \nMinnesota Power intended to make a change prior to the Acquisition.106 This ignores that \nMinnesota Power could not have made similar guarantees or even necessarily maintained the status \nquo in every respect (e.g., with respect to wage increases and contract extensions, community \ncommitments, charitable giving, no change to t he fundamentals of the Company) absent the \nAcquisition.  And even where the Opposing P arties are concerned about a potential effect of the \nAcquisition – as with debt, or transaction/transition costs – they fail to assign any value to \nmitigating efforts,107 thereby giving credence only to perceived risks and none to offsetting \ncommitments. This approach effectively – whether intentionally or not – creates a standard that \ncannot be met. Opposing Parties’ apparent unwillingness to acknowledge virtually any \ncommitment as either meaningful risk mitigation or a meaningful benefit implies entrenched \nopposition, rather than a balanced consideration of benefits, risks, and risk mitigation.   \nUltimately, the Partners do not come before the Commission seeking to  do anything but \ninvest in a Minnesota utility  company  precisely because of the supportive regulatory s tructure  – \nincluding for managing  the clean energy transition,  cost recovery, returns, and utility capital \nstructure – as it currently exists in Minnesota . That is the thesis of the Partners’ investments, rather \nthan schemes suggested by opposing parties based on an incorrect or incomplete understanding of \ninfrastructure funds and  capital  management . \n \nnot a benefit of the Acquisition.” See Sierra Club’s Exceptions and Statement of Support for the Administrative Law \nJudge’s Report at 10 (eDocket No. 20258 -221736 -02). \n106 Sierra Club Comments at 10 (eDocket No. 20258 -221736 -03). \n107 OAG Comments at 5 –8 and 11–12 (eDocket No. 20258 -221723 -02). \n \n39 VII. THE ACQUISITION IS PART OF THE PLAN FOR COMPLYING WITH THE \nCARBON FREE STANDARD . \nOpposing Parties also argue in Exceptions and Settlement Comments that the Acquisition \nwill create risks to the energy transition and the Carbon Free Standard . For example, Sierra Club \nargues that “the only commitment related to clean energy” is the $50 million Clean Firm \nTechnology Fund.108 That is fundamentally incorrect. The Settlement includes a binding \ncommitment that Alloy Parent will provide all the equity financing needed for the five-year capital \nplan, including $3.3 billion in investments for new transmission, new renewables, and new \nstorage .109 Further, the Partners’ investment documents repeatedly underscore that they consider \nMinnesota’s transition to a clean energy future to be a reason to invest. In addition, as noted above, \nMinnesota clean energy organizations strongly support the Acquisition.110 The idea that the \nSettlement does not support clean energy is altogether unfounded and wrong . \nIt is also unfathomable that Opposing Parties simply  discount a $50 million contribution \ntowards clean firm project s.111 It is clearly a benefit for customers and the public interest because \nall will benefit from a resource that would have cost more absent the Settlement. Pretending that a \n$50 million contribution is not meaningful is unserious, and the Commission should properly \nrecognize the commitment for what it is: a direct payment by the Par tners that will reduce rate \npressure in the future, and that is targeted to a resource that will be critical to achieving the Carbon \nFree Standard . \n \n108 Sierra Club Comments at 11  (eDocket No. 20258 -221736 -03). \n109 See Settlement at 1. 3 (eDocket No. 20257 -220879 -01); Petitioner s’ Joint Reply Brief at 10 (eDocket No. 20255 -\n219384 -02). \n110 See Section II, above.  \n111 See CURE Comments at 2  (eDocket No. 20258 -221739 -02); OAG Comments at 10  (eDocket No. 20258 -221723 -\n02). \n \n40  Sierra Club also argues that the Settlement is deficient because it does not “ensure” a clean \nenergy transition.112 No settlement could do so, and that is not something the Petitioners can or \nneed to prove. The Acquisition and the Settlement make it substantially more likely that the \nCompany can comply with the Carbon Free Standard  and Commission decisions in Integrated \nResource and Distribution, Certificate of Need, and other dockets  while maintaining reasonable \nrates and reliability. Doing so  will require continued effort, innovation, and financing  for many \nyears. The Acquisition helps ensure  that financing will not be a problem, so that the Company can \nfocus on solving problems and not figuri ng out how to finance the solutions . \nAgain, in discounting commitments in the Settlement , Opposing Parties fail to recognize  \nthat the status quo has risks, and substantial ones. The alternative to the Acquisition is not ALLETE \nachieving those carbon free goals with public investors; rather, it is a scenario where it is “highly \nunlikely ” that ALLETE achiev es those  carbon free goals : \nGiven the Company’s size, access to capital at the scale ALLETE has forecasted \nwould be at very high risk, and if the current operating environment (including tariff \nimpacts, large customer cyclicality, and policy uncertainty) remains, it would be \nhighly u nlikely the Company could achieve its carbon free goals as planned and \nother system investments (e.g., grid resilience investments and enhancements) \nwould also be threatened. Our ability to invest in advanced technologies, such as \nclean firm resources, wou ld also be jeopardized.113 \n \nThe problems related to tariffs, large customer cyclicality, and policy uncertainty have only gotten \nworse since the Company determined that Acquisition by the Partners was the best path forward. \nThe question is not whether the Acquisition will, on its own, ensure compliance with the C arbon \nFree Standard . The right question is whether the Acquisition puts the Company in a better  position \n \n112 Sierra Club Comments at 9  (eDocket No. 20258 -221736 -03). The ALJ Report includes a similar argument, \nsuggesting that the Petitioners had an obligation to “prove” that they could not achieve the CFS without the Acquisition \nand prove that the Acquisition would guarantee success of the CFS. ALJ Report at 66. These statements in the ALJ \nReport are similarly flawed . The Petitioners did not have to prove that the Acquisition would somehow solve the \nCarbon Free Standard, and no one could ever do so. The Petitioners have demonstrated that the Acquisition will \nsubstantially assist Minnesota Power’s efforts to achieve the CFS, which is a significant benefit for the public interest.  \n113 Ex. MP -28 at 9–10 (Scissons Rebuttal ) (eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -04).  \n \n41 to comply with the C arbon Free Standard  while continuing to provide reliable service at reasonable \nrates  – and t he record conclusively shows that it does .  \nThe Acquisition, including the terms in the Settlement, will ensure a better  source of equity \nfinancing for the Company than relying on public markets – particularly during this period of \nuncertainty. That is not only consistent with the public interest but provides a substantial public \nbenefit because it means that it is more likely that the Company will be able to successfully finance \nthe investments needed to comply with the Carbon Free Standard. For all the foregoing reasons, \nthe Company and Partners co ntinue to request that the Commission approve the Acquisition as \nconsistent with the public interest.  \nVIII.  CONCLUSION  \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Minnesota Power, GIP, and CPP Investments together \nrequest that the Commission approve the Acquisition, including the Settlement terms, and enter a \nbinding Commission Order accordingly.  \n \n \n42 Dated: August  14, 2025   Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBy:  /s/ Elizabeth M.

After weighing the benefits and risks of the  proposed acquisition of ALLETE by private -\nequity investors GIP and CPP (together, “the Partners ”), the ALJ concluded that the acquisition \nwould harm the public interest and recommended that the Commission deny its approval.   \nThe Petitioners’ exceptions do not provide a basis to disturb the ALJ’s key findings or her \nconclusion that the proposed acquisition is inconsistent with the public interest.  The Petitioners’ marquee argument is that the ALJ’s report should be rejected in its entirety because the ALJ is  \nbiased against them .  The Petitioners seem unable to understand why else the ALJ would discount \ntheir overconfident claims that the transaction holds only benefits and no risks.  But there is a much \nsimpler explanation.  T he ALJ’s decision is not hard to understand in light of her key credibility \nfinding: that the Petitioners are talking out one side of their mouths with their public filings and out the other in their private communications.   \nAs an independent and impartial factfinder, t he ALJ was not required to credit the \nPetitioners’ evidence or espouse their  theory of the case.  Indeed, the ALJ is obligated to conduct \nhearings and render a recommendation fairly and impartially and without bias or prejudice.\n1  She \ndid so in this case.  The Petitioners have not established a basis to reject the ALJ’s report or any \nof its key findings, and the Commission should adopt it.  \n \n1 Administrative law judges are subject to the Code of Judicial Conduct, Minn. Stat. § 14.48, subd. \n3(d), which requires them to  perform all duties “fairly and impartially” and “without bias or \nprejudice.”  Minn. Code of Judicial Conduct R. 2.2, 2.3(A).  \n2 LEGAL STANDARD  \nThe ALJ’s report “constitutes the final decision in the case” unless modified or rejected by \nthe Commission.2  The Commission may only modify or reject ALJ findings, conclusions, or \nrecommendations if its written order “include[s] the reasons for each  rejection or modification.”3  \nThe “best practice” for complying with this requirement is to identify each finding, conclusion, or \nrecommendation of the ALJ that the Commission rejects or modifies and provide the reasons for doing so.\n4  The Commission’s explanation must be sufficiently specific to enable a reviewing court \nto determine that its decision is based on substantial evidence and is not arbitrary or capricious.5   \nARGUMENT  \nI. THE ALJ’ S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE \nAND HER CREDIBILITY DETERMINATIONS . \nThere is no basis in this case to reverse the ALJ.  Her  report is well reasoned, \ncomprehensive, and thorough, comprising 283 numbered findings of fact, 19 numbered \nconclusions of law, and additional findings and conclusions in an attached memorandum.  These \nfindings and conclusions address each material issue in the case and are supported by substantial record evidence as in dicated in the accompanying footnotes.   \nCrucially, the ALJ’s rejection of the Petitioners’ positions is underpinned by a credibility \nfinding in her memorandum :  “In considering the true risks and benefits of the Acquisition, it is \ncritical that the Petitioners ’ agreements and private discussions do not comport with their public \nstatements. ”\n6  The Commission should not lightly disturb this finding.  And it certainly should not \n \n2 Minn. Stat. § 14.62, subd. 2a. \n3 Id., subd. 1 (emphasis added).  \n4 In re  Minn. Power , 12 N.W.3d 477, 491 (Minn. Ct. App. 2024) . \n5 See id . at 491–92.  \n6 ALJ Report , Memorandum at 66.  Unless otherwise noted, page -number citations to the ALJ \nReport in this Reply are based on the pagination in the public version.  \n3 do so without examining each confidential document in the record to assess whether the marketing-\nspeak that makes up most of the Petitioners’ public testimony is consistent with their private communications.  Such an examination is necessary if the Commission departs from the ALJ’s credibility determination, because it must provide a sufficiently specific explanation to enable judicial review.\n7  \nPetitioners’ exceptions do not present a basis to reject or modify the ALJ’s findings or \nconclusions on any material issue, much less her ultimate recommendation to disapprove the acquisition as inconsistent with the public interest.  First, the ALJ’s finding that the acquisition poses unacceptable risks is underpinned by documentary evidence of the Partners’ private communications.  Second, objective evidence supports the ALJ’s finding that ALLETE has not \nestablished that the acquisition will result in better access to capital or even that ALLETE needs \nimproved access.  Third, the ALJ’s finding that the Partners’ commitments provide few affirmative benefits in relation to the risks of the acquisition is supported by the record.  And finally, the ALJ’s interpretation of the “public interest” standard to require a showing of net benefit is reasonable, and adopting the Petitioners’ preferred standard would not change the result.  \nFor these reasons , and as further explained below, the Commission should adopt the ALJ’s \nreport in full and deny approval of the proposed acquisition.  \nA. The ALJ’s Concerns About the Risks of Private Equity Are Not Generalized  \nbut Based  on the Partners’ Own Statements.  \nPetitioners claim  that the ALJ err s by buying into generalizations about private equity \ninvestors and assuming that they apply to the Partners.\n8  But even a cursory reading of the ALJ’s \nreport shows this claim to be false.  The ALJ’s detailed findings rely largely on the Partners’ own \n \n7 See In re  Minn. Power , 12 N.W.3d at  491–92.  \n8 Petitioner Exceptions at 25. \n4 documents, which demonstrate the risks that these specific investors’  ownership of ALLETE \nwould pose for Minnesota Power and its customers.  T able 1, below, summarizes passages from \nhighly confidential documents quoted at length by the ALJ to support her risk findings and which  \nform the basis of her finding that “ the Petitioner s’ agreements and private discussions do not \ncomport with their public statements .”9 \nTable 1 – \nNot-Public Evidence Cited by ALJ  \nALJ \nFinding  Topic of Redacted Not -Public Material  \n73 GIP’s fossil -fuel holdings  \n75 GIP’s internal rates of return  \n76 GIP Fund V average hold period \n78 GIP Fund V investment strategies  \n105 GIP’s ALLETE- specific investment strategy  \n106 CPP’s ALLETE- specific investment strategy  \n183–84 Availability of capital to meet ALLETE’s \nneeds  \n189–94 Partners’ planned return and leveraging \nstrategy  \n199 Partners’ leveraging strategy  \n206–07 GIP’s planned hold period \n209–10 Partners’ exit strategy  \n215 Partners’ planned return for ALLETE  \n218–21 ALLETE and Partner rate -increase forecasts  \n224 Fund V operational -engineering tools  \n247 Partners’ consent rights over ALLETE board decisions  \n253–55 Partners’ plans to actively manage ALLETE  \n262–63 Partners’ consent rights over ALLETE board decisions  \n \n9 ALJ Report, Memorandum at 66. \n5 Table 1 – \nNot-Public Evidence Cited by ALJ  \nALJ \nFinding  Topic of Redacted Not -Public Material  \n271 Partners’ plans for affiliate dealings  \n273 Partners’ consent rights  \n \nThe Petitioners ask the Commission to waive away these findings and risks because they  \n“fail[] to fully and accurately reflect who the Partners actually are.”10  But the  Commission, like \nthe ALJ, has a duty not to simply take the Partners’ claims on faith but to weigh the Petitioners’ \npublic testimony and claims about the risks of the acquisition against their more candid private \nstatements.  At the hearing, intervenors  urged the ALJ to do just that .  In its opening statement, the \nDepar tment argued that “ the Partners ’ public representations to regulators and those that have been \nmade privately to investors  don’t match up ”11 and that “ it’s critical that the  Commission closely \nexamine GIP ’s and CPP ’s internal  assessments and private representations to  investors .”12  The \nOAG, likewise, urged the ALJ to “ look at what the Petitioners tell regulators about their plans for \nMinnesota Power and what the  Petitioners tell their investors about their plans  for Minnesota \nPower .”13 \nIn short, the ALJ was asked to make a credibility determination.  The ALJ was not required \nto credit the Petitioners’ self -serving public claims  in the face of contrary evidence , and neither is \nthe Commission.  Instead, the Commission should find, as the ALJ did, that the  proposed  \nacquisition poses  unacceptable risks for ratepayers, Minnesota Power, and northern Minnesota . \n \n10 Petitioner Exceptions at 26. \n11 Evid.

The ALJ Rightly  Rejected the Petitioners’ Effort to Spin ALLETE’s Access to \nVast Pools of Public Capital as a Negative.  \nIn their exceptions, the Petitioners reprise rejected  claims  about the need for  the acquisition.  \nFor example, t hey argue that ALLETE’s “continuing to rely on public markets was unlikely to be \nsuccessful”14 and that doing so would “pose profound risks to the public interest” in part because \nof the alleged  higher cost of obtaining capital in public markets.15  These claimed  risks of not \napproving the acquisition  are simply  the flipside of the claimed  benefits of approving it —better \naccess to capital —which the ALJ discounted as speculative  and unproven.  The ALJ was correct \nto see through Petitioners ’ self-serving claim that being listed on  the New York Stock Exchange \nis a hindrance to accessing capital , and the record contains a mple evidence to support the \nconclusion that ALLETE already has more than adequate access to capital.    \nFirst, d espite claiming that the acquisition is the only way to obtain the capital that \nALLETE needs, Petitioners were unable to cite any previous instance where the company had been  \nunable to obtain sufficient public  capital to fund regulated operations.16  This makes sense:   A \nmajor reason, if not the  reason, that companies seek to become publicly traded is to raise capital \nand broaden opportunities for future access to capital .17  This is exactly why ALLETE originally \nchose to become listed  on the NYSE .18  And ALLETE provide d no quantitative analysis of the \ndifficulty or risk of continuing to financ e its capital needs in the public market,19 despite  evidence \nthat company size plays little role in investor decisions once a company attains a $250 to $500 \n \n14 Petitioner Exceptions at 49. \n15 See i d. at 54 –57. \n16 ALJ Report ¶ 131 (citing Ex.

OAG- 400 at 13 (Lebens Direct) (noting that ALLETE’s predecessor became listed on \nNYSE  to access capital needed to build power plants and  accommodate increasing industrial load \nin 1950s through 70s). \n19 ALJ Report ¶ 131 (citing Evid. Hrg. Tr. vol. 1 at 286–93) . \n7 million market capitalization .20  All of this evidence supports the ALJ’s finding that ALLETE \nfailed to show that it needs better access to capital.  \nAdditional evidence, cited by the ALJ, supports her decision not to credit the Petitioners’ \nclaims about capital access.   The idea that ALLETE cannot continue to rely on the public market \nis contra dicted by the actions of ALLETE’s board and by the company’s securities filings.  Far \nfrom public financing being infeasible , ALLETE had a “standalone” financing plan that its board \nwas prepared to move forward with —at least until the Partners came up with a 20 percent \npremium .21  And  ALLETE’s ability to rely on standalone financing is also bolstered by its  2023 \nand 2024 Form 10- K reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  These \nreports both state that ALLETE is  “well positioned to meet our financing needs due to adequate \noperating cash flows, available additional working capital and access to capital markets ”—without \nregard to a private -equity acquisition.22   \nFinally, the ALJ ’s apparent belief that the acquisition was not really about better capital \naccess is supported by the fact that ALLETE’s board continued bargaining for an ever -higher \npremium, driving away prospective capital suppliers until it was left with only two.23  The board’s \nactions show that t he acquisition  is not primarily  about obtaining better access to low -cost capital \nfor the benefit of Minnesota Power’s customers .

The Partners will need to make back the full premium they paid for ALLETE to hit their profit targets .  Despite the Partners’ commitment not to attempt to recover that premium in \nrates,\n27 the premium, plus a return, will ultimately have come out of ratepayers’ pockets.28  This  \nevidence and other evidence cited by the ALJ’s report supports her conclusion that “ Petitioners \nhave not shown that the Acquisition will improve ALLETE’s access to capital.”29 \nFor all these reasons, the Commission should reject the premise that the acquisition  is \nneeded or  will provide  better capital access.  \n \n24 See Ex.

The ALJ E valuated the C ommitments Presented During the Contested Case  \nand Found that They Offered Marginal Benefits  Relative to the Risks , and the \nStipulation’s Belated Commitments Do Not Alter Her Analysis.  \nPetitioners assert that  the ALJ’s report  “simply  disregards” their proposed commitments,30 \nbut this claim is patently false .  The report devotes 41 findings, spanning 11 full pages , to \nevaluating the proposed commitments.31  The Petitioners’ true grievance appears to be that the \nALJ did not assign the same value to the ir commitments  as the Petitioners  do.  But  the ALJ was \nnot required to agree with the Petitioners, and  her detailed findings regarding the proposed \ncommitments fully support her conclusion that the y “offer few affirmative benefits beyond certain \nbenefits to labor and low -income interests.”32   \nThe Petitioners also appear to fault the ALJ’s report for not including findings on new \ncommitments supplied in a stipulation filed two business days before her report was due.33  The \nALJ explained that though she was  unable to incorporate the stipulation into her findings, she had \nnonetheless review ed it and found that it did not resolve her concerns with the proposed \nacquisition.34  For the reasons explained in its comments on the stipulation, the OAG agrees.35   \nThe stipulation largely repeats commitments the Petitioners already made in earlier stages \nof the case, a nd the handful of new commitments are inadequate to rebalance the scales to avoid \nnet harm to the public interest :  The stipulation’s new commitments fail to  mitigate the \ntransaction’s rate -related risks or materially increase ratepayer benefits.36  The y fail to  ensure that \nthe Partners will fund Minnesota Power’s energy transition while maintaining its financial health.37  \n \n30 Petitioner  Exceptions at  58. \n31 See ALJ Report ¶¶ 139– 80. \n32 Id. ¶ 179.  \n33 See Pet. Exceptions at 58–59. \n34 ALJ Report , Memorandum  at 67 n.549. \n35 See generally OAG Comments ( Aug. 4, 2025).  \n36 Id. at 5–8. \n37 Id. at 8–14. \n10 And the y fail to  mitigate the risks the Partners’ ownership of Minnesota  Power  poses to the \nregulatory compact or the threat that the Partners will cause the utility to enter into contracts that \nbenefit their other holdings at ratepayers’ expense.38 \nPetitioners argue that their commitments provide $685 per customer in  “financial \nbenefit s,”39 but closer examination shows these alleged benefit s to be chimerical.  The bulk of th e \n“financial benefit s” derives from commitments that reflect the status quo or  do not offer the level \nof ratepayer benefit  asserted .  For example, the “rate case stay  out” commitment is counted as \nhaving a $25 million value despite the fact that Minnesota Power is unlikely to be able to file a rate case much  sooner than proposed under the stay- out.  Similarly, the “equity flotation cost” \ncommitment is counted as having a $29.5 million value even though Minnesota Power’s regulated return currently does not reflect any specific amo unt of flotation costs  and the commitment does \nnot promise a specific reduction to the utility’ s return in future rate cases.  Moreover, the $50 \nmillion clean firm technology fund commitment does not provide a direct ratepayer benefit —\ninstead, the fund would be used to offset  some of  the capital costs of future projects for which the \nbalance would be recovered from ratepayer s.   \nThe claim of a $685 benefit per customer is also deceptive because the overall benefit \nwould not be distributed evenly among customer classes —instead, classes with the highest energy \nuse would receive most of the benefit.  Large industrial customers drive  about 60 percent of \nALLETE’s total annual revenue\n40 and would receive the lion’s share of the alleged benefits.  For \nother customer classes, the alleged benefits would be significantly less .  And, e ven if $685 reflected \n \n38 Id. at 14 –20. \n39 See Petitioner Exceptions, attach. C. \n40 ALJ Report ¶ 65.  \n11 the true per -customer benefit of Petitioners’ commitments , which it doesn’t , that amount  is \ninsignificant compared with the acquisition’s rate -related and other risks.  \nFinally , neither the new commitments  nor their alleged financial benefit were subject to \ntesting through discovery, expert analysis, or  cross -examination of the Petitioners’ witnesses.   \nDespite the evidentiary hearing having conclud ed on April  3 and post -hearing briefing on May 29, \nthe Department of Commerce and Petitioners did not file their stipulation until July 11 —over two \nmonths after the hearing, six weeks after the close of briefing, and just two business days before \nthe ALJ’s report was set to release.  This deprived intervenors of a meaningful opportunity to \nscrutinize the new commitments.41  Even so, the ALJ took the time to review the stipulation, \naddress ed it in the memorandum attached to her  report, and correctly conclude d that it failed to  \nresolve the concerns detailed  in her report.42   \n Accordingly, the Commission should adopt the ALJ’s findings regarding the Petitioners’ \ncommitments and should find their new commitments inadequate to render the acquisition \nconsistent with the public interest.  \nD. The Petitioners’ C laim  that the ALJ Applied the Wrong Legal Standard Is \nIncorrect  and a Red Herring  Because the Acquisition Also Fails Under Their \nStandard.  \nThe Petitioners argue that the ALJ “gets the law wrong” because she interprets Minnesota  \nStatutes section  216B.50’s directive  that a transaction be “consistent with the public interest” to \nrequire a showing of a net benefit  to the public interest .  In her memorandum, the  ALJ analyzes \nthe section 216B.50 standard in depth.  She  acknowledges that some prior Commission orders \nhave applied a “no net harm” standard in reviewing mergers  but provides a lengthy explanation \n \n41 See Ex Parte Communication (July 24, 2025)  (attaching July 18 letter from Department refusing \nto respond to LPI discovery requests regarding stipulation). \n42 ALJ Report Memorandum at 67 n.549.  \n12 for why, in her view, the “net benefit” requirement  is a better statutory interpretation .43  The OAG \nconcurs with the ALJ that the Commission should revisit its interpretation  of section 216B.50.  \nMore importantly, however, the ALJ correctly determined that the acquisition is not in the public \ninterest regardless of the standard applied.  \nA net-benefit standard is a better interpretation of “consistent with the public interest” than \na no-net-harm standard.  In particular, the OAG agrees with  the ALJ’s conclusion that a  net-benefit \nstandard “ best fits the intent of the Legislature to ensure that utility services in Minnesota are \nprovided reliably and at reasonable rates. ”44  This interpretation is also consistent with the canon \nof construction that consumer -protection statutes are “remedial in nature and are to be liberally \nconstrued to that end” —that is, construed to provide increased protection to consumers.45  But \nultimately, as the ALJ recognized, it does not matter which standard the Commission applies  here \nbecause the proposed acquisition would result in net harm to the public interest .46  The \nCommission should reject the acquisition under either standard.  \nGiven the ALJ’s finding that the acquisition fails  under either standard, she effectively \napplied the standard that the Petitioner s are advocating for .  Moreover, the decision about whether \na transaction is consistent with the public interest should rarely , if ever , turn on the distinction \nbetween a net benefit and “no net harm,” since the dividing line between the two is infinitesimally small.  In other words, it is almost impossible for a transaction to cause no net harm but not provide a net benefit, and  to claim that there could be a case where the distinction matters assumes an \nimplausible  degree of precision in the public -interest analysis.   The Commission should reject the \n \n43 ALJ Report, Memorandum at 63–65. \n44 Id. at 65. \n45 Riehm v. Comm’r of Pub. Safety , 745 N.W.2d 869, 873–74 (Minn. Ct. App. 2008) . \n46 ALJ Report, Memorandum at 65. \n13 acquisition because it is inconsistent with the public interest applying either a net- benefit or no-\nnet-harm standard.  \nII. UNABLE TO PERSUADE THE ALJ  OF THE MERITS OF THE ACQUISITION , ALLETE  AND  \nTHE PARTNERS  ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT HER. \nUnhappy with the ALJ’s decision, the Petitioners argue that her report should be rejected \nin its entirety  due to her (1) conduct of the hearing, ( 2) adoption of certain intervenors’  proposed \nfindings, and (3) characterization of public comments.47  The implication appears to be that the \nALJ based her decision on animus or other improper factors .  Suggesting that an ALJ acted in this \nway would be a weighty accusation.48  And  a much more straightforward explanation for the ALJ’s \ndecision is that she simply did not find the Petitioners’ theory of the case believable.   Petitioners’ \neffort  to impugn the integrity of a n ALJ  for doing her job gives the Commission a taste of  how \nregulating Minnesota Power may  change for the worse  if it approves the acquisition.  \nA. The ALJ’s H andling of the Evidentiary H earing Was F air. \nThe Petitioners complain about the ALJ’s conduct of the evidentiary hearing, arguing that \nthey were “denied an opportunity to correct documents in which errors were discovered during the \nevidentiary hearing, while other parties were permitted to do so.”49  The Petitioners’ arguments do \nnot survive even the most basic scrutiny.  First, the suggestion that the ALJ made an unfavorable \nevidentiary ruling against the Petitioners is false because they withdrew the request before the \njudge could rule on it.  Second, the other rulings cited by the Petitioners do not evince preferential \ntreatment, nor did they prejudice the Petitioners in any way.  And finally, the ALJ demonstrated \nher impartiality by denying procedural requests that the Petitioners opposed. \n \n47 See Petitioner Exceptions at 5, 17, 20. \n48 Administrative law judges are subject to the Code of Judicial Conduct, Minn. Stat. § 14.48, subd. \n3(d), which requires judges perform all duties “fairly and impartially” and “without bias or \nprejudice.” Minn. Code of Judicial Conduct R. 2.2, 2.3(A).  \n49 Id. at 20. \n14 The Petitioners’ first argument is that the ALJ showed partiality by denying their request \nto introduce an updated version of a key exhibit on the second day of trial.  Yet the admission of a \nnew version of the exhibit at such a late date would have prejudiced  intervenors oppos ing the \nacquisition.  And, in any event, the Partners never gave the ALJ a chance to rule on its admission; instead, the transcript  show s that they never offered  it.   \nThe exhibit at issue i s a preliminary term sheet between the Partners reflecting their plans \nfor post -acquisition governance of ALLETE.\n50  The term sheet i s the only direct, documentary \nevidence of the Partners’ plans for jointly controlling their investment in ALLETE.  The Partners had already updated the term sheet once during the course of the proceedings, providing a heavily revised version with their surrebuttal testimony.\n51  After cross examination of ALLETE’s CFO \nrevealed that he did not understand the term sheet, the Partners indicated their intent to offer a new version with a “correction” to make it consistent with the CFO’s testimony.\n52  The Partners, \nhowever, then changed course  did not offer the new version.53  For the Petitioners to claim that the \nALJ “did not permit the Partners to introduce a corrected version of the document ”54 is inaccurate.  \nIt was never offered.  And allowing the “correction” into the record would have added little value  \nanyway , since nothing prevented the Partners from revising their governance plans again after the \nevidentiary record closed —or even  after approval of the acquisition. \nThe Petitioners attempt to contrast the ALJ’s treatment of the Partners’ term sheet with her \nrulings on updated documents submitted by intervenors, but these examples are apples to oranges.   \n \n50 See Ex. DOC -301, sched. SLV -D-6 (Vavro HCTS Direct)  (attaching  original  term sheet) . \n51 See Ex. MP -41, sched. 1 (Bram HCTS Surrebuttal)  (attaching updated term sheet) . \n52 Evid. Hrg. Tr. vol. 2 at 335 (Apr. 2, 2025) . \n53 Id. at 369 (“ I first want  to clarify that we haven ’t yet offered the document.  . . . But given the \nobjections, we no longer intend to offer it.”).  \n54 Petitioner Exceptions at 20. \n15 First, the Petitioners complain that the judge  unfairly allowed the OAG to introduce an \nupdated copy of a GIP presentation to CalPERS  that had originally been attached to the OAG’s \ndirect testimony.55  The version attached to direct testimony contained redactions that GIP later \nremoved as a result of negotiations with the Department.56  At hearing, the OAG moved the \nadmission of a newer version of the presentation, Exhibit OAG -412, that was identical  to the \ndirect -testimony attachment but for  the removal of redactions.57  The OAG sought to include the \nless-redacted version the record purely in the interest of transparency and completeness.58  The \nPetitioners, however, vociferously objected to  the introduction of OAG -412 despite admitting that \nthere was “no surprise” to the  Partners  given that the presentation had been created by GIP.59 \nAfter asking questions of the parties and reviewing the redactions, the ALJ reached a \nreasonable resolution: she allowed OAG -412 into evidence but permitted the Petitioners to file \nsupplemental testimony responding to the redacted portions of the exhibit.60  The ALJ summed up \nher ruling as follows:  “I understand the objections and this is not an ideal situation in any way.  \nHowever, my job here is to develop a complete record, and I do think that the  Commission would \nbenefit from seeing the full document, given that it was eventually produced.”61  Far from \ndemonstrating partial treatment, the ALJ’s ruling reflects her effort to develop a full, transparent \nrecord while providing the Petitioners  with the opportunity to respond. \n \n55 See id. at 20 –21 & n.78 (citing Evid. Hrg. Tr. vol. 3 at 733–53).  \n56 See Ex. OAG -401, sched. BPL -D-8 (Lebens HCTS Direct) (attaching presentation). \n57 Evid. Hrg.

The Petitioners complain that the ALJ allowed the Sierra Club to \nintroduce a correction to its surrebuttal testimony “deleting a word and adding a word.”63  But the \nPetitioners did not object to these minor tweaks,64 which are hardly comparable to the material \nchange the Partners  proposed to their  term sheet.    \nFinally, the Petitioners fail to disclose  that the ALJ ruled in their favor on two procedural \nmotions made by the Department at the outset of the evidentiary hearing.  The Department requested, first, that the Petitioners not be allowed to separately cross -examine witnesses but \ninstead consolidate their cross -examination through a single attorney.\n65  The judge denied this \nrequest  after the Petitioners opposed it .66  Second, the Department requested that  witnesses be \nsequestered to avoid the ir testimony being influenced by the cross -examination of other \nwitnesses.67  The judge also denied this request  after the Petitioners opposed it .68   \nThroughout the hearing, the ALJ thoughtfully and fairly ruled on various procedural \nmotions and requests.  No preference was shown to any party, as evidenced  by the even- handed \noutcomes, with the Petitioners prevailing at times and intervenors prevailing at others.  For all \nthese reasons, t he Commission should reject the Petitioners’ unfounded criticisms  of the ALJ’s \nhandling of the evidentiary hearing.  \n \n62 See Petitioner Exceptions at 20–21 & n.78 (citing Evid. Hrg. Tr. vol 3 at 809). \n63 Evid. Hrg. Tr. vol. 3 at 809  (Apr. 3, 2025) . \n64 Id. at 829–30.  \n65 Prehrg. Tr. at 24 (Mar. 28, 2025). \n66 Id. at 27. \n67 Id. at 44. \n68 Evid. Hrg. Tr. vol. 1 at 73 (April 1, 2025).  \n17 B. The ALJ’s S ubstantial Adoption of  the Public -Interest  Intervenors’ Proposed \nFindings Was Proper and Consistent with Her Rejection of the Petitioners’ \nTheory of the Case . \nThe Petitioners contend  that the ALJ’s report is “copied from opposing parties’ proposed \nfindings nearly word -for-word” and argue that this “show [s] a lack of independent judgment.”69  \nThey attach a redline d document showing the similarity of the ALJ’s findings to those proposed \nby Public Interest Intervenors.70  But i t should come as no surprise  that an ALJ would borrow \nheavily from the findings of the parties whose theory of the case she  agrees with .  And t here is \nnothing improper about a tribunal copying from  a party’s proposed findings —that is the whole \npoint of proposed findings.  The ALJ’s findings are supported by substantial evidence and \narticulate a rational connection between the facts found and the conclusions reached, and the \nCommission should adopt them. \nIt is a standard practice, both in trial courts and in administrative proceedings, for judges \nto ask parties to provide proposed findings.  “ Adoption of a party’s proposed findings by a district \ncourt is generally an accepted practice,”71 especially in cases “involving highly technical issues.”72  \nIt is even permissible for a trial court to adopt the prevailing party ’s proposed findings verbatim  \nas long as  the findings are supported by the record.73  The rule is similar for administrative \nproceedings.  An agency may adopt a party’s proposed findings word- for-word as long as the \nfindings are “specific and sufficient enough to enable meaningful review .”74 \n \n69 Petitioner  Exceptions at  5–6. \n70 The Public Interest Intervenors who submitted joint findings were  the OAG, Citizens Utility \nBoard of Minnesota, Large Power Intervenors, CURE, and Sierra Club.  \n71 Schallinger v. Schallinger , 699 N.W.2d 15, 23 (Minn. Ct. App. 2005). \n72 Mayview Corp. v. Rodstein, 620 F.2d 1347, 1352 (9th Cir. 1980) . \n73 See Dukes v. State , 621 N.W.2d 246, 258–59 (Minn. 2001). \n74 In re Appeal of Staley , 730 N.W.2d 289, 295 (Minn. Ct. App. 2007) .   \n18 In this case, the  ALJ was presented with  dueling sets of proposed findings —one  submitted \nby the Petitioners and their allies75 and the other  submitted by the Public  Interest Intervenors.76  \nThe Department of Commerce was the only party not to sign onto or submit any proposed \nfindings .77  The two sets of proposed findings reflect diametrically opposed views of the proposed \nacquisition .  Having presid ed over a months -long administrative process, he ld a three- day \nevidentiary hearing, and consider ed the parties’ evidence and arguments, the ALJ ultimately \nagreed with the Public Interest Intervenors that the risks of the proposed acquisition were real and \nits benefits not well established.  It was therefore natural that she  would rely on their proposed \nfindings.  Even so, the ALJ did not mechanically  adopt the Public Interest Intervenors’ proposed \nfindings  without change;  instead , she incorporat ed them into her report with change s throughout .  \nThe Petitioners are unable to cite a case where  a court reversed an administrative agency’s \nadoption of proposed findings.  Instead, they selectively  reproduce  boilerplate from state and \nfederal appellate- court opinions  to suggest that the practice  is disfavored.78  But the se opinions  \neither upheld the adoption of  proposed findings79 or reversed based on facts dissimilar to this \n \n75 See Joint Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation to Approve the \nAcquisition (May 29, 2025). The parties joining these findings were Minnesota Power, C PP, G IP, \nEnergy CENTS Coalition, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49, North Central \nStates Regional Council of Carpenters, Laborers International Union of North America —\nMinnesota and North Dakota, and International Brotherhood of Electrical Worker s Local 31.  \n76 See Joint Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations of the Public \nInterest Intervenors (May 29, 2025). The Public Interest Intervenors signing on to these proposed findings were the OAG, Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, Large Power Intervenors, CURE, \nand Sierra Club . \n77 No filing from the Department exists on official record  in the eDockets system.  \n78 See Petitioner Exceptions at  6–8. \n79 In re Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minn., 624 N.W.2d 264, 275 (Minn. \n2001)  (reversing lower court’s reversal of agency decision that “adopted approximately three -\nquarters of the ALJ ’s 199 findings of fact ”); Dukes , 621 N.W.2d at 259 (affirming district court’s \nwholesale adoption of state’s proposed findings); Johnson v.

Isanti Cnty., 408 N.W.2d 654, 657 \n19 case.80  And in not a single one of these cases did the decisionmaker produce a memorandum \nclearly explaining why she discredited the losing party’s evidence , as the ALJ did here .81 \nIn sum, e ven if the ALJ had  adopted the Public Interest Intervenors’  findings  verbatim , this \nwould not be improper .  Moreover, the findings themselves are detailed, specific, and address all \nmaterial disputed issues, and the ALJ’s memorandum makes clear why she did not credit the \nPetitioners’ evidence .  If, however, the Commission believes that additional  findings are \nappropriate , it should not take the drastic remedy of rejecting the ALJ’s report entirely  as the \nPetitioners advocate.

The Petitioners  Personally  Attack the ALJ Because They Disagree with Her \nSummary  of Public Comments.  \nThe Petitioners complain that the ALJ’s summary of public comments is one -sided because \nit notes that many of the comments supporting the acquisition “ largely repeated the Petitioner s’ \nemployee and public messaging about the Acquisition” and that many supporters were Minnesota \nPower employees or community organizations that had received funds from Minnesota Power.82  \nThe Petitioners describe th e ALJ’s characterization  as “inappropriate and insulting” and conclude \nthat the ALJ’s “ cavalier dismissal of the comments in support of the Acquisition is a sign of deep \ndisrespect for the people in northern Minnesota who chose to make their opinions known” and  “a \nsign of troubling bias against the Acquisition and those supporting it.”83 \nThe Petitioners ’ criticism of  the ALJ  here crosses the line from zealous advocacy into an \nad hominem  attack.  It is one thing to disagree with an ALJ’s characterization of public comments \nor other findings, but it is quite another to personally attack the tribunal in this way.  Nothing stated \nin the ALJ’s summary of public comments warrants  such an extreme response .  Far from the \nPetitioners ’ characterization, t he ALJ presided over a complex proceeding and rendered fair and \nimpartial findings.  She performed her duties professionally, diligently, fairly and impartially , and \ncertainly without bias or prejudice.84  The Commission should firmly reject the Petitioners’ \nuncalled -for attack on the ALJ’s character , professionalism , and judicial temperament .   \nCONCLUSION \nUnable to persuade the ALJ of the merits of their case, the Petitioners lash out in an attempt \nto discredit her.  But nothing required the ALJ to believe the Petitioners’ evidence or arguments; \nindeed, she had a duty to fairly and impartially weigh the evidence and determine whether the \n \n82 Summary of Public Comments at 1. \n83 Petitioner Except ions at 18. \n84 See Minn.

She \nfound that the Petitioners’ claims that “going private” held only benefits and no risks were \noverstated  and contradicted by the Petitioners’ own documents , most of which  the public is not \nallowed to see.  G iven the documented risks  and the unsubstantiated benefits , the ALJ  found that \nthe acquisition would result in net harm to public interest.   \nThe Petitioners’ unjustified attack on a public servant is troubling and provides a glimpse \nof how new ownership could change Minnesota Power’s regulatory advocacy.  The Commission should find that this and other risks detailed in the ALJ’s report and the voluminous record render the proposed acquisition inconsistent with the public interest and deny its approval . \n \nDated:   August 14, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \nKEITH ELLISON  \nAttorney General  \nState of Minnesota  \n  /s/ Peter G.
