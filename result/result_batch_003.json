I simply cannot afford to pay for BlackRock’s greed. I have worked too hard all mylife to afford a life of my own and I cannot let my livelihood and independence be strippedaway by rising costs due to corporate greed.\nI strongly urge you to reject this deal.

Docket 24-198\nLeave a comment on the docket. *\nI am writing as a concerned citizen and ratepayer to express my strong opposition to the proposed\nacquisition of Allete (parent company of Minnesota Power) by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), aBlackRock-owned entity. This acquisition poses serious risks to consumers, transparency,Indigenous rights, and the state’s clean energy future.\n1. Risk of Rate Hikes and Financial BurdenBlackRock and GIP are profit-driven private equity entities with a history of prioritizing short-term\nfinancial returns. The premium paid for this acquisition is substantial — and without adequatesafeguards, that cost is likely to be passed on to ratepayers through higher utility bills. Minnesotansshould not be forced to subsidize Wall Street investment returns.\n2. Greenwashing and Environmental DoublespeakBlackRock has been credibly accused of greenwashing, making misleading sustainability claims while\nremaining one of the largest global investors in fossil fuels. Despite its public ESG posture, the firmcontinues to fund companies tied to deforestation, climate change, and environmental degradation.There is no assurance that BlackRock will honor any clean energy commitments made during thisprocess — especially as prior promises across its portfolio have often been vague andunenforceable.\n3. Harms to Indigenous Communities and LandBlackRock’s portfolio includes investments in companies that have been accused of violating\nIndigenous land rights, displacing communities, and ignoring sovereign consent. Minnesota’s publicutility infrastructure must not be placed under ownership that has a track record of environmentalinjustice.\n4. Reduced Oversight and Public TransparencyUnlike public companies, private equity-owned utilities are less transparent. Critical decisions —\nfrom infrastructure investment to pricing — could be made behind closed doors. That weakenspublic accountability and threatens the Commission’s ability to oversee ratepayer protections.\n5. Regulatory and Legal Concerns\nBlackRock has faced multiple investigations and lawsuits related to anticompetitive behavior and ESG\nmisrepresentation. Notably:\nThe SEC charged BlackRock Advisors with misleading investors in 2023.A 2024 lawsuit in France alleged greenwashing on a global scale.In 2025, the State of Mississippi issued a cease and desist order related to energy collusion.\nThis pattern raises valid concerns about BlackRock’s fitness to own and operate a regulated publicutility in Minnesota.\nConclusionApproving this deal would set a dangerous precedent — putting Wall Street profit motives ahead of\nMinnesota families, small businesses, and environmental justice. The risks are too great, thebenefits too vague, and the track record of the buyer too troubling.\nI respectfully urge the Commission to follow the recommendation of Administrative Law Judge\nMegan J. McKenzie and reject the proposed sale of Allete to GIP / BlackRock.\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nDear Members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission,\nI am writing in reference to PUC Docket No. 24-198 to state my opposition to the proposed\ntakeover of Minnesota Power by BlackRock.Minnesota Power plays a critical role in serving the energy needs of our communities,\nsupporting regional industries, and maintaining reliability across northern Minnesota. Controlof this vital utility should remain accountable to the people of our state—not to a globalinvestment firm whose primary obligation is to its shareholders.\nA takeover of this nature raises serious concerns:\nLocal accountability and oversight:  Decisions affecting Minnesota’s energy future\nmust remain under the guidance of a utility rooted in and responsive to the communities\nit serves.\nLong-term stability: Private equity or investment firms often focus on short-termreturns, which can come at the expense of necessary long-term infrastructureinvestments and ratepayer protections.\nEnergy independence and affordability: Minnesotans cannot risk higher rates,reduced service reliability, or a diminished focus on renewable energy development as aresult of profit-driven priorities.\nFor these reasons, I urge the Commission to reject this proposed acquisition. Minnesota Powershould remain under ownership and direction that prioritize the interests of its customers,employees, and the future energy needs of Minnesota.\nThank you for your consideration.Respectfully,\nTodd Murchison1105 S 3rd Ave E Ely, MN 55731651.304.0345\nFrom: Randall Barlow\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: Blackrock acquiring Minnesota power\nDate: Wednesday, September 24, 2025 6:26:28 AM\n[You don't often get email from randallbarlow9749@icloud.com.

But once that is done those promises will go away and the rules will be lobbied away.  We werepromised many things but after the failed attempt and reporters getting access to internal emails through FOIArequests the plan the entire time was to enrich a few people in the C-suite and lay off about half the workforce. Ihave no doubt in my mind that Blackrock is probably using a similar playbook.  Utilities are a monopoly bygeography and as such should never be privatized. Giving up control of electricity or water infrastructure to aprivate company will always come back to haunt you. Just looking at Texas and the problems they have shouldshow you that private industry should not control utilities.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nTo the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission,\nI am writing to urge the Commission to reject the merger between Allete and BlackRock onThursday, 9/25/25.\nWhen I moved to Northern Minnesota in 2024, I was proud to build a home here. To join a\nstate that values its people, communities, and natural resources during my young adult life leftlike a dream. But, with the proposed Allete–BlackRock merger, that pride has started to fade.\nTurning over control of our utilities to one of the world’s largest Wall Street firms feels like a\nbetrayal of what makes Minnesota strong: local accountability, transparency, and acommitment to the common good. This merger risks shifting priorities away from affordablerates, clean energy progress, and community benefits, but toward distant shareholders.\nI did not choose to build my life here only to see our future energy decisions handed off to\nglobal investors who have no stake in our towns, our environment, or our everyday struggleswith utility bills and energy conservation.\nMinnesotans deserve a utility system that puts people, affordability, and clean energy first.\nAllowing this merger would make it harder for regulators and citizens to hold the companyaccountable to those values.\nI am very disappointed that this deal has moved so far forward. It shows that the Committee\nvalues profits and quotas before their citizens, which is heartbreaking to hear as a previouslyproud Duluthian.\nI respectfully ask the Commission to say no to this merger and protect the long-term interests\nof Minnesota residents.\nSincerely,Jonah Provance, a young Duluth Citizen.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nTo whom it may concern,\nAs a resident of northern Minnesota, I urge you  to reject the acquisition of Minnesota Power by\nBlackRock. We simply can’t afford to have another essential part of our lives sold off to private\nequity. \nIn their quest for excessive profits, private equity interests are hurting the most important parts of\nour lives: Private equity makes finding an affordable place to live even harder for working people.\nPrivate equity erodes our health and care system, closing hospitals and care facilities and\nundermining quality. Private equity puts the cost of educating our kids that much farther out of\nreach for those already struggling. \nAnd now private equity is coming for our utilities, the services that provide our electricity, heat, and\nwater that we need to survive. \nWe know that private equity hurts public life by consolidating financial wealth and political power\ninto the hands of the few, skewing the one voice, one vote promise of a democratic governance.\nAt a time when corporate greed has a stronghold on the outcomes of elections and public decision\nmaking across our country, Minnesota’s leaders must push back and reclaim a governance for the\npeople, by the people. Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Megan J. McKenzie issued a report including findings of fact and\nconclusions of law with a recommendation that the Commission deny the proposed buyout. The\nALJ found that the proposed acquisition of ALLETE, Inc., parent company of Minnesota Power, by\nGlobal Infrastructure Partners and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is not only\ninconsistent with the public interest but that, if approved, the deal would result in net harm. \nThe record shows that this proposed private equity buyout would only do harm to Minnesotans. I\nurge you to protect the people and set an example for the rest of the country by denying this\nproposal.\nSincerely,\nKristen Wesloh\n9943 E.

We are very pleased to  share that the Company \nand Partners have agreed to a set of commitments t hat includes the large majority of the \nCommissioners’ additional Decision Opti ons.

To that end, Attachment A  to this filing \nreflects agreement by the following parti es and stakeholders on proposed Decision \nOptions and overall resolution of this proceeding: \n Minnesota Power; \n The Minnesota Department of Commerce (“Department”); \n Global Infrastructure Partners;  \n Canada Pension Plan In vestment Board;  \n Energy CENTS Coalition; \n International Brotherhood of El ectrical Workers Local 31; \n IUOE Local 49 and NCSRCC; \n LiUNA Minnesota and North Dakota;  \n Fresh Energy;  \n Clean Grid Alliance;  \n Center for Energy and Environment; and  \n Clean Energy Economy Minnesota. \n \nThrough the commitments in the Settl ement and the additional commitments \noutlined in Attachment A , the Partners have agreed to provide more than $100 million in \nrate credits and investor-funded investments for customers, in addition to a one-year rate \ncase stay-out. \nAttachment B  to this filing identifies how agr eed Decision Options in Attachment \nA differ from proposed Commissioner Decision Options and provides explanations for modifications where we believe such explan ation may be helpful to the Commission. The \nCompany, Partners, and Department  confirm that to the extent  their agreement in this \nfiling to a Decision Option would constitute a modification of the Settlement Agreement \nbetween them, they would accept the modifi cations included in this letter without \notherwise withdrawing fr om the Settlement. \nMinnesota Power, along with GIP and CPP Inve stments, also reached out to each \nof the Office of the Attorney General-Residential Utilit ies Division, Citiz ens Utility Board \n(MN), CURE, Sierra Club, and Large Power Inte rvenors to determine whether they would \nsupport approval of the Acquisition or ot herwise modify their positions should the \nCommission adopt any combination of the new Commissioner Decision Options.  These \nparties each stated that they would not support the Acquisiti on, and that the Commission’s \nnew Decision Options would not affect their opposition to the Acquisition.  \n  \nDocusign Envelope ID: F2DCA372-1B8D-4F45-B79C-EDF960A715DD\nMs. Bergman \nSeptember 24, 2025 Page 3  \n3 We appreciate the careful attention and dedica tion of time to this important matter \nby the Commission and Commission Staff.

Staff:  Require Minnesota Power to file in this docket a n annual quarterly report \ndocumenting any adjustments to the 5-year capital  investment plan, with an explanation of why \nthe adjustments are reasonable, prudent, and consis tent with the goals of Settlement Stipulation \nParagraphs 1.3–1.4 to ensure the availability of investment funds and the enforceability of the \ncapital commitment.  Further require that Minnesota Powe r make an interim report, providing \nthe same information, if there are any adjustments to the 5-ye ar capital investment plan between \nannual reports.  \nExplanation of Proposed Changes: Minnesota Power’s 5-year cap ital investment plan \nis updated on an annual basis. While the Co mpany does not oppose quarterly reports, \nmost of them would likel y identify no change to th e annual update. The proposed \nmodifications to this Decision Option are intended to provide reporting on a cadence that will provide the information requested without resulting in additional filings that \ndo not contain useful information.  \n13A. Staff:  Delegate authority to  Direct the Executive Secretary to modify the ALJ report as \nspecified herein and to otherwise modify, reject, or add any fi ndings or conclusions , including \nincorporating modificati ons proposed by Minnesota Power, th e Partners, the Department, ECC, \nand LIUNA as needed to ensure the fi ndings of fact of  the Commission are consistent with the \nCommission’s decisions.  \n \n4 The Minnesota Department of Commerce takes no position on Decision Option 19. \n5 While the Resolving Parties do not object to Decision Option 21, they believe it is addressed by Paragraphs 1.40 and \n1.41 of the Settlement. \nDocusign Envelope ID: F2DCA372-1B8D-4F45-B79C-EDF960A715DD\nAttachment B  \nDocket No. E015/PA-24-198 \n \n2 Commissioner Decision Options \nThe Resolving Parties support adoption of Co mmissioner Decision Options 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, \n29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, and 39A-D as with modifications described herein. \nHam New 23 . Minnesota Power’s rate of return  on equity is capped at 7.25309.78 percent (as \napproved in Docket No. E-015/GR-23-155) and Minnesota Power’s equity ratio in its capital \nstructure will be capped at 53.0 percent until December 31st, 2030. This  condition does not prohibit \nMinnesota Power from filing new rate cases  or from proposing in rate cases what an ROE would \nbe absent the temporary cap . The Commission may reduce the rate of return on equity by up to \n100 basis points if it finds any significant viol ation of conditions imposed in this docket.  \nExplanation of Proposed Changes: Custome rs are already protected by Settlement \nParagraph 1.12 from potential increases in the cost of debt as a result of the \nAcquisition. It is reasonable for the Company  to have the opportunity to demonstrate \nthat any increases in the cost of debt are caused by forces outside of its control, such \nas interest rates and tariffs. The Company and Partners agree, however, to a cap to \nMinnesota Power’s last-authorized ROE,  which does not change the Settlement \nestablishing a lower ROE of 9.65 percent until the Company’s next rate case. Petitioners also agree to a fix ed equity ratio to  further address c oncerns about over-\nleveraging the Company. The additional proposed modifications seek to reflect that (1) \nthe Company and Partners are not agreeing that market conditions will dictate any \nparticular ROE for the next five years; and (2) violation of conditions could be \npenalized in the form of reductions to inves tor returns, apart from the cost of debt. \nHam New 24 . Until the end of fiscal year 2030, ALLETE shall file with the Minnesota Public \nUtilities Commission any and all relevant information required under Securities and Exchange \nCommission rules which were applicable when ALLETE was publicly traded. The Commission \ndelegates authority to the Executive Secretary to  approve or modify the Company’s plan for \ncompliance with this requirement, and such plan sh all be filed with the Executive Secretary within \n30 days after the close of the Acquisition.  \nExplanation for Proposed Change: The Company  proposes to work with the Executive \nSecretary to facilitate its compliance with this requirement. The word “relevant” was \nadded to clarify that the Executive Secretary wi ll determine information that is relevant \nfor purposes of the filings. For example, there will no longer be public stock and, thus, while the Securities and Exchange Commission requires certain information related to \nthe trading of public stock, no such info rmation will exist after the Acquisition. \n \nHam New 25 . The Minnesota Department of Commerce managed shall be gi ven the opportunity \nto review and approve the scope of work and revi ew and ask questions related to the audit report \nof ALLETE’s annual financial statement audit by an independent third party registered accounting \nfirm, prior to the finalization of the audit report, to ensure that the audit will be (as to scope) and \nwas (as to the audit report) conducted in accordan ce with auditing standard s generally accepted in \nthe United States of America (“US GAAS”) until the end of fiscal year 2030.

ALLETE shall f ile the result with the \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission. \nExplanation for Proposed Change: In recogn ition that the Company’s annual audit is \nconducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, whic h is governed by auditors’ duties of \nindependence, integrity, and other ethica l standards, the Company and Department \nhave coordinated to determine an appropria te and manageable scope of Department \noversight. \nHam New 26 (unchanged) .

Within 30 days of the Order, \nMP shall file a plan assuring that this commitment is legally enforceable between MP and the \nPartners and irrevocable until fulfilled, even if the Partners sell the Company. The Commission delegates authority to the Executive Secretary to approve this plan if no party files an objection \nwithin 20 days of MP’s filing. A dditionally, MP shall file a proposal for distributing the bill credits \neither in its next rate case  or in a petition by February  1, 2026, whichever is earlier. \nSieben New 28 (unchanged except as to IRP docket timing).

Minimize the size and capacity factor of natural gas resources added to \nminimize the risk of stranded assets for Minnesota Power customers.  \niii. Include clean firm capacity to be funded by the $50 million Clean Firm Fund \ncommitment. The filing shall include details on how Minnesota Power plans to use the Fund including the size and type of  the resource(s) to be developed, why \nthe proposed resources are the best use of this Fund, in-service date(s) for \nproposed resources, and additional funding or financing sources being pursued, \nas applicable.  \nDocusign Envelope ID: F2DCA372-1B8D-4F45-B79C-EDF960A715DD\nAttachment B  \nDocket No. E015/PA-24-198 \n \n4 B. As ordered in the 2023 IRP, Docket No. E-015/RP-21-33, Minnesota Power shall file \nin the current IRP Docket amended affiliat ed interest agreements and updated capacity \ndedication amounts for the Nemadji Trail En ergy Center (NTEC), and parties may \nanalyze whether that amount of NTEC capacity  is in the public and ratepayer interest. \nMinnesota Power shall make the affiliated interest agreement fi ling by October 15, \n2025 in the IRP Docket, and cross-file it in  the NTEC affiliated interest agreement \ndocket, No. E-015/AI-17-568. \nExplanation for Proposed Change: The limited modification proposed here is intended \nto add timing flexibility for parties to th e IRP Docket.

Alloy Parent shall make $2 million instal lments to the Weatherization Fund annually, \nbeginning January 1, 2026, until the $10 milli on commitment is fulfilled.

Energy savings and the associated net bene fits achieved through the Weatherization \nFund are not eligible to be included in th e calculation of Minnesota Power’s Energy \nConservation and Optimization utility financial incentive.  \nE. The objective of the Weatherization Fund is to reduce space and water heating and \ncooling loads in participa ting homes.

To hear that Black Rock is trying to buy out our PUBLIC utilities, I.E.Minnesota power, is an absolutely atrocious thought. In a world of massive corporations andgreed we need to keep power and utilities in the hands of the people that live here. It should beillegal for a massive corporation like Blackrock to own something like that. \nPlease, I'm urging you, do NOT transfer ownership to them or any other big money interests.\nLet's keep decision making in the hands of our state and keep power affordable for thenorthland. \nSincerely and with deepest respect,\nTimothy Comfort\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Such a largeentity cannot have the best interest of Minnesotans in mind as they buyup utilities. Every time an investment firm buys one it always ends upin higher prices for customer at a time when none can afford such. Inperfect world all utilities would be publicly owned but I realize wedon't live in such a world, still several smaller companies owningutilities will always be preferable to one large company when it comesto outcomes for the customers. In addition I highly doubt a company with\nsuch large investments in fossil fuels will truly work toward the goal\nof having all our energy coming from renewable resources.\nThanks for taking the time to list to me ramble,Jeff Tribby\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nTo whom it may concern, \nI am a Duluth resident and I work for a major petrochemical firm.  I have seen what privateequity buyout has done to one of my customers, Kohler engine, now known as Rehlko. They've requested lower prices on all products, which means in some cases lower qualitylubricants and more work for us to try and source these items.  They are very obviously tryingto squeeze all the profit margin they can out of Kohler to try and maximize short term profitand run the company into the ground.  With BlackRock purchasing MN Power, I expect ourrates to double if not more, which will make electricity unaffordable and I will be forced to gooff grid, and I live in the city of Duluth.  I am financially well off and own my own home.

As a life-longDuluth resident, I rely on the safe, affordable electricity provided by Allete. Allete has alsobeen a major sponsor of our local symphony, a group that my husband has played in for over20 years. Is the name on the stage going to change from Allete to Black Rock? I'd about passout. Not selling to Black Rock won't hurt them at all. Selling to them will hurt our people verymuch with the inevitable rise in rates and loss of local control and transparency. If the patternholds, the capital provided by them will be in the form of loans that will fall to the customersto repay, not Black Rock. This is the Before. We hold the power.

Learn why this is important\n \nHi,\n I am writing against Blackrock’s interest in acquiring Allete Energy. Their motive is clear, and a no brainer from their point of view considering their interestin ai and data centers… Step 1: find a good location near a good water source (Lake Superior) to build a datacenter  Step 2: Acquire the power supply to get control over where the majority of power goes(data center) Step 3: suck the life out of Lake Superior, have control over a local utilities monopoly,and proprietary ownership over the data of the end users.  I am a local business person. I am passionate about building local businesses andworking with other entrepreneurs to do the same. With every client interested in workingwith me, my first question is: does this exist for the betterment of my community? We as a country need to be better neighbors, and that starts with taking and maintainingcontrol of our local communities. Keeping the control in the hands of the people is whatmakes America what it is — or at least what it’s supposed to be. I hope the commission can keep that at the front of their minds and in their hearts whilemaking a decision on this matter.

I believe this transaction will not servethe people of our state well and will instead saddle us with higher utility bills, underminethe reliability of our energy supply, and erode community trust in our essential services.\nAn Administrative Law Judge concluded unequivocally that the sale “would result in net\nharm to the public interest” and poses an “unacceptable risk of rate increase and rateshock in a critical and economically vulnerable area of Minnesota.” [43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054]( https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/puc-must-unplug-\nminnesota-power-122321434.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-\n981daa162054  \"1\")\nMinnesota Power currently serves roughly 150,000 residential and business customersacross northeast and north central Minnesota.

I adamantly oppose the sale to private\nequity firms CPP and GIP.  Energy is an essential service, and I do not want it in the hands of private equitymonopolies.\nI realistically know we need rate hikes in the future to fund clean energy mandates and trust that those will be\nhandled much better and with the betterment of the community in the hands of current ownership instead ofCPP/GIP/BlackRock.  Private Equity firms have a documented history in the Upper Peninsula of raising rates morethan publicly traded utilities and of then selling to yet another private equity firm who again raised rates. NorthernWI has a citizens grassroots campaign trying to buy their utility back from private equity due to the disastrousresults.\nCommunities are strongest when essential services are owned more broadly by many in the community.  MN Power\nowns a lot of land, mineral rights, and even control over lakes and rivers that so many in our community live anddepend on.  I don’t want that ownership to transfer to private equity.\nPrivate Equity firms also have a history of just paying state level fines rather than following state mandates to\nimprove utilities for the good of the whole community. Promises made before a sale mean little when the motive ismoney, not communities. The financing schemes of monopolies and their rapid purchase of many essential servicesacross the US is frightening and is a battle this generation must take on.  Some in this community are invested inMN Power and stand to make initial money from the sale.  Do not let those be the loudest voices.  We are manypeople in the MN Power service district, and most of us have no short term gain from this proposed sale, only longterm rate hikes and loss of higher local control over our own land and essential services.\n Please stop this deal in its tracks.

Many of us are not even aware of the danger that situations like this putour futures in. At 27 years old, working as a full-time engineer, it is already difficult to try to affordmy own home, and it is even more difficult to imagine allowing large corporations like the oneattempting to purchase Allete to continue to make it less accessible. Not only will it impact the nextgeneration of home buyers and people raising children, but it will also greatly impact those whohave lived here for their entire lives. An acquisition like this serves nobody in this community, it onlyserves the greed of those at the top of these corporations looking to line their pockets with ourhard-earned money.

Private equity firms do not have a place in Minnesota, nor inpublic utilities as critical as power. The deal proposed in Docket #24-198 does NOT have theinterests of Minnesota, its people or environment, nor of Minnesota Power and those to whom itprovides utility, in mind.\nThe acquisition would be a major risk to ratepayers, as the buyers of Allete would be paying\nsubstantially over market value. The buyers are for-profit, and need to provide for shareholders; thisdirectly conflicts with the interests of ratepayers, as this premium would need to be recovered atsome point. As far as the settlement conditions detail, there are no long-term protections forratepayers, only short-term 1-year freezes on new rate requests. Private equity is volatile and rifewith financial risk that should not be present at all with public utilities. If the buyers fail to makeback their money, whether rate requests are denied or are not substantial enough to cover the over-expenses, it could jeopardize Minnesota Power, either as an entity or by lowering the quality of itsservices to cut costs. The owners may further seek to then sell the acquisition.\nIf the acquisition is approved, Allete would not be required to make public filings as would publicly\ntraded organizations. Public utility should be transparent to regulators and customers. Approvalwould reduce transparency; the petitioners have already mad extensive claims of so-called tradesecrets that further obfuscate the operation of and future plans for Allete post-acquisition.BlackRock additionally may not commit to environmental obligations, based on their priorinvestments (such as their signficant shares in fossil fuel companies) and recent leaving of Net-ZeroAsset Managers (NZAM) citing confusion over climate efforts and inquiries from public officials. Thepetitioners have already proven themselves hesitant to release information regarding the acquisitionand shown to have contradictory claims with their investments. This hesitancy and secrecy does notbode well for future transparency regarding operations of public utilities. GIP leadership isfurthermore connected to accusations of financial mismanagement regarding a solar powercompany, SunPower, with two high-level employees of GIP serving on SunPower's board. SunPowerhas been subsequently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the GIPmembers themselves subject to lawsuits related to its financial reporting.\nThe very nature of private equity directly conflicts with the interests of public utilities. They have not\nand will not serve the interests of Minnesotans or of electrical power customers. DENY this\nacquisition.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Even if I am not their direct customer, Minnesota Power is tiedinto the same transmission grid and owns a lot of generation in northern Minnesota. The decisionsmade by new private equity owners will spill over into my community one way or another.\nMy biggest concern is the environment. Cook County and northern Minnesota are some of the last\nplaces in the Midwest where you can still find real wilderness and clean water. My land is part of this.I rely on the forest and clean water here, and I worry that once private equity takes control, thoseprotections will be put second to financial returns. We are on the edge of Lake Superior, theBoundary Waters, and a forest that people come from all over the country to see. If profit becomesthe main driver, I fear decisions about dams, transmission corridors, or renewable projects will bemade without full accountability to the people who live here and depend on this land. That threatensnot just the beauty of the region but my own ability to use and enjoy my land.\nAccountability is also a major issue. Right now, Minnesota Power answers to Minnesota regulators\nand the public. If this sale goes through, decisions will be driven by investors far from here whohave no stake in our communities except the money they can make. In Ohio, we saw how utilityownership and private financial influence led to the HB6 corruption scandal, where public trust waslost and billions in costs were pushed onto ratepayers. In Indiana, private utility sales andrestructuring have led to higher bills and less local control, with profits leaving the state instead ofstaying in local communities. I don’t want Minnesota to follow those same paths.\nThis sale will also send money out of Minnesota. Instead of reinvesting earnings back into our\ncommunities, profits will be siphoned off to corporations and investors elsewhere. That means lessmoney circulating in Minnesota towns, fewer resources for local improvements, and less autonomyfor citizens. A short-term influx of cash does not outweigh the long-term loss of accountability,transparency, and economic benefit for Minnesota communities.\nFor these reasons, I urge the Commission not to approve this sale. Minnesota Power is critical\ninfrastructure. It should remain under oversight that prioritizes the public interest, not private equity\nreturns. Rejecting this sale is the only way to guarantee accountability, protect our environment, and\nkeep decision-making rooted in Minnesota.\nThank you for considering my perspective as a Cook County landowner.Best,\nJacob\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

After reviewing the record, including the Administrative Law Judge’s Findings of Fact,Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations, I believe the deal is not in the public interest. The risksto ratepayers, transparency, and Minnesota’s clean-energy goals outweigh the claimed benefits.\n1. Risk to Ratepayers / Potential Rate Increases\nThe ALJ found that Petitioners are paying a premium of roughly $1.5 billion above ALLETE’s bookvalue, and nearly 20–22% above market value at the time of the announcement (ALJ Report ¶¶ 460–465) . Such an overpayment must be recovered somehow, and history shows the costs ultimatelyflow to customers. While the settlement agreement offers temporary rate protections (e.g., a one-year freeze), the ALJ concluded these “do not address the long-term risks associated with thepremium price” (ALJ Report ¶ 472).\n2. Loss of Transparency and Oversight\nIf ALLETE is taken private, it will no longer be required to make SEC filings such as quarterly andannual reports (Form 10-Q/10-K). This eliminates a key source of visibility into operations andfinancial health (ALJ Report ¶¶ 329–333) . The record also documents extensive redactions and“trade secret” claims that limited the ability of intervenors and the public to fully evaluate Petitioners’plans (ALJ Report ¶ 335).\n3. Questionable Clean-Energy Justification\nPetitioners argue the acquisition is needed to provide capital for compliance with Minnesota’s 2040Carbon-Free Standard. The ALJ disagreed, finding Petitioners “failed to prove that the transactionmaterially improves access to capital” (ALJ Report ¶¶ 523–527) . Moreover, Minnesota Power’s ownIntegrated Resource Plan continues to propose new natural-gas generation, undermining claims that\nthe acquisition advances carbon-free goals.\n4. Private Equity Conflicts of Interest\nPrivate equity firms target returns above those typical of regulated utilities, relying on financialengineering and cost-cutting that may conflict with the public interest. Expert testimony in therecord outlined these risks (ALJ Report ¶¶ 402–410) . The experience of the Upper Peninsula PowerCompany in Michigan under private ownership — where rates rose significantly and transparencydeclined — illustrates what Minnesotans could face .\n5. Settlement Agreement Fails to Mitigate Harms\nThe Department of Commerce’s settlement agreement contains some protections, but the ALJ notedthey are largely temporary or duplicative of existing obligations and “do not fundamentally changethe risks associated with the transaction” (ALJ Report ¶ 480) .\n6. ALLETE Can Raise Capital Without the Acquisition\nIn testimony to regulators, Petitioners acknowledged ALLETE could access capital marketsindependently. The ALJ concluded the acquisition is not necessary for ALLETE to fund its resourceplan or meet Minnesota’s clean-energy law (ALJ Report ¶¶ 526–528) .\nConclusion\nMinnesota law requires that utility ownership changes serve the public interest. Here, the recorddemonstrates the opposite: higher risks of rate increases, diminished transparency, andquestionable clean-energy benefits. For these reasons, I urge the Commission to deny theacquisition.\nIf the Commission nevertheless considers conditional approval, I request binding, enforceable\nprotections including:\nLong-term (not temporary) ratepayer protections,Full transparency of financial, governance, and investment plans,Local oversight with enforceable authority,Limits on return on equity,Codified commitments consistent with the 2040 carbon-free standard, andGuarantees that infrastructure costs for private data centers are borne by the companies themselves,\nnot customers.\nMinnesotans deserve utility ownership that puts affordability, accountability, and environmental\nresponsibility ahead of private equity profit. Please protect the public interest and deny thisacquisition.\nRespectfully submitted,\nKristina Wodash\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

First, utilities should remain in public control as theymust be held accountable to local users and the local environment. We currently own property onGarden Lake outside of Ely which will be negatively affected by the purchase both environmentallyand economically. We own property at Burntstore Marina outside Punta Gorda FL and the marina hasbeen acquired by Blackstone. The result is much higher user fees and little responsiveness tocustomers.This proposed sale will also make the mineral rights and other land use more opaque. The areaserves the pristine waters of the BWCAW which also has two watersheds flowing to Hudson Bay andthrough the St. Lawrence seaway. Any harm to this environment damages ecosystems fardownstream. Keep this utility public. A solution to revenue which may be needed to upgrade facilties and makethem more sustainable and less harmful to the environment could be sold to users and the localpublic in the form of bonds. There is a much better way than allowing a nearly trillion dollarconglomerate acquire this company. I urge you to reject this sale. Thank you"

To join a state that values its\npeople, communities, and natural resources during my young adult life left like a dream. But, with the proposedAllete–BlackRock merger, that pride has started to fade.\nTurning over control of our utilities to one of the world’s largest Wall Street firms feels like a betrayal of what\nmakes Minnesota strong: local accountability, transparency, and a commitment to the common good. This mergerrisks shifting priorities away from affordable rates, clean energy progress, and community benefits, but towarddistant shareholders.\nI did not choose to build my life here only to see our future energy decisions handed off to global investors who\nhave no stake in our towns, our environment, or our everyday struggles with utility bills and energy conservation.\nMinnesotans deserve a utility system that puts people, affordability, and clean energy first. Allowing this merger\nwould make it harder for regulators and citizens to hold the company accountable to those values.\nI am very disappointed that this deal has moved so far forward. It shows that the Committee values profits and\nquotas before their citizens, which is heartbreaking to hear as a previously proud Duluthian.\nI respectfully ask the Commission to say no to this merger and protect the long-term interests of Minnesota\nresidents.\nSincerely,\nEmma Baker, a young Duluth Citizen.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

These firms are beholden only to the fattest-possible profit margins and would likely enact immediate price-hikes to affected citizen'selectrical bills, downgrade maintenance scheduling to the electrical grid to further increaseprofit margins, and divert funding away from the maintenance of the state parks that housethe waterways which power Minnesota's hydroelectric dams.\n    Minnesota Power is not the only company underneath the Allete umbrella and this\nproblem would spill onto the other energy companies (and states) involved. This would in-time eventually reach the point of a crisis not unlike (and perhaps even in more widespreadmagnitudes than) the 2021 Texas Power Crisis if this deal is approved. DO NOT APPROVE THISDEAL. Private equity WILL DESTROY PLANET EARTH if it is allowed to accrue shareholder profitfrom its demise. That is the logical conclusion to money-hoarding organizations Like BlackRockand Blackstone (though they are far from being the only firms. . .yet) This will have graveramifications for the entire United States (and the world by-proxy) should Allete's sale beapproved.

Learn why this is important\nHello PUC,\nI am writing as an extremely  concerned resident of Minnesota who spends a great deal of\ntime in and has a great deal of affection for the regions of the state covered by Minnesota\nPower. That is why I am writing today to say that the sale of Minnesota Power to BlackRockmust under no circumstances be allowed to occur\n. \nAs was shown in the ruling of Judge Megan McKenzie, the sale “ would result in net harm to\nthe public interest” likely in the form of higher costs to consumers and less accountability. \nJudge McKenzie's report stated that the buyers had displayed a “lack of cooperation” during\nthe proceedings, which raises concerns about BlackRock's trustworthiness and highlights\nthe risk that they won’t be transparent with the public if they are allowed to purchaseMinnesota Power.\nBlackRock’s $11.5 trillion in assets (larger than the GDP of every country on Earth excluding\nthe U.S. and China) make it the very definition of a company that i s too large to\nregulate . What recourse would the state of Minnesota have against a company with that\namount of wealth and power if they were to start destroying one of the most naturally beautifulregions in the state? What recourse would everyday citizens have if their rates are suddenlyraised beyond what they are able to pay, in order to satiate private equity’s endless greed? Theanswer is none. BlackRock has no stake in Minnesota, there is no way to hold them\naccountable for their promises  and therefore no sale to them should be entertained. \nIn addition to the lack of accountability, the alleged benefits of the sale are in no way\nsupported by the facts . \n1. Allete and BlackRock claim that consumers would not suffer excessive rate hikes as a result\nof the sale, but judge McKenzie disagrees. Judge McKenzie’s report stated that BlackRock is\n“planning on significant rate increases ” and that the sale “ creates an unacceptable  risk of\nrate increase  and rate shock in a critical and economically  vulnerable  area of Minnesota .”\nAs one article so eloquently put it, Minnesota’s energy future deserves better than\nBlackRock’s empty promises.\n2. Allete cited BlackRock’s “expertise” on utility infrastructure and renewable energy as areason why the sale would be beneficial. Judge McKenzie disagreed, stating that BlackRock’sexpertise “is unlikely to provide a material benefit to Minnesota Power or its ratepayers .\nAllete already has quality management and ‘near perfect’ reliability for its electric service.”\n3. Allete claims the sale will benefit Minnesota because the new partners “were intentionally\nand strategically chosen” to achieve Minnesota’s environmental goals. However, according toJudge McKenzie “the evidence shows the Partners were ultimately the only bidders for the\ncompany and were chosen based on their willingness to pay a stock premium.” \n3.a. It should be noted that BlackRock’s commitment to environmental goals isquestionable at best. As the Judge stated, “The nonpublic evidence reveals the buyers’\nintent [is] to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess ofpublic markets through company control.” BlackRock's size and capital imbue themwith the power to essentially ignore Minnesota's environmental regulations. Any feesthey would accrue would be negligible to them, and what chance does the MinnesotaState Legislature have against a firm like BlackRock?\n4. The Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota (CUB), a  party to the contested case, has\nquestioned BlackRocks ‘environmentally conscious’ image: “ BlackRock just left a coalition\naimed at aligning the asset management industry with global climate goals, causing thecoalition to suspend its activities,” it wrote. “Further, BlackRock oversees an enormousamount of shares in fossil fuel companies and has a history of opposing climate-related\nshareholder motions at these companies.”\nBlackRock is not seeking to buy Minnesota Power out of a sudden, vested interest in\nproviding safe, dependable services to our local communities. They are interested in thispurchase because they want to cash in on the soaring electricity demand from AI data centers.BlackRock is moving very aggressively to insert themselves at every level of the AI 'armsrace', from investing in data centers to software, and now even into the energy companies thatpower these data centers. They are not interested in Minnesota, they are only interested inprofit.\nElectricity is an essential service needed by all members of our community, and its\nmanagement should not be handed off to an organization with a track record like\nBlackRock’s. \nFor a look at what Minnesotans can expect if this sale is allowed to occur, we need look no\nfurther than Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The power Company UPPCO was acquired byprivate equity in 2014 and has since seen 4 rate hikes since, and has been sold to yet anotherprivate equity firm. There is nothing stopping BlackRock from doing the same in Minnesota\n.\nIf the PUC approves this sale in spite of the overwhelming  evidence against it , it would be\nanother painful example of how large industries have captured our state’s regulatory\nsystem, making the agency’s mission of “improving the lives of all Minnesotans” more of a\nslogan, and less of a reality .\nI encourage all members of the PUC to watch this video, as it sheds a great deal of light on thesituation and makes clear what a mistake it would be for the predatory BlackRock to beallowed to purchase Minnesota Power: The BlackRock Situation Just Got Worse\nAdditionally, this article\n is another valuable resource that makes plain the situation at hand.\nBest,\nMarina Norby\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Blackrock, like all privateequity, has a history of making services worse while raising prices on consumers.Additionally, with blackrock owning the mineral rights to tge land that mn power currentlyholds, they could seriously harm our state ecosystem if they decide to start mining. \nPlease don’t allow blackrock to destroy our electric grid, and keep them far away from our\nnature.\nI just called the PUC and they advised me to leave a written comment via the email found on\nyour website.

Private equity ownership does not solve Minnesota’s grid challenges; it merely shifts\ncosts onto households while extracting profit from AI-driven demand.\nAs an alternative, I submit my filed sovereign infrastructure instrument, Jo Jo Dancer’s\nGridlock™ (Vault ID: FHC-SGCI-2025-001). This proposal has been structured under\nCRA-compliant trust and valuation frameworks and has already been filed as a public\nsovereign asset. Its mechanics are as follows:\n1. Recognition – Commission acknowledgment of the proposal as a lawful, sovereign\ncustodianship instrument.\n2. Conversion – IP-to-fiat conversion executed via trust and financial underwriters (no public\nappropriation required).\n3. Activation – Direct financing of grid upgrades, wildlife-safe retrofits, and resilience\ncorridors.\n4. Recovery Streams – AI firms and data centers pay Participation Tariffs™ and\nEnvironmental Royalty Fees, not households.\n5. Outcomes – Household bills stay flat or reduced, ecological restitution is embedded, and\noutage risk is dramatically lowered.\nThis is a filed, monetizable sovereign instrument that proves Wall Street ownership is\nunnecessary. Minnesota can lead the nation in piloting custodianship models that protect\npeople, wildlife, and resilience, instead of conceding public infrastructure to private equity.\nRespectfully,\nAmethyst Amaris (Misko’o Miigizi)\nFounder & President\nFifth House of Creativity Inc.\nJurisdictional Alignment: Canada, United States (Tennessee, Georgia), global pilot corridors\n© 2025 Fifth House of Creativity Inc.

Learn why this is important\nFor:\nOffice of Governor Tim Walz & Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan\n130 State Capitol75 Rev Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.St. Paul, MN 55155\nDear Commissioners,\nI urge you to reject the proposed BlackRock/GIP acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota\nPower. Private equity ownership does not solve Minnesota’s grid challenges; it merely shiftscosts onto households while extracting profit from AI-driven demand.\nAs an alternative, I submit my filed sovereign infrastructure instrument, Jo Jo Dancer’s\nGridlock™  (Vault ID: FHC-SGCI-2025-001). This proposal has been structured under CRA-\ncompliant trust and valuation frameworks and has already been filed as a public sovereign\nasset. Its mechanics are as follows:\n1. Recognition – Commission acknowledgment of the proposal as a lawful, sovereigncustodianship instrument.\n2. Conversion – IP-to-fiat conversion executed via trust and financial underwriters (nopublic appropriation required).\n3. Activation – Direct financing of grid upgrades, wildlife-safe retrofits, and resiliencecorridors.\n4. Recovery Streams – AI firms and data centers pay Participation Tariffs™  and\nEnvironmental Royalty Fees , not households.\n5. Outcomes – Household bills stay flat or reduced, ecological restitution is embedded,\nand outage risk is dramatically lowered.\nThis is a filed, monetizable sovereign instrument  that proves Wall Street ownership is\nunnecessary. Minnesota can lead the nation in piloting custodianship models that protectpeople, wildlife, and resilience, instead of conceding public infrastructure to private equity.\nRespectfully,\nAmethyst Amaris (Misko’o Miigizi)Founder & PresidentFifth House of Creativity Inc.Jurisdictional Alignment: Canada, United States (Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia), global pilotcorridors\nCopyright & Legal Notice\n© 2025 Fifth House of Creativity Inc.

If run for private gain, our communities face higher costs,\nlower reliability, and less accountability.
