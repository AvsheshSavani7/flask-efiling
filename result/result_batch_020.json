Robert Street  \nSaint Paul, MN 55164  \n \nMr. Will Seuffert  \nExecutive Secretary  \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission  \n121 7th Place East, Suite 350  \nSt. Paul, MN 55101    \nRE: Comments in the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners (Docket 24 -198)  \n \nJudge McKenzie and Mr. Seuffert,  \n On behalf of the 70,000 skilled construction workers represented by the unions affiliated with \nthe Minnesota Building and Construction Trades Council, I am writing to share our support for \nthe proposed purchase of ALLETE, Inc. by infrastructure investment funds managed by the \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners. We support the transaction because we believe it is the best path for Minnesota Power to secure the capital \nneeded to build a safe, reliable and increasingly carb on-free grid using local union labor.  \n \nThe men and women represented by the Minnesota Building Trades have counted on \nMinnesota Power to provide affordable, reliable power and economic opportunity in Northeast \nMinnesota for more than 100 years. During that time, the company’s ownership structur e has \nchanged, but the commitment to customers and union workers has not.  \n \nThe first question Minnesota Building Trades and our affiliated unions asked ourselves after the \nannouncement was how a utility owned by a couple of large infrastructure fund investors might \ndiffer from one owned by Wall Street stockholders. Based on our i nitial review of the proposal \nand our experience with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, we came to the conclusion \nthat the sale would have no impact on the way Minnesota Power operates on a day -to-day \nbasis, while greatly strengthening the utility ’s capacity to attract capital and support badly -\nneeded economic growth in its service territory.  \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST. PAUL,  MN 55102     •      TEL (651) 287- 9999     •     W ww.MnTrades .org \n \n \n \n \n Since that time, Minnesota Building Trades unions and members have participated in either the \ncontested case proceedings or the public hearings, and nothing any of them have seen or heard \nto date has weakened our conclusion that the sale is in the best interest of customers and \nworkers. While we know that change can be scary, nothing about the transaction affects the ability of the Public Utilities Commission to set rates and allowed capital structures, or to \napprove or deny investment on the front end or r ate and rider recovery on the back end. The \ncontrols in place after the transaction will be the same as those that exist today, as will the financial incentive to meet the expectations and requirements established by the Legislature \nand Public Utilities Co mmission.  \n \nIt’s no secret why ALLETE pursued a private acquisition after more than seven decades as a \npublicly -traded company. In 2023, the State of Minnesota required every utility serving \nMinnesota customers to achieve 100% carbon -free power by 2050. For Minnesota Power, \nwhich relies heavily on coal- fired power despite the utility’s leadership in renewable \ngeneration, meeting that mandate means unprecedented investment in transmission, \nrenewable generation, batteries and other low - and zero -carbon technology. The sc ale of \nneeded investment is far beyond anything ALLETE has done in the past or is capable of doing as a stand -alone company  \n \nThe elected leaders of Minnesota’s Building Trades unions understand the challenge, because \nthey sit on boards that manage hundreds of billions of dollars in pension fund assets and are \naffiliated with international unions that collectively invest more than $500 billion in stocks, bonds, infrastructure, real estate and over investment vehicles. We recognize that a $6 billion \ncompany seeking an additional $5 billion in capital over just five years looks like a potentially \nrisky proposition even before considering Minnesota Power’s unique exposure to risks \nassociated with ebb and flow of mining activity.  \n \nThe Minnesota Building Trades supported Minnesota’s 100% clean energy when it passed in \n2023, despite the fact that achieving the mandate will impact the livelihood of members who \nmaintain coal -fired power plants and other legacy infrastructure. For this r eason, it has been \ndisappointing to see a number of organizations and institutions that say they support climate \nprogress oppose the transaction without providing any realistic alternative for financing \nMinnesota Power’s clean energy transition.  \n \nWe are especially troubled by claims that the utility could meet the need for additional capital \nby relying more on customers, third -party providers or other utilities as suggested by the  \n \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST. PAUL,  MN 55102     •      TEL (651) 287- 9999     •     W ww.MnTrades .org \n \n \n \n \n Department of Commerce, Office of the Attorney General and others. While some have tried to \nstir up opposition to the acquisition by inaccurately describing the transfer of a utility from one  \nset of private investors to another as “privatization,”\n1 the real threat of deregulation and \nprivatization comes from the outsourcing of the utility’s obligation to serve to third parties that \nare not fully under the control and oversight of the Public Utilities Commission.  \n \nMinnesota Power employs all of the tools suggested by parties concerned about the transaction \ntoday to provide the Public Utilities Commission with a full set of options, and to provide \ncustomers with the best value. Minnesota Power regularly solicits thir d-party bids for energy \ngeneration, encourages residential customers to install rooftop solar and partners with utilities \nlike Great River Energy to build and finance transmission projects. But in each case the utility’s \ncapability of delivering these projects on its own helps to ensure that the priorities of the \nutility’s customers are not subordinated to the interests of third parties.  \n \nMinnesota Power has already experienced the limitations of even modest levels of reliance on \nthird parties. The utility struggled for years to develop a demand response product that was \nacceptable to both large industrial customers and the Public Utilities  Commission due to the \ncost of compensation that customers expected in exchange for curtailing their demand.  \n \nSimilarly, Minnesota Power saw its plan for development of solar generation in the service \nterritory delayed when the low -bidder Cypress Creek failed to deliver the 10 MW Blanchard \nSolar project because the company was unable to secure site control. The ut ility’s solar \nrequirement was only met when Minnesota Power filed a 20 MW self- build proposal, and we \nexpect the Commission to shortly approve an additional 200 MW of self- built solar in Cohasset \nand Royalton as the best option to meet the need identified in the current Integrated Resource Plan.  \n \nIf Minnesota Power is unable to secure adequate capital to continue proposing utility -financed \nprojects or to do so cost -effectively, customers and the public interest will suffer in important \nways. The potential consequences of a capital shortage are pote ntially severe. Capital shortfalls \ncould create deployment delays that could threaten the utility’s ability to meet requirements, \nmaintain reliability and/or take advantage of favorable market conditions and avoid \nunfavorable conditions. Further capital shortfalls will almost certainly result in higher costs for \ncustomers by reducing competition and giving third parties more leverage to extract premiums \nin cases where the utility could have provided a more cost -effective option.  \n \n1 https://curemn.org/blog/take -the-power -back/   \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST. PAUL,  MN 55102     •      TEL (651) 287- 9999     •     W ww.MnTrades .org \n \n \n \n \n Workers will also suffer from capital constraints, first, as a result of project cancellations and \ndelays; and second, because capital shortfalls will limit Minnesota Power’s ability to set and  \nenforce requirements that advance the workers’ interests and the state’s values. A decade ago, \nlarge wind and solar energy projects built to serve Minnesota utilities created very few jobs for \nunion or local workers, as documented by North Star Policy Inst itute and Local Jobs North \nbecause the third- party developers responsible for construction hired contractors that relied \nheavily on non -union out- of-state workforce.\n2  \n \nToday, similar projects are creating hundreds of jobs for union and local workforce, in large part \nbecause utilities like Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power began to simultaneously pursue more \nself-build projects, and to make use of local and/or union labor a  requirement for Power \nPurchase Agreement providers that were previously reluctant to make any such commitments. Neither utility could have moved the market without having the option of building their own projects if third -party providers balked. The same is true for efforts to increase participation of \npeople of color, women and veterans in the workforce and as vendors, which have made much greater strides through utility -owned than through third -party -owned projects.  \n \nThe dynamic is even worse for customer- owned generation, where the state’s values in the \narea of fair compensation, respect for workers’ rights, and workforce inclusion play little or no \nrole, because neither the utility nor the Public Utilities Commission  can easily tell customers \nhow to build their own projects. As a result, industries such as rooftop solar installation are dominated by low -wage work and lack the sort of inclusive career pathways adopted by \nBuilding Trades unions. Given the poor economies  of scale associated with most distributed \ngeneration projects, increasing Minnesota Power’s reliance on them would push up rates, transfer wealth from lower to higher -income customers best able to take advantage of these \nprograms, and exchange high -qualit y jobs on utility -scale projects for lower- quality jobs on \ndistributed projects.  \n \nIt is clear to us that approval of the proposed transaction will bring significant benefits to \nMinnesota Building Trades members in the form of more and lower- cost investments in job -\ncreating projects, coupled with preservation of the utility’s ability to provide the capital needed \nto provide safe, reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean power. On the other hand, a \ndecision to deny approval could have damaging consequences, destroying job opportunities on  \n \n \n2 https://northstarpolicy.org/catching- the-wind -the-impact -of-local -vs-non-local -hiring- practices -on-construction -\nof-minnesota -wind -farms/ ; https://www.localjobsnorth.org/reports   \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST.

Learn why this is important\nCommissioners,\n I’m writing regarding the proposed acquisition of ALLETE by Global Infrastructure Partners andCanadian Pension Plan Investment Board.  In listening to and reading other public comments thereappears to be a significant amount of misinformation and misconceptions about this sale.  \nCommenters have cited concerns about local control of the utility.  The utility in its currentform has limited local control, of its ten-member Board of Directors, six of them reside outsideof Minnesota and nearly 74% of ALLETE shares are held by institutional investors.  As a whole,voting shareholders approved this transaction by a 97% margin on August 21, 2024.  Thecompany’s core function is to create shareholder profit by providing safe and reliable electricservice, this will be the case whether those shareholders are the current controlling majority ofinstitutional investors, or GIP and CPP. \nCommenters have given credit to Minnesota Power for their community involvement in thecommunities they serve, while also expressing concerns about whether those activities willcontinue.  As Minnesota Power’s community service and involvement are a function of themdoing business in those communities, it is likely this involvement will continue whether thecompany is owned by its current shareholders or GIP/CPP.  In addition, Minnesota Poweremployees will continue to work and live in the communities they serve.\nCommenters have cited concerns about employees.  The company has been reducing staffthrough attrition for decades, particularly its unionized workforce.  IBEW Local 31 was able tonegotiate, and their membership approved a two-year extension of the existing laboragreement with reasonable wage increases, which would not have happened without thepending sale.  Many people have commented that there are no employment guaranteesbeyond the contract extension: this is completely true, just as it will also be true if thetransaction doesn’t go through, or if the extension didn’t happen.  Local 31 has had difficultnegotiations in the past and will likely have difficult negotiations in the future regardless ofwhether the company is owned by its current shareholders, or GIP/CPP.  Based on pastexperiences it isn’t the shareholders that have paid the price when the company has navigateddifficult financial times.  That burden was largely shouldered by employees and ultimatelyratepayers.  Employees in the form of layoffs, attrition, and reduced compensation andbenefits.  Ratepayers in the form of deferred infrastructure maintenance leading to highercosts later on, and service reliability issues. \n \nIt is in everyone’s best interest to have a financially stable electric utility; this acquisition will provide\nneeded financial assurances to maintain existing infrastructure and service reliability.  For thesereasons, I am in support of the proposed transaction. Sincerely, Will KeyesCotton, MN"

Providingelectrical power to the Twin Ports, Iron Range and North Shore communities is a necessary publicservice. And while those providing that service have a right to make a profit from doing so, thefarther away from Duluth ownership moves, the greater the chances the commitment to providingthis service gets overlooked in a push for higher profits or that the company becomes victim toneglect and a poorer quality of service is provided. Additionally, this community has a commitmenttoward sustainability that has been growing stronger and is just beginning to be reflected in theoperations of our local electric company. I believe this sale would endanger this bit of progress thathas been made.\nFrom: beth.hynesciernia@everyactioncustom.com  on behalf of Beth Hynes-Ciernia\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: Reject the ALLETE/MN Power acquisition by Canada PPI Board & GIP (BlackRock) / PUC Docket Number 24-198\nDate: Thursday, April 10, 2025 2:36:07 PM\n[You don't often get email from beth.hynesciernia@everyactioncustom.com.

This acquisition is not consistent with the public interest.\nBig private equity investors desire profits, that’s their only reason for being. This is inconsistent with the need to\nprovide Minnesota Power customers and communities with the affordable, reliable, clean, and safe electricity we allneed. Minnesotans have shown over and over again that we value clean water, air, and energy.\nI am concerned because this sale would:\n- Reduces public transparency and accountability by removing many requirements for disclosing information about\nthe company’s finances and business plans- Creates uncertainty in future employment for a large number of Minnesota Power’s employees- Puts Minnesota’s ability to meet its clean energy goals in the hands of far-off, wealthy investors who have myriadfossil fuel investments and have shown little commitment to cost-effective climate action\nIn fact, BlackRock oversees an enormous amount of shares in the fossil fuel industry and has a history of opposing\nclimate-related shareholder motions at these companies.\nIf this Commission is truly looking out for the best interests Minnesota Power customers, Minnesotans across the\nstate, and the public as a whole, it needs to reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by the CanadaPension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).\nSincerely,\nBeth Hynes-CierniaMinneapolis, MN 55407-2207beth.hynesciernia@gmail.com\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

I live in Duluth,MN and will be affected by the sale. \nI have many concerns regarding the sale of MN Power to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Boardand Global Infrastructure Partners, which is owned by BlackRock if it is allowed. 1. With everything that is happening with the tariffs and retaliation, selling our electric company to anon-US based firm is concerning. Living in a cold climate where electricity is essential for heat andsurvival it should be protected. 2. I lived in Alaska (am on the state’s Pioneer Registry) where I witnessed first hand the negativeenvironmental impacts of powerful large businesses for the sake of increased profit. Their promisesmeant nothing, the damage to the environment was done before it could be stopped and theenvironment will never be able to totally recover. Northern Minnesota has similar environmentalareas that we all need to protect. The world's biggest private equity firm, may value making moremoney over the environment. 3. During COVID, Canadian based company (PCL Construction) closed their Minnesota offices andlaid off the employees without notice, without a severance package and only 1 days notice ofinsurance coverage at a time when medical insurance was most needed. They did not supportMinnesota during COVID, why would we trust our electric utility to a non-US based company???Canada has different regulations than the US, how would our electricity be protected?Electricity is an essential utility that we do not have other options if they choose to raise rates orstop services, and should be protected. I hope the sale is stopped to protect our right to having an essential utility, electricity, whileprotecting the environment.

E-015/PA-24-198\nLeave a comment on the docket. *\nI am a current ALLETE, Inc. employee. \nAfter listening to the public hearings held during the week of 4/7 to 4/11/25, there seemed to be\ntwo main recurring comments/concerns from individuals as well as intervenors about transparencyand rate increases. I think it is important for the commission to remember that even after theacquisition ALLETE will remain a regulated utility having to follow the current process of rateincreases through transparent rate cases as well as continuing to file numerous public reportsthroughout the year. ALLETE will still be required to file quarterly and audited annual FERC reports,the annual Minnesota Jurisdictional report, monthly and annual EIA-861 reports, and others. Theseare financial reports that ALLETE currently files and will continue to be required to file. \nIndividuals and intervenors were also worried about rate increases, which is understandable no one\nlikes to pay more but with or without the acquisition there will be rate increases. Even if everythingstayed the same at ALLETE there would need to be rate increases because each and every yearexpenses go up with inflation, whether you are an individual, a small business, or a public utility.We've all seen it, expenses get more expensive each and every year no matter what. Rate increaseswill happen regardless of the acquisition as ALLETE continues to invest in meeting the states 2040carbon free standard. The acquisition won't change the process of rate cases, ALLETE will still berequired to go through the same current rate change process. \nThis acquisition is in the best interest of the customers that ALLETE serves. This will acquisition will\nallow ALLETE to make the needed infrastructure investments to meet the state's 2040 carbon freestandard while stile providing safe, reliable, and affordable electricity to their customers."

These globally recognized investors bring substantial resources, ensuring access to the capital necessary to meet the state’s ambitious goal of 1 00% \ncarbon-free electric generation while preserving grid reliability. This access to capital is critical for funding vital infrastructure projects, modernizing the grid, and expanding \nrenewable energy initiatives —investments essential to supporting Minnes ota’s economic \ngrowth and environmental objectives.  \nWe recognize transparency ensured by the Public Utilities Commission’s oversight. \nALLETE/Minnesota Power’s continued reporting to the PUC should maintain the \naccountability expected of an investor -owned utility, offering assurance that this \nacquisition aligns with the public good.   \n\n A key concern  for us, especially for i nvestor -owned utilities  given their large customer \nbase , is energy affordab ility and reliability for commercial and industrial customers . These \nratepayers —from small businesses to large manufacturers—are the backbone of our state \nand local economy, especially in regions like the Iron Range. Energy  costs and reliability \ndirectly inﬂuence jobs, competitiveness, and community vitality. The long -term investment \nfrom CPP and GIP could enhance Minnesota Power’s ability to deliver reliable electricity .  \nWe would ask  the Commission to consider and to ensure that the beneﬁts of this \nacquisition  will help to keep rates affordable  for commercial industrial ratepayers who \ncomprise the majority of  customers in Minnesota Power’s service territory.  \nMinnesota Power has a strong history of meeting the needs of their customers by sharing \nthe Chamber goals of affordable , reliable , and cleaner energy. With the ﬁnancial backing \nand long -term vision of CPP Investments and GIP , coupled with the PUC’s transparent \noversight, this acquisition could strengthen the utility’s capacity to meet growing energy \ndemands sustainably. We trust the Commission will thor oughly assess these priorities to \nensure the outcome beneﬁts all stakeholders.  \nWe believe that it is in the public interest to support this acquisition to ensure sufficient \naccess to capital to meet the goals of reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy.  \nSincerely,   \n \nMichelle Benson  \nMinnesota Chamber of Commerce  \nDirector, Commerce and Utility Policy  \nmbenson@mnchamber.com  \n \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

The DNR is now claiming this line of acreage depletes water fromtrout streams when it is watered. This claim was made several decades ago, as well for anothergovernmental purpose, and land was paid to be set aside and not farmed. The trout efforts failed.The replenished streams are not capable of being a viable habitat for trout anymore. This new pushto get farmers to stop using wells on the land, unbelievably, on the very corridor of the solar panelproposal, would have farmers either farm dry on sand, or pipe water from up to six miles away at$75 a foot to lay pipe from an approved well. As farmers accept offers from the power company, and build the panels adjacent to other farmersfields, there is a danger of storms breaking the panels, or blowing the panels onto adjoining fieldsand shattering on the fields. This debris makes the field unfarmable for a number of years. Thedamaged or no longer useful panels are not recycleable. Isn’t this trash an issue for the environmentjust like our windmills have become? Like our carbon footprint is? We are smart enough to create artificial intelligence, can’t we find a way to create a clean energy thatwon’t force farmers out of their vocations? Pollute the environment in a different way? Do we pay forenergy with higher food prices? What about nuclear energy? I don’t care for the strong arm efforts topush around farmers, raise prices on energy that are already exorbitant to make something happenby 2040 with an outdated solar power system. My dad winters in Texas for 3 months during winter, and he shuts his home (built of logs in 1994)down except to keep it at 55 degrees farenheit. Everything else is unplugged. His electricity billhovers at $80.00 a month! That is ridiculous! The heat isn’t even electric, it is just a matter ofswitching on the furnace! And they want to raise the price of service?! There is something wronghere. Please look into this. Thank you.

Their core obligation is to maximize short-term returns\nfor their investors, not to ensure long-term reliability, affordability, or equity in utility services.Across the country, we’ve seen what happens when public or quasi-public assets—especially utilities—fall into private equity hands: asset stripping, diminished services, rate hikes, and eventual resaleor closure. This business model undermines the stability and public accountability we rely on inessential services like electricity.\nUtilities are not regular businesses; they are critical infrastructure. Minnesotans depend on\naccessible, stable power—not speculative financial maneuvers designed to enrich billion-dollar firmsheadquartered far from the communities they serve. Allowing this sale would prioritize private profitover public interest.\nFurthermore, the long-term risks of this acquisition include:\n• Reduced investment in infrastructure and maintenance to increase margins• Rate increases passed on to consumers to satisfy return-on-equity demands• Loss of local control and transparency• Workforce reductions and outsourcing• Compromised climate and renewable energy goals\nI urge the PUC to block this sale and preserve public oversight of our utility services.

Learn why this is important\nHello,\n I’m hoping someone will actually read this, but I’m a 36 year employee of Minnesota Power,and I’m in full support of the Sale.  There is so much mis information about how Allete can justturn back the clock, and be the company they were in 1980 all over again, but realistically, thebest way to move forward with the capital investment we have to make, is to have this sale gothrough. The leaders here at Allete have always made very good decisions in regards to thehealth of the company, and Bethany and her leadership team is no different.  They have donethe homework, and to be fiscally responsible, and environmentally sound, we need to havethis sale go through successfully.

Learn why this is important\nHello,\nI have been, am currently, and strongly intend to be a resident of Minnesota for my whole life,\nand care deeply about the environment of our beautiful state, as well as the power that heatsour homes when the environment is perhaps a bit less than beautiful (namely the -40 degreedays). I am a recent college graduate and hope to eventually buy a home here, and pay powerbills like everyone else. I'm writing this because I don't believe the sale of ALLETE to privatecompanies is a good idea. My reasoning for this is primarily due to all the questions that Ihave regarding the sale and how many of those questions are both important and have very,very unclear answers. The primary one is this: if two large investment firms (one owned byBlackRock) buy ALLETE for a very substantial amount of money, how will they make theirmoney back? We can regulate how much they charge for utilities but ALLETE's revenue ismade up by 81% of these regulated utilities. If we demand that they keep costs low forMinnesota residents what else will they do apart from refuse to invest in Minnesota power? InMinnesota power is a vital resource, we are not like Texas where if power goes out for acouple days in bad weather it will be fine because the snow will melt soon. If power outageshappen there is no mild weather respite, it will be deadly. This push for profits also will runcontrary to the environmental goals Minnesota has set for our power sources. WhileBlackRock's CEO may have said that they want to start moving to eco-friendly power options,I trust a billionaire about as far as I can throw their $11.5 trillion in assets. That commitmentto the environment will only be true for as long as it remains profitable, and the second that itisn't it won't be. And Minnesota's parks and fishing and public health will be left to foot thebill. Instead of leaving the power goals of our state in the hands of a faceless corporation thathas the general attitude of a comically evil megacorp run by a supervillain, keep Minnesotapower in Minnesota. If projects need to be done, then let the state provide funding or localinterests rather than a private investment firm. Taxes or prices may go up, but at least then wewill have transparency and control over what we do and don't invest in. Considering that therate increase forecast for Minnesota Power under this deal is locked by an NDA, I think thisshows how we will be communicated with under this new ownership. \nAlso executives from one of the companies have been tied to financial misconduct and\nlawsuits for financial reporting. A strong and comforting omen for this deal surely.\nBest,\n-Carsten Doepnerhove\nFrom: Kim Buncich\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: MPUC Docket 24-198\nDate: Monday, April 14, 2025 5:45:27 PM\n[You don't often get email from kimbuncich@icloud.com.

However, if this deal is approved, all shareholders—ourselves included\n—will be forced to sell our shares. We will have no choice in the matter. That alone is deeply concerning, as it stripsaway the voice and investment of long-time employees, retirees, and individuals who believe in the company’s long-term mission and its value to Minnesota communities.\nThis $6.2 billion sale is facing well-founded opposition from a diverse coalition of stakeholders, including consumer\nadvocates, the mining and wood products industries, and the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The concerns aresubstantial and credible: increased rates for customers, loss of local control, and a lack of transparency throughoutthe process.\nGIP and CPP argue that they are better positioned to fund Allete’s renewable energy transition and infrastructure\nneeds. Yet testimony from financial and regulatory experts, including those representing the Minnesota Departmentof Commerce, disputes these claims. They cite a lack of evidence that the acquisition would improve access tocapital or benefit ratepayers in any meaningful way. In fact, the proposed transaction appears to pose significant riskof large rate increases, speculative investment strategies, and an erosion of public oversight.\nFurthermore, we are disturbed by reports that GIP and CPP have avoided transparency during these proceedings—\nrefusing to answer questions fully, providing redacted responses, and limiting meaningful public engagement. This\nlack of openness is not compatible with the trust and accountability required of a utility provider responsible forserving Minnesota homes and businesses.\nMinnesota Power is more than a utility—it’s part of the fabric of the state and the communities it serves. It should\nnot be turned over to private equity interests with global portfolios and short-term profit motives. We urge theMinnesota Public Utilities Commission and all involved regulatory bodies to reject this acquisition and preserveAllete’s accountability to the public.\nSincerely,\nKim BuncichSent from my iPad\nFrom: Larry Popovich\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: MPUC Docket Number 24-198\nDate: Monday, April 14, 2025 3:38:36 PM\n[You don't often get email from ldpops@icloud.com.

Learn why this is important\nBeth Eastman\n419 W Faribault St\nDuluth, MN  88503\nPDUC Docket No. 24-198 \n \nDear Minnesota Public Utilities Commissioners,\n \nI am writing to express my strong objections to the sale of Minnesota\nPower to a private-equity buyer, and I urge you to reject the proposed\ntransaction on the grounds that it is NOT in the public interest. In fact,\ngiven the track record of the would-be buyer, the transaction ­is likely to\nbe to the detriment of most, if not all, Minnesotans. \n \nAs a Minnesota Power customer, I am concerned about the lack of\ntransparency that BlackRock and its acquisition partner have provided\nabout their intentions toward Minnesota ratepayers and the future of\nthe power company itself.  Since, as a private-equity company,\nBlackRock—unlike Allete--has few public disclosure requirements, its\ncurrent lack of transparency is likely to become the new normal if it is\nallowed to proceed with its proposed deal.  Moreover, the vague\n“assurances” that the acquirers have made about the acquisition and its\neffect on Minnesota ratepayers are virtually unenforceable because of\nthe ridiculously lax  regulatory regime that applies to private equity.\n \nI also fear that Minnesota Power will be subject to the same strip-and-\nflip business model that has made the public equity industry so rich and\nso influential. The power company’s assets could easily be plundered by\nBlackRock and it could end up back on the market again as a much\nweaker company with far less recourse to capital markets than it has\nnow. That would indeed be ironic since its self-proclaimed difficulty in\nraising capital, of which it has provided little evidence, is the shaky\nrationale on which this proposed transaction has been constructed. \n \nIn short, this acquisition is a bad deal for Minnesotans. I urge you to\nreject it unequivocally. \n \nBeth Eastman \nBeth Eastman\nbethaeastman@gmail.com646-522-5857\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

This lake is veryimportant to the business as we offer docks with our cabin rentals. Also, as homeowners, we want tobe able to put our docks in and enjoy lake living. We encourage fishing and boating and kayakingand other water activities. If this sale goes through, I am asking the PUC to require at all times thatthe new owners never change nor let the water level go down from the high-water level all year long.Not only is it important to aquatic living, and hydro power, but it is important to those that live on,work on and enjoy the lake.

Learn why this is important\nApril 14, 2025\nPUC Docket No. 24-198Regarding the acquisition of ALLETE and specifically Minnesota Power, by Blackrock and\nCanadian Pension Plan, I am still opposed. \nI am almost 69 years old and have been a customer of MN Power for most of my life. I seldom\nworry about economically efficient reliable power being delivered to my home. It is a joy tosee their crews out and about upgrading and maintaining the electrical infrastructure.  \nPrivate equity groups such as Blackrock are notorious for selling off portions of their\nacquisitions to make a quick buck. I fear that this will happen to MN Power and that will makethem less economically efficient. I also don’t expect that MN Power’s required carbonelimination goals will be met.\nI also fear for the wages, benefits and safety of MN Power employees.Having attended the April 7, hearing at FDLTC in Cloquet, I was glad to hear that MN Power\nand their workers have agreed to a contract into 2028.  During my 5 minutes, I asked therepresentative of Blackrock about the IBEW contract in 2029. He said that that would be up toMN Power. I was surprised by that because I assumed that since the shareholders of MP werebeing bought out, that there would not be a board and governance would be top down fromthe new owners.  So, I asked the representative of MN Power of who would appoint “theboard”.  She would not or could not answer that question.\nThe lack of transparency is worrisome.  I don’t have to know everything, but I do know that\nBlackrock is not making this acquisition for egalitarian reasons. They are looking to profit andprobably a lot! I also know that our forbearers strived to make utilities affordable andresponsible, that the Public Utilities Commission works towards that end.\nA lot of folks are expecting the MN Public Utilities Commission will be overseeing much of the\noperation and that rate hikes will be kept down. Would the PUC have the time to oversee theoperations detail and ensure that efficiency was maintained? Will the PUC also be able to stop\nBlackrock from selling off a valuable piece of property that keeps MN Power efficient?\nI am going to suggest that if MN Power is going to be owned by a private group that it be\ngoverned by a board elected from the ratepayers, one bill, one vote.  That board can choose amanager and should approve labor agreements and sales of assets.  This should be similar tothe way electric co-ops are run.\nI realize that my suggestion might be audacious, but I am extremely annoyed at the lack of\ntransparency about this acquisition.\nI don’t think that there would ever be a good time for this sale to be approved but given the\noligarchic biases of the current federal government, the ignoring and deregulation oflegitimate legislative safeguards and defunding oversight agencies, there could not possibly bea worse time for this sale be approved.\nSincerely,Mike Kuitu, 1114 W 6th St. Duluth,  MN 55806\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nTo whom it may concern at the MPUC,\n My name is Eric Clement, and I have worked for Minnesota Power for over 20 years. Within that20 years I have witnessed the company transition its generation fleet from 95% coal to over50% renewable while keeping the lights on, rates low, and our employees and the public safe.Also, within that timeframe I have raised two young sons into the productive young men theyare today while volunteering within my community as a current board member and past boardchair of the United Way of NE MN, and a current executive board member for the LaurentianChamber. Without the support of Minnesota Power, I would not have been as successful orable to “Give where I live” and live our company and community values each and every day. Iam in full support of the sale. Our executive leadership has successfully navigated our fleettransition while keeping the lights on and did their due diligence to identify partners that willnot harm the company but accelerate what we are trying to do while modernizing the grid.There are many uncertainties ahead of us as we continue our goal of carbon free by 2040.Leveraging debt has become more concerning with higher rates, uncertainty in the stockmarket, rapid inflation, and a recovering supply chain. GIP and CPP have the relationships toassist with all these items especially helping ALLETE gain access to cheap capital that we willneed to continue our generation fleet transition to carbon free and improve the reliability andresiliency of our system through a grid modernization effort. Again, I am in support of the saleof the company to GIP and CPP.

This is a baddeal for Minnesota because it:\n- Risks saddling Minnesota ratepayers with higher electricity rates and less reliable and safe power service\n- Undermines the long-term stability and operational continuity of an electric utility that serves a critical public\nservice\n- Reduces public transparency and accountability by removing many requirements for disclosing information aboutthe company’s finances and business plans- Creates uncertainty in future employment for a large number of Minnesota Power’s employees- Puts Minnesota’s ability to meet its clean energy goals in the hands of far-off, wealthy investors who have myriadfossil fuel investments and have shown little commitment to cost-effective climate action\nIf this Commission is truly looking out for the best interests Minnesota Power customers, Minnesotans across the\nstate, and the public as a whole, it needs to reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by the CanadaPension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).\nSincerely,\nLinnette Werner\nSaint Paul, MN 55112-3656\nlinnette.werner@gmail.com\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

We appreciated being able to listen tostatements from citizens on both sides of this acquisition and we appreciated your professionalismand courtesy to all of us present. We listened carefully from seats near the front, took a few notes,and went home to discuss our own reactions. During the week after this hearing, before my writtenresponse, I read about both CPP and GIP/BlackRock and my areas of concern were even moreheightened, particularly having to do with the latter.\nI noticed at the hearing that most of the persons in favor of the acquisition were Minnesota\nPower/ALLETE employees and labor union members. Their expectations of past and present jobsatisfaction and their trust in future employment under new ownership were reiterated. However,there are no guarantees in two short years that their job satisfaction or even their employment willcontinue. Local control over all their employment futures will be taken away. And losing local controlof our public utilities management could have serious and cascading effects upon our entire region,the LEAST of them being a (probably guaranteed) rise in electrical rates. I confess: alarm bells go offfor me. \nVarious outside experts hired by the MN Department of Commerce and even the office of the\nAttorney General are critical of this acquisition by two huge private companies, particularly GIP.Groups such as Sierra Club, CURE, CUB, individuals and shareholders have recommended that thePublic Utilities Commission reject the deal. Both CPP and GIP’s main argument for their acquisition isthat ALLETE’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 can more easily be financially reached withthem. But neither partner is forthcoming about their real future goals. MY biggest concern is that inALLETE being owned by a private company, who knows what will happen? I have far more trust inpublic, information-sharing companies who have access to public markets. I would not mind ALLETE\nbeing in a limited partnership with CPP. (I would like to see us teaming with our Canadian\nneighbors.) I would prefer ALLETE expand its public shareholder base, rather than be absorbed by\nthe biggest profit entity in the world. (I would be willing to buy shares!) \nDo I trust GIP/BlackRock? No. I don’t, frankly. Why do they want to acquire ALLETE? I don’t believe\ntheir goal is to help Minnesota achieve net-zero carbon emissions. I have been following this week’sstories about the Panama Canal, and BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, who is determined to gain controlof Panama’s main ports. Perhaps BlackRock is more interested in the fact that we are a port, than inhelping with climate control. Maybe Fink is more interested in controlling ten percent of the world’sfresh water, or gaining mineral rights access. I do not trust this humongous, gobbling entity bent onprofit and power. \nI keep coming back to this: Potential risks to consumers and protectors of our lakes, our lands, our\nwaters, our grandchildren’s futures outweigh any potential benefits.\nLynn Tryggestad, 4101 Gladstone St., Duluth MN 55804, 218-341-7405\nAttach a File\nletter_to_juge_megan_mckenzie_re_proposed_allete_acquisition.docx\n18.13 KB  · DOCX\n I hope that the acquisition of A LLETE  by CPP and GIP will  not go forward.  \n \nMy husband David and I attended the Monday  evening , April 7, 2025 public  hearing in \nDuluth regarding the acquisition of A LLETE  by Canada Pension Plan Investment  (CPP)  and \nGlobal Infra structure  Partners (GIP),  which is owned by BlackRock .

MN Power has been a big part of electricityproduction for Northen MN for many years, and it will not benefit local customers when sold out ofthe area, out of the state. It is clear what happens when local control goes away, prices rise andbenefit only shareholders that most of the time do not live anywhere near that business that is beingtaken over. Thank you."

I am opposed to this sale and would like to see\nthis not go through. Private equity companies tend to sell off the assets of the companies and bankrupt them in orderto make back their money. Often times, rates go up and employees get laid off. The concerns of this company arestrictly profits to their shareholders, by law. I am disappointed to have to advocate for this, as it is well documentedthat this would be a poor choice.\nThank you,Marah Evans\nSent from my iPhone"

People on fixed incomes, like my widowed 86 year old mom, are barely holding ontotheir homes. Her power bill is already too expensive and she plans on calling MN power to figure outwhy.

It will be the goal of BlackRock to stripMinnesota Power of all profits while increasing our utility costs. BlackRock does not want to manageMinnesota Power it wants to suck every last drop of profits from Minnestoa Power at the expense ofMinnesota residents. Minnestoa needs to take a stand and protect our private infrastructure fromlarge corporations looking to take advantage of Minnesota."

With the recent extreme cuts to our federal funding budget, which are gutting our socialsafety nets that provide energy assistance to our poor and our elderly community, we cannot allow aprivate equity firm to erode our ability to power Minnesota.Please keep our Minnesota Power safe from corporate greed and do Not allow ALLETE/MinnesotaPower to sell out to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.Thank you\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

I\nguess I don't understand how a public utility would be sold to investment companies. I mean I'veseen all these horror stories about investment companies buying hospitals and houses. Either therent goes up or the hospitals can't offer services anymore and close. With investment companies it'sall about the bottom line and making money. Electricity is a service....a public service. We needelectricity. I know I pay my bill every month so I know Allete is bringing money in.

Learn why this is important\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nAs former long-time employees of Allete/Minnesota Power, and as retirees who receive both a  \npension and medical reimbursement from the company, we are writing to express our strong  \nopposition to the proposed sale of Allete to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a subsidiary of  \nBlackrock, and the Canada Pension Plan Fund (CPP).\nWe are also current shareholders of Allete. However, if this deal is approved, all shareholders—\nourselves included—will be forced to sell our shares. We will have no choice in the matter. That  \nalone is deeply concerning, as it strips away the voice and investment of long-time employees,  \nretirees, and individuals who believe in the company’s long-term mission and its value to Minnesota  \ncommunities.\nThis $6.2 billion sale is facing well-founded opposition from a diverse coalition of stakeholders,  \nincluding consumer advocates, the mining and wood products industries, and the Minnesota  \nDepartment of Commerce. The concerns are substantial and credible: increased rates for customers,  \nloss of local control, and a lack of transparency throughout the process.\nGIP and CPP argue that they are better positioned to fund Allete’s renewable energy transition and  \ninfrastructure needs. Yet testimony from financial and regulatory experts, including those  \nrepresenting the Minnesota Department of Commerce, disputes these claims. They cite a lack of  \nevidence that the acquisition would improve access to capital or benefit ratepayers in any meaningful  \nway. In fact, the proposed transaction appears to pose significant risk of large rate increases,  \nspeculative investment strategies, and an erosion of public oversight.Furthermore, we are disturbed by reports that GIP and CPP have avoided transparency during these  \nproceedings—refusing to answer questions fully, providing redacted responses, and limiting  \nmeaningful public engagement. This lack of openness is not compatible with the trust and  \naccountability required of a utility provider responsible for serving Minnesota homes and businesses.\nMinnesota Power is more than a utility—it’s part of the fabric of the state and the communities it  \nserves. It should not be turned over to private equity interests with global portfolios and short-term  \nprofit motives. We urge the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and all involved regulatory  \nbodies to reject this acquisition and preserve Allete’s accountability to the public.Sincerely,\nMichele DeSmet\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nPlease consider my urging to DENY the proposed acquisition. Blackrock is already\nembedded in the energy industry–especially by way of companies that have a history ofharming the water and environment. To approve the proposal would be to create a hugeconflict of interest. Blackrock’ is the single largest shareholder of Enbridge Energy. Enbridgeis one of Minnesota Power’s pipeline customers. CPP is a major investor in resourceextraction companies in Canada, including oil and gas drillers and Enbridge.\nThese conflicts of interest become super problematic when you look at the profit\nexpectations of private equity firms like Blackrock. This proposed acquisition is likely to raiserates for customers, because private equity investors demand higher profits than normalmarket investors. Over and over and over again in these kinds of acquisitions the cost of thedemanded profits gets passed on to the consumer. Private equity wants the most profit inthe relative short term, which is NOT good for the northland. Blackrock most likely will gofor high profit infrastructure investment rather than what is best for the people and theenvironment.\nI am worried about this for my kids. Not only will they face the higher rates, they will be left\nholding the bag environmentally. Low cost solar and wind resources likely will not align withthe profit motive of private equity that will always choose maximizing profits in the shortterm, before the ownership term is up.\nSpeaking of the ownership term, when private equity firms have raised the rates and\nsqueezed all the short-term profit they can at the expense of the people and the land, theywill sell the system off to the highest bidder, likely to other private equity, making itimpossible for public bidders to make a competitive bid. If you allow this sale, that is whatwill happen. GIP and CPP will take control of the ALLETE Board of Directors. This is a threatto local control, as they will seek influence of Minnesota Power’s business plans, budget,investments and corporate strategy.\nMy neighbors here in Duluth cannot afford to pay rising rates to fill the pockets of private\nequity billionaires. My children cannot afford the impact on the environment. GIP and CPPsay they share the goal of transitioning to clean energy, but they will not commit to thingslike retiring the Boswell coal plant on schedule. We know they will have a conflict of energyin the extraction of oil and gas and the pipeline industry. We don’t need a billionairemonopoly in our region controlling something so important as our power.\nFor the sake of Minnesota, for the sake of the people, for the sake of my children and your\nchildren, vote no. This sale is not in the best interest of the people.\nThank you,\nRachelle Wakefield\nDuluth Resident\nFrom: theresepelkey@everyactioncustom.com  on behalf of Therese Pelkey\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: Reject the ALLETE/MN Power acquisition by Canada PPI Board & GIP (BlackRock) / PUC Docket Number 24-198\nDate: Thursday, April 10, 2025 2:36:35 PM\n[You don't often get email from theresepelkey@everyactioncustom.com.

This public utility is a bedrock of ourregion's livability and economic vitality. Normally I would admit that the interests of the communityare not relevant in the consideration of a business-to-business transaction - stock holders being theappropriate stake holders - but for the sale of a public utility, this is not the case.\nThe history of BlackRock is such that the effects of a purchase of this essential public utility by them\nare as predictable as they are deleterious. While the stockholders in Minnesota Power will benefit,the community that the utility serves will suffer from increased prices and decreased investment. \nNorth Eastern Minnesota already faces a difficult enough economic environment without adding this\nadditional, and unnecessary burden.\nI strongly urge against permitting this sale to move forward.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Blackrock will bankrupt the utility,\nsqueeze all money out of it, and then sell it off in a terribly degraded state all while customers willface heavily damaged services and higher prices. All transparency will be lost, the utility will becomea slush fund, and property values will begin to decrease due to the issues with the grid. Small andmedium businesses will also suffer, while giant businesses will fire up diesel generators and furtherpollute our Minnesota air to keep the lights on.\nAgain, we must keep Minnesota Power as a publicly-owned utility.

Their business model revolves around short term profits at the expense of the communityand consumers of that utility. \nAllowing Minnesota Power to be sold to a private equity firm will result in higher rates to customers-\nwhich could lead to people losing their homes, grid resilience- which is more important than everwith climate change, and less focus on sustainability- which needs to be a major focus. \nUtilities need to serve the people of their communities, not be focused on profits at the expense of\ntheir customers.\nThank you.\nFrom: merz@everyactioncustom.com  on behalf of Elizabeth Merz\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: Reject the ALLETE/MN Power acquisition by Canada PPI Board & GIP (BlackRock) / PUC Docket Number 24-198\nDate: Wednesday, April 9, 2025 8:09:49 PM\n[You don't often get email from merz@everyactioncustom.com.

They are ONLY about making money from the money they already have,not serving the public.\nPrivate equity firms are the leading cause of ridiculously overpriced housing, as they have been able\nto pay above-market prices for single homes and apartment buildings, pricing out first-time homebuyers and low-income rental tenants. Then they resell the properties at hugely inflated prices toother private equity firms that have the same business model, endlessly hiking up inflation. Duluthhas already had a lot of negative impacts from this business model.\nPrivate equity firms have nearly destroyed health care in many states; Florida, is an example, where\nmany of the health care systems are now for-profit, owned by private equity firms. I have witnessedthe diminished quality and accessibility of those for-profit health care systems. Health care shouldbe a right of every citizen, not a cash cow to be milked until there's no CARE involved, and then thebarn is burned down.\nCurrently, we have excellent service and reasonable pricing for our electricity in the Duluth area.\nBecause of private equity firms' exclusively profit-motivated business model, they are a terriblechoice to be the owners of PUBLIC utilities. And BlackRock is one of the most infamously successfulat applying that business model to every business.\nPlease find a better solution than selling our public utility to a private equity firm that is not\nparticularly interested in the generation and provision of electricity, nor likely to retain all of the\ndedicated employees who risk their lives to rescue the public when we are left in the cold and\ndarkness.\nThank you for your thoughtful consideration of these important matters.\nSincerely,Sharon Becker\nDuluth, MN\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Private equity firms like BlackRock use their limitless wealth topurchase businesses, absorb all the assets of those businesses, reduce services to customers, thenshut them down or sell them to another private equity firm at an even higher price. These companiesare a major driver of inflation. This business model has been very detrimental, and sometimes fatal,to public services like health care systems, housing, and utilities, all over the country. Publicservices, such as the ones Minnesota Power provides, should not be put at risk so a very few peoplecan make more money than they will ever need, at the expense of residents.\nAdditionally, selling to BlackRock isn't going to create funding to move away from coal, as Allete\nseems to believe. BlackRock and other private equity firms are only in this for the money, and willsell off things piecemeal to make as much money as they can.

Private Equity has a track\nrecord of ripping the copper wire, figuratively, out from companies, saddling them with debt, andshutting them down, just to turn a profit. Minnesota as a state needs its power to be affordable andreliable, as the winters here are dangerous. This sale feels like it could leave many people withoutpower in the colder months, either through slashed staff, infrastructure, or just downright shuttingdown of services.\nThank you for taking the time to read this comment.Anthony C.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Private equityfirms are not accountable to the public. Their business model revolves around short-term profits,cost-cutting, and maximizing returns for investors, not long-term reliability, affordability, orcommunity well-being.\nAllowing Minnesota Power to be sold to private equity risks higher energy prices, reduced\ninvestment in grid resilience, and fewer commitments to sustainability. Residents of Minnesotadeserve a utility provider that prioritizes service reliability, clean energy innovation, and transparentpublic oversight-not one that treats electricity as just another asset in a financial portfolio.\nPower is not a luxury. It is an essential service, and it should remain under the guidance of those\nwho understand and respect their obligation to the people of Minnesota-not Wall Street.\nPlease do not approve or support this sale. Our communities deserve better."

Report all suspicious emails to Minnesota IT ServicesSecurity Operations Center.\n________________________________\nDear Minnesota Public Utilities Commission,\nI am writing to ask you to reject the sale of ALLETE/Minnesota Power to the Canada Pension Plan Investment\nBoard (CPP) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which is owned by BlackRock, the world’s biggest privateequity firm. This acquisition is not consistent with the public interest.\nThe interests of big private equity investors for outsized profits is inconsistent with the need to provide Minnesota\nPower customers and communities with the affordable, reliable, clean, and safe electricity we all need. This is a baddeal for Minnesota because it:\n- Risks saddling Minnesota ratepayers with higher electricity rates and less reliable and safe power service\n- Undermines the long-term stability and operational continuity of an electric utility that serves a critical public\nservice\n- Reduces public transparency and accountability by removing many requirements for disclosing information aboutthe company’s finances and business plans- Creates uncertainty in future employment for a large number of Minnesota Power’s employees- Puts Minnesota’s ability to meet its clean energy goals in the hands of far-off, wealthy investors who have myriadfossil fuel investments and have shown little commitment to cost-effective climate action\nIf this Commission is truly looking out for the best interests Minnesota Power customers, Minnesotans across the\nstate, and the public as a whole, it needs to reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by the CanadaPension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).\nSincerely,\nSharon Kutter\nGrey Eagle, MN 56336-4663\nslkutter@gmail.com"
