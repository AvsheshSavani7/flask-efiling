INTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota (“CUB ”) respectfully submits this initial brief (“CUB \nInitial Brief”) to provide recommendations to the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) and the Minnesota \nPublic Utilities Commission (the “Commission”) regarding the  July 19, 2024 petition (the “Petition”)  by \nALLETE, owner of Minnesota Power1 (“ALLETE ” or the “Company”) . ALLETE seeks approval of a \nproposed transaction through which the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( “CPP” or “CPP \nInvestments”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP” , collectively with CPP Investments, the \n“Partners” ) would acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of ALLETE, Inc . (the “Proposed Acquisition.”) \nCUB is a n independent, Minnesota -based nonprofit organization.  CUB’s role in this proceeding is to \nadvocate  for residential consumers’ interests by scrutinizing the Petition and assessing potential risks \nand benefits that arise from it.  \nThe Company claims the Proposed  Acquisition is “consistent with the public interest” -\nprimarily because it provides improved access to capital, which the Company will need to comply with Minnesota’s carbon reduction policies. The Company also suggests that it, and its customers, will \nbenefit from the Partners’ expertise in renewable energy projects. However, a number of \ninconsistencies on the record call into question the value of these purported benefits. For example, \nthough the Company claims in the Petit ion it will not be able to raise sufficient capital via public \nmarkets, its last two Annual Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission suggest the \nCompany is “well positioned to meet [its] financing needs due to adequate operating cash flows , \navailable additional working capital and access to capital markets.”\n2 Moreover, though the Company \nclaims it had its customers’ interests in mind when identifying the Partners as entities that share the \nCompany’s values, the Company rejected the Partners’ first two offers in order to negotiate a higher acquisition premium. Finally, though the Partners are experienced institutional investors, the Partners \nsend mixed signals about how they intend to utilize that expertise to influence the Company’s \ndecisions—on one hand, they suggest that Minnesota Power’s day -to-day operation s will continue to \nbe managed by existing Minnesota Power staff; on the other hand, the Partners have negotiated a \n \n11 Minnesota Power is an “operating division” of ALLETE, Inc., not a separate legal entity.  \n2 Ex. Sierra Club -1100 (Lane Direct) at 23 (eDocket No. 20252- 214960- 01), referencing  Attach. CL -7 (ALLETE, Inc. 2023 Form 10-\nK) at 58; Ex. MP -45 (ALLETE 2024 Form 10-K ) at 62 (eDocket No. 20253- 216998- 01). \n \nPUBLIC –HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATIO N REDACTED  \n \n2 \nCitizens Utility Board of Minnesota, Initial Brief  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 Governance Term Sheet hidden from public view that suggests they will have powerful governance \nand consent rights over the Company, including Minnesota Power’s operations . \nMeanwhile, several parties have identified potential risks likely to outweigh the potential \nbenefits. First, the Partners are paying a considerable, 19 to 20 percent acquisition premium to acquire \nALLETE, and they will have to recover at least that amount to earn a return on their investment. It seems likely that the Partners will push the Company to grow Minnesota Power’s rate base and/or increase rates more than may be necessary to generate that return. Further , though the  Company  \nclaims  in this docket th at it need s improved access capital to support “Minnesota Power’s continued \nadvancement toward complying with Minnesota’s 2040 Carbon Free Standard,”  the Company ’s \nrecently and separately filed integrated resource plan reveals plans to  “add approximately 1,000 \nmegawatts of natural gas capacity .”\n3 Finally, due to the Partners’ size and scope of investments, \napproval of the Proposed  Acquisition would introduce considerable conflicts of interest that amplify \nthe risk that the Partners will use their influence and control over ALLETE to benefit  affiliated interests \nor other companies held in its portfolio, potentially to the detriment of Minnesota Power customers.  \nOn balance, the risks of potential harm arising from the Proposed  Acquisition outweigh its \npotential benefits. Therefore, the Proposed  Acquisition is not consistent with the public interest, and \nthe Commission should deny its approval.  \n \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n \nA. The Petitioners have the burden of proof to s how the Proposed Acquisition  is \nconsistent with the p ublic interest. \n \nMinnesota Statute § 216B.50 prohibits  public utilities  from selling “ an operating unit or system \nin this state for a total consideration in excess of $1,000,000 [. . .] without first being authorized so to \ndo by the commission. ”  The law directs the Commission to approve the  sale only if  it finds it is \n“consistent with the public interest [.]” As the entities seeking the Commission’s approval of the \nProposed Acquisition, the Petitioners have the burden of proof to demonstrate the Proposed Acquisition is consistent with the Public Interest.   \n \n3 See Ex. Sierra Club -1102 (Corrected Lane Surrebuttal) at  Attachment CLS -1 (eDocket No. 20254- 217233- 02). \nPUBLIC –HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATIO N REDACTED  \n \n3 \nCitizens Utility Board of Minnesota, Initial Brief  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 The Petitioners suggest that Minn. Stat. § 216 B.50 “does not require an affirmative finding of \npublic benefit but requires only a finding that the transaction is compatible with the public interest.”4 \nIn support of this assertion, they cite a Commission order issued in November 1990.5 The Commission \nhas also historically “used a balancing test to determine if an acquisition is ‘consistent with the public \ninterest,’ weighing perceived detriments against benefits.”6 Notwithstanding the foregoing , there is no \nrequirement for the current Commission to conform its review of the Proposed Acquisition to that of \nits predecessors—particularly  considering that Minnesota law and policy  surrounding electric services  \nhas changed considerably since 1990. For example, in 2007 the Minnesota Legislature passed the Next Generation Energy Act after finding “that continued growth in demand for energy will cause severe social and economic dislocations” and that “the protection of life, safety, and financial sec urity for \ncitizens during an energy crisis is of paramount importance.”\n7 2017  legislation created an energy \npolicy goal of holding retail electricity rates for each customer class to be at least five present below \nthe national average.8 In 2010, the Legislature acted again to reframe utilities’ annual spending goals \nas savings goals. And, finally, in 2023 the Legislature adopted the Carbon Free Standard that pushes \nMinnesota utilities to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040.9 Acknowledgment  of these \nlegislative developments—as well as the myriad other developments that have evolved in Commission \nproceedings over the past 35 years—inform and add to what it means to be “consistent with the public \ninterest” today.  \n \nB. If the Petitioners seek a pproval of the Proposed Acquisition to m eet Minnesota’s \nCarbon Free Standard, then the Commission must implement that Standard in \na way that m aximizes public benefits. \n \nThroughout their filings in this docket, the Petitioners suggest that approving the Proposed \nAcquisition is consistent with the public interest because the Company requires improved access to capital  to comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard ( Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691  Subd. 2g).\n10  This \n \n4 Ex. MP -1 (Petition) at 12 (eDocket No. 20247- 208768- 01); See also, Ex.

MP -31 (Alley Rebuttal) at \nPUBLIC –HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATIO N REDACTED  \n \n4 \nCitizens Utility Board of Minnesota, Initial Brief  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 Standard requires Minnesota electric utilities to “generate or procure sufficient electricity generated \nfrom a carbon -free energy technology to provide the electric utility's retail customers in Minnesota, \nor the retail customers of a distribution utility to which the electric utility provide s wholesale electric \nservice, so that the electric utility generates or procures an amount of electricity from carbon- free \nenergy technologies that is equivalent to at least the following standard percentages of the electric \nutility's total retail electric  sales to retail customers in Minnesota by the end of the year indicated:  \n(1) 2030  80 percent for public utilities; 60 percent for  \nother electric utilities  \n(2) 2035  90 percent for all electric utilities  \n(3) 2040  100 percent for all electric utilities.” \nMinn. Stat. § 216B.1691 Subd. 2b also directs the Comm ission to “modify or delay the \nimplementation [of the above standard] in whole or in part, if the commission determines that \nmodifying or delaying the standard obligation is in the public interest.” When evaluating a request to \nmodify or delay implementation of a standard, the Commission must consider (among other factors) \n“the impact of implementing the standard on its customers’ utility costs, including the economic and \ncompetitive  pressure on the utility’s customers.”   \nAlso importantly, the 2023 legislation establishing the Carbon Free Standard affirmatively \nrequires  the Commission to “maximize net benefits” to Minnesotans when implementing it:  \n \nThe commission shall take all reasonable actions within the commission's statutory authority \nto ensure this section [§ 216B.1691] is implemented in a manner that maximizes net benefits \nto all Minnesota citizens.11 \n \nIt is inconsistent for the Petitioner’s, on one hand, to suggest Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 “does not \nrequire an affirmative finding of public benefit” and, on the other hand, justify the Proposed \nAcquisition as necessary to comply with legislation that require s the Commissio n, when implementing \n \n28 (eDocket No. 20253- 216055- 09) (“Growth in ALLETE’s market value rests heavily on Minnesota Power’s ability to continue \nproviding reliable service to customers at affordable rates while successfully implementing its plan to comply with \nMinnesota’s Carbon Free Standard”); Ex. MP -33 (Bram Rebuttal) at  3 (eDocket No. 20253- 216055- 08) (“GIP recognized \nALLETE’s history of successful management and operations as well as its commitment to Minnesota’s decarbonization policy, and ALLETE’s objective to establish itself as the “utility of the future” – a utility running on carbon -free energy  that is still safe, \nreliable, and affordable. Achieving these goals is not merely an operational and management target, but also a requirement \nunder the Carbon Free Standard in Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 2g”).  \n11 Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691 Subd. 9(a).  \nPUBLIC –HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATIO N REDACTED  \n \n5 \nCitizens Utility Board of Minnesota, Initial Brief  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 that legislation , to maximize public benefits. Because compliance with the Carbon Free Standard is \nfoundational to the Petitioners’ request for approval, the requirements of Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691 \nSubd. 9(a) provide a good starting point for the Commission to sharpen what it means to be \n“consistent with the public interest” in this context. Of particular importance to CUB , the Commission \nshould consider whether the Proposed Acquisition, if approved, would maximize:  “the provision of \naffordable electric service to Minnesotans, particularly to low -income consumers. ”12 At minimum, the \nCommission should consider whether potential harms to the public —including rate increases arising \nfrom or amplified by the Proposed Acquisition— outweigh its potential benefits. To balance potential \nbenefits against potential risks, the Commission should consider whether the ”commitments” the \nCompany and Partners offer to address Parties‘ concerns represent new , proactive actions that \ncounter new  risks and potential harms arising from the transaction, or whether they merely articulate \nstatus quo actions the Commission would expect to continue whether or not the Proposed Acquisition \nis approve d. \n \nIII. ARGUMENT  \n \nIf the Proposed Acquisition is approved, ALLETE will transition from a publicly traded company \nwith its ownership shared by hundreds or thousands of unrelated shareholders to a private company owned by two entities, GIP and CPP Investments, who act in part nership. At a high level, the primary \npurported benefit of this transition would be to allow ALLLETE improved access to capital from the \nPartners —specifically to fund the Company’s five -year capital plan. The Petition also cite s the Partners’ \nexperience wi th infrastructure investments as a potential benefit. For the reasons discussed below, \nthe value of both benefits is unclear and/or overstated.  \nMeanwhile, we are concerned that the Partners’ efforts to recoup their investment will cause \nor exasperate rate increases;  allow the Partners  excessive influence and control over  the governance \nof ALLETE and Minnesota Power; introduce complex affiliated interest concerns; reduce transparency; \nand generally put undue pressure on the Commission, government agencies, and intervenors to \nmitigate new risk of consumer harm in the future . The Company’s and Partners’ offered commitments \nand affirmations do little t o assuage these concerns.  \n \n12 Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691 Subd. 9(a)(6).  See also  § 216B.1691 Subd. 9(b) (“The Commission must also implement this section in \na manner that balances factors such as . . . the costs of energy generation to satisfy the renewable and carbon -free \nstandards[.]”)  \nPUBLIC –HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATIO N REDACTED  \n \n6 \nCitizens Utility Board of Minnesota, Initial Brief  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198  \nA. Potential benefits to ratepayers, Minnesota, or the public interest from the \nProposed Acquisition  are either unclear or overstated.  \n \nThe Company asserts two potential benefits that arise from the Proposed Acquisition : \nimproved access to capital and access to the Partners’ experience in renewable infrastructure \ninvestments. Evidence introduced by intervenors’ witnesses raises considerable doubt about the weight of both purported benefits.  \n \ni. Witness Taran’s testimony is inconsistent with Annual Reports filed with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  \n \nCompany witness, Joshua D. Taran, testifies that ALLETE needs to raise approximately $1 \nbillion of external equity over the next five years alone to fund the over $4 billion in planned capital \nexpenditures, in addition to significant new debt issuances and refinancing.13  Witness Taran further \ntestifies that “[b]ecause ALLETE’s operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to fund its capital needs, the Company would not be able to make the necessary investments to meet the State’s Carbon \nFree Standard without external c apital” and that “it is highly likely that ALLETE would have difficulty \nraising” that external capital if ALLETE remains publicly traded.\n14  After Intervenors filed direct \ntestimony expressing concerns about the Proposed Acquisition, the Partner’s indicated a \n“commitment”  to fund the Company’s 5 -year investment plan found in the Company’s 2024 Annual \nReport ( Form 10 -K) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).15  \nIn exchange for being able to raise capital via public markets, ALLETE (as a public company) is \nsubject to stringent reporting and disclosure requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, public companies must file periodic, quarterly, and annual reports with the SEC  \nproviding detailed information about the company’s financial health and the company’s exposure to \npotential risks that could affect the value of an investment in that company . Failure to transparently \ndisclose such r isks exposes a company and its officers and directors to serious potential liability , as \ndoes otherwise making materially false or misleading statements.\n16 Because ALLETE is currently a \npublic company, it regularly files reports with the SEC. Those Reports are reviewed, approved and \n \n13 Ex. MP -11 (Taran Direct) at 3, 6 (eDocket No. 202412- 212968- 05). \n14 Id. at 7. \n15 Ex.

We will finance capital \nexpenditures from a combination of internally generated funds, debt and equity issuance \nproceeds. We intend to maintain a capital structure with capital ratios near current levels .20 \n \nThis language repeats, verbatim, what the Company had previously disclosed in its 2023 Form 10 -K \nreferring to $4.2 billion (including South Shore) in capital requirements  then projected  for the years \n2024 -2028.21  \n \n17 See e.g., Ex.

Alternatively, if this statement is true, then Witness Taran overstates the \nCompany’s need for the Proposed Acquisition when he testifies that “ALLETE’s operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to fund its capital needs” and that “it is highly likely that ALLETE would have difficulty raising” needed capital via public markets.  \nWitness Taran was asked about the above language during the evidentiary hearing.\n22 On \nredirect, he suggested that, rather than view the above -quoted sentence in isolation, “investors and \nothers should take into account the whole body of the 10 -K.”23 He then pointed to other areas of the \nForm 10 -K that he suggests are particularly relevant  to this proceeding .24 Namely, Page 32 of the 2024 \n10-K discloses the following  risk factor : \n We rely on access to financing sources and capital markets. If we do not have access to capital \non acceptable terms or are unable to obtain capital when needed, our ability to execute our \nbusiness plans, make capital expenditures or pursue other strategic actions that we may \notherwise rely on for future growth would be adversely affected.\n25 \n \nHe also pointed to Page 59 of  the Form 2024  10-K, which  states  “ALLETE is well -positioned to meet its \nliquidity needs ” due in part to “the option (per the Merger Agreement) to request that Alloy Parent \npurchase up to a total of $300 million of preferred stock of ALLETE in the second half of 2025[ .]”26 \nIf reading the full 2024 Form 10-K has value, so does reading the  Company’s  full 2023 Form \n10-K. T he Company filed its 2023 Form 10 -K on February 20, 2024 —a few days  after rejecting the \nPartners’ second offer  to acquire ALLETE for $6 4 per share  and over one month  before  accepting the \nPartners’  third offer  of $67 per share .27 The 2023 10 -K discloses the risk of ALLETE relying on access \nto financing sources and capital markets  using language identical to that Witness Taran references in \n \n22 Hearing Transcript Vol. 1 at  281.  \n23 Id. at 320.  \n24 Id. at 319-3 30. \n25 Ex.

The Partners’ “commitment” to support the Company’s capital needs is \nunenforceable.  \n \nIn discovery, CUB posed the following question to the Petitioners: “ For all benefits that you \nassert will come from this transaction, explain why those benefits would not be available without the \ntransaction. ” In response, the Company said, in part:  \n \nThe primary benefit of the transaction, as stated in the July 19, 2024 Petition, is that the \nCompany will be able to access capital from highly experienced partners . . . .

Witness Addonizio says \nof the Partner’s commitment to provide equity financing required to fund the Company’s five -year \ncapital plan: “It is unclear how the Commission could enforce this commitment if the Partners do not \nfulfill it.”44 Witness Vavro says of the Partners’ commitments to provide access to books and records \nof entities up to and including Alloy Parent as “’affirmations’ rather than formal commitments [that] may not be enforceable unless contained in a Commission order and the Partners agree to submit to \nthe Commission’s jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing such an order.”\n45  \n \niv. The lack of enforceability puts more pressure on the Commission.  \n \nFinally, t hroughout this proceeding, the  Company and Partners attempt to dismiss concerns \nabout enforceability by noting that Minnesota Power will continue to be regulated by the Commission, and, therefore, the Commission will continue to have authority to set the Company’s rates and take \nother actions to protect the interests of Minnesota Power’s customers.\n46 We, of course, agree the \nCommission will continue to have this authority over Minnesota Power.

It is CUB’s understanding that none of these entities were made aware of the Company’s evaluation of potential buyers until the Company \nissued a press release May 6,  2024 announcing that they had already entered into the Merger \nAgreement.

The Proxy Statement tells a somewhat different story.  \nAs described in the Proxy Statement, J.P.

During these meetings, representatives of J.P.

In response, the \nCompany  confirmed the ALLETE Board of Directors “authorizes management to conduct the business \nof Minnesota Power” and  that such Board authorizations “may include approval for specific regulatory \nfilings, utility projects, or resource additions or general authorizations to management.”\n114 In other \nwords, the ALLETE Board could choose to preserve its authority to review and approve material Commission filings on a case -by-case basis, or the Board could vote to generally authorize Minnesota \nPower management to submit regulatory filings without  case -by-case Board review and approval. ( Of \ncourse, if the Board votes to m ake the latter authorization, it could also vote to remove that \nauthorization. ) In any case, the ALLETE Board of Directors clearly plays an important role in  providing \ngovernance and oversight over  Minnesota Power’s  current  operations.  \nCurrently, ALLETE’s shares are widely distributed amongst hundreds or thousands of \nshareholders.

The Proposed Acquisition introduces uncertainties as to how Minnesota Power \nwill cost -effectively comply with Minnesota’s carbon- free standard.  \n  \nThe Company claims it needs improved access capital to support “ALLETE’s investment in the \nclean energy transition”\n127 and that “Minnesota Power’s continued advancement toward complying \nwith Minnesota’s 2040 Carbon Free Standard is supported by the Acquisition, including the extensive \ncapital needs that Minnesota Power will require to meet the mandate.”128  The Company also states \n“[a]ll resource planning for the Company’s proposed path to compliance with Minnesota’s 2040 \nCarbon Free Standard will be addressed through the [IRP] process, with the Company’s next IRP to be filed March 3, 2025.”\n129 However , the  Company’s messaging in this docket is inconsistent with the \nplans outlined in its 2025 IRP . As Sierra Club Witness Lane observes:  \n Minnesota Power’s 2025 -2039 IRP proposes a resource mix that includes far more new natural \ngas than new renewable energy resources. Specifically, the Company’s 2025 -2039 IRP \nproposes to add over 1,000 MW of new natural gas capacity, while proposing 400 MW of new \nwind, 100 MW of new battery storage, and no new utility -scale solar beyond the resources in \nits 2021 IRP.\n130 \n \n \nIt is ultimately the Commission that will decide the best path to comply with the C arbon -Free \nstandard.131 As noted above, Minn.

Approval of the Acquisition will introduce significant new concerns regarding \naffiliated interests  \n \nThroughout this proceeding, numerous parties and public commenters have raised concerns \nabout actual and perceived conflicts of interest that the Proposed Acquisition will introduce, given the \nPartners’ expansive financial interests in companies that curre ntly do business with ALLETE and/or \nwork in energy/utility adjacent industries. Numerous public comment ors specifically express concern \nabout BlackRock’s indirect ownership of ALLETE. There is good reason for concern. BlackRock , Inc., \nwhich wholly -owns GIP , “has 15,000 employees in 38 countries and manages over $10 trillion in \nassets.”134 This makes it one of the most, if not the most, financially powerful private companies on \nthe planet. Because both Partners’  financial interests expand to so many companies, there is real (or \nat least reasonably perceived) risk that  the Partners —and particularly  GIP—could use its influence \nover ALLETE and Minnesota Power to benefit other affiliated interests.  \nSeveral witnesses articulate  this concern  and/or introduce evidence emphasizing  it. \nDepartment Witness Addonizio testifies “ the Acquisition raises significant risks of financial harm to \nMinnesota Power’s ratepayers that may potentially result from self -dealing between the Company \nand the other investment holdings and affiliates of GIP (which is now a part of BlackRock, Inc., th e \nworld’s largest asset manager) and CPP Investments.”135 Department Witness Vavro testifies, “ [g]iven \nthe size and scale of the Partners and BlackRock, and their involvement in an extremely wide range of industries and companies, there is clearly a high potential for conflicts of interest —this is hardly \ndebatable. ”\n136 Witness Lebens references BlackRock’s press release on its acquisition of GIP, which \nnotes:  \n \n133 In the Matter of Minnesota Power’s 2021 -2035 Integrated Resource Plan , Order Approving Plan and Setting Additional \nRequirements, MPUC Docket No. E -015/RP- 21-33 (Jan. 9, 2023), p. 10.  \n134 Ex.

The over $150 billion combined business will seek to deliver \nclients market -leading, holistic infrastructure expertise across equity, debt and solutions at \nsubstantial scale. Marrying the proprietary origination and business improvement capabilities of GIP and BlackRock’s global corporate and sovereign  relationships provides a platform for \ndiversi fied, large -scale sourcing to support deal fl ow and co- investment opportunities for \nclients. We believe bringing GIP and BlackRock together will deliver to clients the benefi ts of \nbroader origination and business improvement capabilities.\n137 \n \nFinally, Witness Baker notes that GIP’s CEO, Adebayo Ogunlesi is now also a BlackRock Senior \nManaging Director and board member.138 Speaking at a recent infrastructure industry conference, \nMr. Ogunlesi said “For those of you who are competitors, I feel sorry as all the deals are going to come \nto us, given BlackRock is either a shareholder or bondholder in all companies. But we’ll try and leave some crumbs for the rest of you.”\n139  \nCompany Witness Anderson asserts that BlackRock’s relationship to ALLETE will continue to \nbe at “arm’s length ,”140 noting : \n The affiliated interest statute will remain an effective tool to protect the public from harm that \nmay result from self -dealing among related companies. But it does not follow that affiliated \ninterest scrutiny needs to apply where there is a lack of direct  control over the contracting \ncompany or  companies, whether it be the utility or its counterparties. Put another way, if there \nis not an ability on the part of an investor to directly control or influence the contracting  decisions of an entity, that entity’s contracts will be entered into at arms- length relative to \nother interests of the investor, and the concerns of self -dealing are not present.  \n \nWitness Anderson further proposes : “the Company annually require all vendors to identify whether \nthey are more than five percent owned by GIP, CPP Investments or BlackRock. In addition, Minnesota \nPower will identify any contracts over $1 million executed with an identified supplier or contract industrial customer and will disclose those contracts to the Commission within 30 days of execution. ”\n141  \nThere are two problems with this proposal. First, whether one company has a “lack of direct \ncontrol” —or the extent of one company’s control  over another —is not always clear.  The Partners \n \n137 Ex.

Second, while the affiliated interest statute may  “remain an effective \ntool” to the extent it compels disclosure of affiliated interest , it also adds to the burdens imposed on \nthe Commission, Department, OAG, and other advocates  to monitor and investigate such disclosures \nto identify potentially harmful  self-dealing relationships and distinguish them from more mundane \naffiliations. \nvii. Approval of the Proposed Acquisition may have other unintended, avoidable \nconsequences.  \n \nThe Company’s and Partners’ Joint Witness, John Quackenbush, cites the acquisition of the \nUpper Peninsula Power Company (“UPPCO”) in Michigan as a positive example of  a private \ninfrastructure investors’ acquisition of a regulated utility .142 Specifically, Witness Quackenbush \nsuggests the UPPCO acquisition helps exemplify why “private infrastructure investment is a good fit \nfor ALLETE considering its unique circumstances.”143 In reality, the UPPCO acquisition exemplifies the \ntype of unforeseen  consequences—and ratepayer harm —that can arise if a private equity acquisition \nof a regulated utility company is  approved without careful consideration of potential consequences .  \nCUB Witness Jester, a Michigan -based consultant, has monitored or participated in many \nMichigan Public Service Commission proceedings involving UPPCO, including the first rate case UPPCO filed after it was acquired by private infrastructure investors. Witness Jester describes some of the \nconsequences that arose for UPPCO and its customers after it was acquired by a private infrastructure investor:  \n \n• UPPCO requested a large increase in its return on common equity;  \n• UPPCO requested substantial increases in expenses to recover increases in pension costs not adequately disclosed or discussed in the acquisition docket;  \n• UPPCO proposed a large increase to distribution system maintenance expenses after reducing maintenance investments while approval of the acquisition was pending;  \n• UPPCO was slow to terminate an above -market power purchase agreement (“PPA”) with an \naffiliated entity;  \n \n142 Ex. MP -12  (Quackenbush Direct) at 20- 21 (eDocket No. 202412- 212972- 01). \n143 Id. \nPUBLIC –HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATIO N REDACTED  \n \n30 \nCitizens Utility Board of Minnesota, Initial Brief  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 • UPPCO incurred debt, the cost of which was “persistently high compared to the costs of debt \ndirectly to various other Michigan utilities” —perhaps because the debt was incurred through \nan affiliate transaction.144  \n Also , just seven years after the Michigan Commission approved the initial acquisition of \nUPPCO, the acquirers decided to sell it  to a different private infrastructure investo r, prompting  the \nMichigan Commission and stakeholders to repeat the process of reviewing a second transaction for \napproval.\n145 Witness Baker testified that these second acquirers “promised not to raise rates until \n2023” but then sought and received a 10.1% rate increase in July 2023 .146 The new owners then filed \na second, 16% rate increase request a year after that.147 Meanwhile, the UPPCO “dilemma” prompted \na different consultant to publish a 71 -page white paper examining why UPPCO investors, customers \nand regulators were “locked in a zero sum game.”148   \nGenerally speaking, Witness Jester has found that the initial acquisition of UPPCO \n“exacerbate[ed] an  affordability problem,” which Michigan advocates and the Michigan Commission \nhave subsequently  had to reckon  with .149 While the specific  challenges affecting UPPCO  may not also \nmaterialize for ALLETE/Minnesota Power, they exemplify the type of problems the Commission may \nface if the  Proposed Acquisition is approved .  \n \nviii. The Partners’ lack of Transparency is likely  to get worse, not better, if the \nAcquisition is approved.  \n \nThe Petition asserts: “While the Acquisition will change the ownership of ALLETE, many things \nwill not change, including . . . the transparency to which the Commission is accustomed in its regulation of Minnesota Power.”\n150 Our experience  (along with several other Parties’ experience) with \nthe Partners so far has proved otherwise.  Witness Walters articulates this well in his Direct Testimony:  \n \nApplicants claim that their commitments and proposed safeguards will protect Minnesota \nPower’s customers.  But their case is undermined by a consistent lack of transparency.  \n \n144 Ex. CUB -505 ( Jester Direct ) at 8 (eDocket No. 20252- 214944- 03). \n145 Ex.

The Applicant’s pattern of \nwithholding critical information raises serious concerns about the veracity of their claims \npromising transparency in future operations, assuming Acquisition approval.\n151   \n  \nThe ALJ’s Order on Motion to Compel dated March 18, 2025 outlines an illustrative example of \nthe Partners’ lack of transparency. In discovery, the Department requested “copies of any analysis GIP \nhad conducted to value ALLETE or Minnesota Power, including copies of investor presentations .”152 In \nresponse, GIP produced a “May 2024 presentation prepared for its investment committee as part of \nits final decision to make an investment in ALLETE.”153 The presentation , already marked HCTS,  \ncontained numerous redactions, “purportedly on the grounds of relevance, proportionality, or \nprejudice.”154 Some of those redactions were based on Canadian data- privacy law ; others were based \non the claim that investment committee memos were protected under the attorney work product doctrine . Ultimately, the ALJ found several such redactions were improper  and ordered they be \nremoved.\n155 In so doing, she found “all redactions based on Canadian law are improper;”  and the \nPartners did not show the  investor committee memos were “prepared in anticipation of litigation” \nand, therefore, “are not attorney work product.”156  \nTransitioning from a public company to a privately -held  company will also have more general \nconsequences for the transparency of the Company’s business operations and financial health. As noted earlier, public companies are required to file detailed reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a regular basis.\n157 Public companies’ quarterly earnings calls and investor \npresentations are also made public. This information allows analysts, advocates, and regulators robust access to important information that helps assess what is going well or not so well for a utilit y \nand its parent company . Though the Company commits to “file the audited ALLETE Consolidated \n \n151 Ex.

As Witness Lane observes:   \n regulators and stakeholders would need parent -level financial information to vet how long the \nPartners may be intending to hold ALLETE or certain ALLETE assets before a sale. SEC reporting \ncould shed light on the parents’ financial situation, enabling  out side observers to judge when \na sale may be forthcoming. Such reporting would not be available after the Acquisition is approved.\n159 \n If the Commission approves the Proposed Acquisition, it should expect to have less insight into the \nfinancial health of the Company  and the entities above it on the proposed post -Acquisition \norganizational chart.  \n \nC. The “commitments” and “affirmations” made by the Partners are insufficient to \novercome concerns about potential harms arising from the Proposed Acquisition.  \n \nIn her Rebuttal Testimony, Witness Cady summarizes 35 “commitments Minnesota Power, \nGIP, and CPP Investments” are purportedly making “to address the comments of Intervenors, as well as those commitments previously stated in the Merger Agreement, Petition, and Direct Testimony.”\n160 \nThough some  of these commitment describe new actions to be taken by the Company or Partners if \nthe Proposed Acquisition is approved, most appear  “intended to communicate what will not \nchange .”161 In this regard, most of the 35 commitments are not benefits that would arise because of \nthe Acquisition but rather existing practices  that would continue despite it. As such, they collectively \ncarry little weight in counterbalancing the  new  risks of harm described above.   \n \ni. Several commitments and affirmations simply recite legal requirements \nalready applicable to Minnesota Power.  \n \nAt the Evidentiary Hearing, counsel for the OAG asked Witness Cady about each of the 35  \ncommitments. Through that questioning, Ms. Cady acknowledged that many of the commitments  and \naffirmations describe legal requirements that are currently, and will remain, applicable to Minnesota \nPower regardless of whether the Acquisition is approved . For example : \n \n158 Ex. MP -27 (Cady Rebuttal) at Schedule 1, p. 6 (eDocket No. 20253- 216055- 03). \n159 See Ex.

Stat. 216B.48 , whether or not the Company “commits” to it .164 (Though, if \nanything, this commitment does not go far enough to address the unique concerns about \naffiliated interests raised in  this context, as described above .165) \n \n• The Company’s and Partners’ affirmation of their understanding that the “budget billing provisions in Minn. Stat. § 216B.098, subdivisions 2 and 3 refer to all residential customers” \nmerely reflects the plain language of that statute .\n166  \n \nSimilarly, the 13 “additional affirmations of the regulatory compact” are simply recitations of legal requirements applicable to Minnesota Power  and other utilities subject to the Commission’s \njurisdiction.\n167 In that regard, the affirmations have value only as a reference point, not as an additive \n \n162 Ex.

Some commitments are superfluous when considered in their broader context. \n \nSome of the  “new”  commitments are not particularly meaningful when considered in their full \ncontext . For example, the commitment to not count the ALLETE CEO’s board seat as one of the two \nindependent directors from Minnesota or Wisconsin means little considering the Partners ’ consent \nrights and authority to collectively appoint 10 of 13 directors to the  ALLETE  Board (as discussed above). \nLikewise, the Company’s commitment to “not attempt to recover Acquisition costs from utility customers” rings hollow in light of the Partners’ HCTS discussions  on how they expect to earn a return . \nAs stated previously , while we do not expect the Company to file a rate case that  lists “acquisition \npremium” as a line item in its revenue requirement, several witnesses have provided substantial evidence showing the Partners will need to grow rate base and/or increase rates to earn a return on \ntheir investment.  \n \niii. Those few commitments that provide new consumer benefits do not outweigh \nnew risks of harm . \n \nFinally, while we acknowledge some of the commitments provide consumer benefits, those \nbenefits are insufficient to overcome the significant new risks of consumer harm discussed above.  \n \na. The CARE Program  and commitment of shareholder funds to pay \ndown arrears  \n \nFor example,  the Company and Partners commit that “there will be no reduction in Minnesota \nPower’s currently designed affordability program budget (formally referred to as the Customer Affordability of Residential Electricity program or “CARE”).”\n168 In light of this commitment, low -income \nconsumer advocate, the Energy CENTS Coalition  (“ECC”) , supports approval of the Proposed \nAcquisition.169 To be clear, CUB strongly supports the CARE program —and the Company’s and ECC’s  \nwork to improve and expand it over the past decade. R egardless of whether the Proposed Acquisition \n \n168 Ex. MP -27 (Cady Rebuttal) at Sec. IX (eDocket No. 20253- 216055- 03).; Ex. MP -31 (Alley Rebuttal ) at Sec.

However , several issues with this \ncommitment reveal it s benefits are limited. \nFirst, the CARE program is funded by ratepayers, not shareholders.170 It was created  in 2011 \nafter the Commission ordered Minnesota Power to develop a low- income affordability program , and \nthe Commission has  continuously approved funding for the program in every year since then through \nits review of annual reports .171 Because it is a ratepayer -funded program that  is subject to the \nCommission’s ongoing review, the commitment to not reduce the CARE budget is simply a commitment to not request the Commission’s approval to lower the budge t—a request unlikely to be \napproved given the popularity of and need for the program . Further, because other ratepayers fund \nthe program through a surcharge added to their bills , the commitment to not reduce the CARE budget \nis not a new benefit the Company or Partners offer in support of the Proposed Acquisition —it is a \ncommitment to continue charging the majority  of ratepayers to  fund a program utilized by some \nratepayers .  \nSecond, If customer rates go up after the Proposed Acquisition is approved, more customers \nare likely to spend more than 3% of their annual income on their electric bills —creating more demand \nfor an affordability discount program .\n172 A commitment to maintain the CARE program’s existing \nbudget and eligibility requirements, while good for current CARE participants, does not  help \ncustomers struggling to pay their bills  but that are ineligible for the CARE flat discount  or eligible but  \ncurrently  unable to participate in the full -subscribed  affordability discount .173 \nFinally, the Partners’ commitment to provide funding to pay down arrears, while helpful to \nsome customers in the near -term, will not provide widespread, lasting protections. Witness Cady \nestimates the dollar value of this commitment to be approximately $3. 5 million— though she \nacknowledges that, technically, the dollar amount required to meet that commitment could be less.174 \nEven if the Partners were to pay off the full amount of Minnesota Powers’ arrears (totaling around \n$4.3 million as of February 2025),175 that financial commitment would represent less than 0.1 percent \nof the value the Partners have committed to acquire ALLETE.

Union workforce  \n \nCUB supports ALLETE’s ongoing employment of local workers and engagement with \nMinnesota’s labor unions. In that regard, we are pleased to see that IBEW Local 31 has successfully extended it s collective bargaining agreement with Minnesota Power through April 30, 2028.\n176 \nHowever, this benefit is not one that newly arises because of the Proposed Acquisition; it is a benefit \nthat continues despite it. “The Company routinely contractually requires contractors and \nsubcontractors to pay their workers prevailing wage as evidenced by local collective bargaining agreements and to ascertain local conditions, work rules, and union jurisdiction. The Company also  \nseeks to deploy union labor wherever reasonably possible.”\n177 The Commission , too, has recently \nincluded requirements supporting  use of  local labor in its orders. For example, when approving \nMinnesota Power’s last integrated resource plan, the Commission ordered Minnesota Power to “work[ ] with organized labor and other interested stakeholders to maximize . . . use of local labor for construction and permanent staffing[.]”\n178 We expect Minnesota Power’s and the Commission’s \nsupport of local labor to continue regardless of whether the Proposed Acquisition is approved.  \n \nD. Although FERC and the Wisconsin Public Service Commission have already approved \nthe Proposed Acquisition, the Commission should heed warnings offered by the \nFERC Chairman  in concurring opinions . \n For the Proposed Acquisition to successfully close, Minnesota Power must obtain certain  \nshareholder and regulatory approvals. The Company has already obtained necessary approvals from ALLETE’s shareholders, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), and the Wisconsin Public \nService Commission.\n179 According to the Company, the  “only remaining state or federal regulatory \napproval required to close this transaction is that of the Commission in this docket.”180 \n \n176 Ex.

Further , \nFERC clarified in its Order that “whether the Proposed Acquisition fulfills the respective state \nrequirements for Minnesota Commission and Wisconsin Commission approval is a separate question \nfrom whether the Proposed Acquisition is consistent with the public interest under [the Federal Power \nAct (FPA)] section 203, and our findings under FPA section 203 do not affect those agencies’ evaluation \nof the Proposed Acquisition pursuant to their respective statutory authorities.”184  \nIn related FERC proceedings,  FERC Chairman Marc C. Christie issued warnings that should \ninform the Commission’s review of the Proposed Acquisition. Prior to approving the Proposed \nAcquisition in the order cited above , FERC approved BlackRock’s $12.5 billion acquisition of GIP.185 In \na concurring opinion accompanying that approval, Chairman Christie  expressed concerns about the \npower “huge asset managers, like BlackRock” will wield when seeking to acquire interests in public utilities.\n186 He then  specifically called on “all utility regulators” to heed their responsibility “to make \nsure that such money is not being needlessly extracted from [energy] consumers’ pockets through \nexercises of market power or other forms of rent -seeking.”187 Chairman Christie issued a similar \nwarning in a concurring opinion accompan ying another recent  FERC order approving  the extension of \nBlackRock’s “blanket authorization ” to acquire voting securities of any public utilit y: \n \n \n181 Order Authorizing Disposition of Jurisdictional Facilities and Acquisition of Securities, Docket No. EC24 -105-000 (Dec. 19, 2024),  p. \n13, available at https://www.ferc.gov/media/e -14-ec24- 105- 000.  \n182 Id. at 22.  \n183 Id. at 13.  \n184 Id. at 21 -22. \n185 Order Authorizing Disposition of Jurisdictional Facilities and Acquisition of Securities re Global Infrastructure Management,  LLC et \nal.

Owning 20%, or even less than that, of a utility’s stock could well result in the \nexercise of substantial influence over a util ity. . . As I also have said before, a public utility has \npublic service obligations; it is not just another company seeking to maximize returns to its shareholders.  Many have been granted monopoly franchises by state governments in return \nfor serving the public within their territories.  One threat is that asset managers, like BlackRock, \nwill use their ownership of competing assets to exert market power in wholesale energy, \ncapacity, and ancillary services markets.\n188 \n Chairman Christie issues this warning about large asset managers “owning 20%, or even less” of a \nutility’s stock. If the Proposed Acquisition is approved, GIP (now wholly owned by BlackRock) will own 60 percent of ALLETE, and CPP will own the other 40 percent. The Minnesota Commission should heed \nChairman Christie’s warning and should carefully review the robust record built in this proceeding to \nmake its own decision under Minnesota Law as to whether the Proposed Acquisition is consistent with the Public Interest.  \n \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n \nOn balance, the risks of potential harm arising from the Proposed Acquisition outweigh its \npotential benefits. Therefore, the Proposed Acquisition is not consistent with the public interest, and \nthe Commission should deny its approval.  \n Dated: May  1, 202 5      Respectfully submitted,  \n         \n       /s/ Brian C.

Learn why this is important\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing on behalf of Onsite Solutions Group LLC to express our strong support for ALLETE\nand their ongoing acquisition process.\nAs a small northern Minnesota business that has worked closely with ALLETE for several\nyears, we have consistently experienced their unwavering commitment to partnering with\nlocal vendors and contributing positively to the regional economy. ALLETE has been\ninstrumental in helping businesses like ours grow and thrive, and their support goes farbeyond contractual obligations — they invest in relationships and in the long-term success of\ntheir community.\nIn every interaction, the ALLETE team has demonstrated integrity, professionalism, and a deep\nrespect for collaborative, community-minded business practices. They treat their partners as\ntrue stakeholders, fostering a spirit of cooperation that is rare and deeply appreciated.\nWe believe that the proposed acquisition — while a major change — will allow ALLETE to\nexpand its positive impact, not only maintaining its local focus but enhancing it throughgreater investment capacity and strategic alignment. We have full confidence that the company\nwill remain a strong and principled partner to the communities it serves, including local\nbusinesses like ours.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nSincerely,\nBrian Gustafson\nOwner - PresidentCell:  (218) 242-4945Brian@onsitesolutionsgroup.com\n \n\"Connecting  the people  with the purpose. \"\nwww.onsitesolutionsgroup.com"

As our consumer\nadvocate , Citizens Utility Board, notes:  BlackRock’s $11.5 trillion in assets under\nmanagement exceeds the GDP of every nation except the United States and China. Thoseincentives do not align\n with the public interest and will make it impossible to align\naffordability and reliability with the legally embedded mandate BlackRock has to extractprofits, and the abundant evidence that BlackRock has stripped other areas of community life(housing in particular) of value and financial buffer for the wellbeing of the users (householdsand energy users in this case). Not only that but most of the shareholders would beinternational, not local or regional. Wealth then is not only extracted but exported. For what?\nPlease do not condone or allow this. sincerely, Alice Madden\n55407"

As a trusted utility and community \npartner, they have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to responsible \nenergy delive ry, local leadership, and long -term investment in the economic and \nenvironmental well -being of northeast Minnesota.  \nWe care deeply about the continued strength and stability of Minnesota Power —\nnot only for what they represent as an energy provider, but for the critical role they \nplay in enabling growth and innovation across our business community. From \ninfrastructure de velopment to workforce support, their impact is wide -reaching and \nessential.  \nThe assurances that Minnesota Power’s headquarters, leadership, regulatory \noversight, values, and philanthropic efforts will remain intact provide confidence \nand continuity for the region. The key benefit of this acquisition —greater access to \ncapital —posit ions the company to more effectively meet state -mandated carbon -\nfree goals and fund the infrastructure investments necessary to modernize our \nenergy grid.  \nThis is not a departure from their mission, but a strategic move to strengthen it. In \na time when many rural and regional areas face uncertainty in energy and \neconomic development, Minnesota Power’s approach offers stability, growth, and \na clear path forwa rd. \nWe respectfully urge the Commission to approve this acquisition. Doing so will \nsupport a company that has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the \nNorthland and that remains poised to lead our region into a carbon -free, \neconomically vibrant future.  \nSincerely,  \n \nKim Parmeter  \nPresident & CEO"

    "content": "Drar Judge Megan J. MchengiI hope that the acquisition of ALLETE by CPP and GIP will not go forward.DEGEIVEByAPR 17 2025My husband David and I attended the Monday evening, April 7, 2025 public hearing inDuluth regarding the acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment (CPP) andGlobal Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which is owned by BlackRock. We appreciated beingable to listen to statements from citizens on both sides of this acquisition and weappreciated your professionalism and courtesy to all of us present. We listened carefullyfrom seats near the front, took a few notes, and went home to discuss our own reactions.During the week after this hearing, before my written response, I read about both CPP andGIP/BlackRock and my areas of concern were even more heightened, particularly having todo with the latter.I noticed at the hearing that most of the persons in favor of the acquisition were MinnesotaPower/ALLETE employees and labor union members. Their expectations of past andpresent job satisfaction and their trust in future employment under new ownership werereiterated. However, there are no guarantees in two short years that their job satisfaction oreven their employment will continue. Local control over all their employment futures willbe taken away. And losing local control of our public utilities management could haveserious and cascading effects upon our entire region, the LEAST of them being a (probablyguaranteed) rise in electrical rates. I confess: alarm bells go off for me.Various outside experts hired by the MN Department of Commerce and even the office ofthe Attorney General are critical of this acquisition by two huge private companies,particularly GIP. Groups such as Sierra Club, CURE, CUB, individuals and shareholdershave recommended that the Public Utilities Commission reject the deal. Both CPP andGIP's main argument for their acquisition is that ALLETE's goal of net-zero carbonemissions by 2040 can more easily be financially reached with them. But neither partner isforthcoming about their real future goals. MY biggest concern is that in ALLETE beingowned by a private company, who knows what will happen? I have far more trust in public,information-sharing companies who have access to public markets. I would not mindALLETE being in a limited partnership with CPP. (I would like to see us teaming with ourCanadian neighbors.) Iwould prefer ALLETE expand its public shareholder base, ratherthan be absorbed by the biggest profit entity in the world. (I would be willing to buy shares!)Do I trust GIP/BlackRock? No. I don't, frankly. Why do they want to acquire ALLETE? I don'tbelieve their goal is to help Minnesota achieve net-zero carbon emissions. I have beenfollowing this week's stories about the Panama Canal, and BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink,who is determined to gain control of Panama's main ports. Perhaps BlackRock is moreinterested in the fact that we are a port, than in helping with climate control. Maybe Fink ismore interested in controlling ten percent of the world's fresh water, or gaining mineralrights access. I do not trust this humongous, gobbling entity bent on profit and power.I keep coming back to this: Potential risks to consumers and protectors of our lakes,our lands, our waters, our grandchildren's futures outweigh any potential benefits.Lynn Tryggestad, 4101 Gladstone St., Duluth MN 55804, 218-341-7405Kyan Iryggestad Thenk,eyou"

Learn why this is important\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nAs former long-time employees of Allete/Minnesota Power, and as retirees who receive both a\npension and medical reimbursement from the company, we are writing to express our strongopposition to the proposed sale of Allete to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a subsidiaryof Blackrock, and the Canada Pension Plan Fund (CPP).\nWe are also current shareholders of Allete. However, if this deal is approved, all shareholders\n—ourselves included—will be forced to sell our shares. We will have no choice in the matter.That alone is deeply concerning, as it strips away the voice and investment of long-timeemployees, retirees, and individuals who believe in the company’s long-term mission and itsvalue to Minnesota communities.\nThis $6.2 billion sale is facing well-founded opposition from a diverse coalition of\nstakeholders, including consumer advocates, the mining and wood products industries, and theMinnesota Department of Commerce. The concerns are substantial and credible: increasedrates for customers, loss of local control, and a lack of transparency throughout the process.\nGIP and CPP argue that they are better positioned to fund Allete’s renewable energy transition\nand infrastructure needs. Yet testimony from financial and regulatory experts, including thoserepresenting the Minnesota Department of Commerce, disputes these claims. They cite a lackof evidence that the acquisition would improve access to capital or benefit ratepayers in anymeaningful way. In fact, the proposed transaction appears to pose significant risk of large rateincreases, speculative investment strategies, and an erosion of public oversight.\nFurthermore, we are disturbed by reports that GIP and CPP have avoided transparency during\nthese proceedings—refusing to answer questions fully, providing redacted responses, andlimiting meaningful public engagement. This lack of openness is not compatible with the trustand accountability required of a utility provider responsible for serving Minnesota homes andbusinesses.\nMinnesota Power is more than a utility—it’s part of the fabric of the state and the communities\nit serves. It should not be turned over to private equity interests with global portfolios andshort-term profit motives. We urge the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and allinvolved regulatory bodies to reject this acquisition and preserve Allete’s accountability to thepublic.\nSteve Maasch"

Learn why this is important\nI am a 16 year employee of ALLETE/MP and my home is in their service territory. I support the merger\nfor a few reasons and write to you after witnessing the Duluth hearing.This is my opinion, not on behalf of the company. The path of merger is the hard path with significant damage to the public and shareholders should itnot be approved. Starting this process puts ALLETE on a path to either succeed in a merger with favorable partners orbe taken over by another entity while vulnerable after failure. Regardless the stock holders would take a hit and the public would not have the benefit of low costaccess to capital. In the end, ALLETE will have to get the money somewhere. If I asked a bank or the stock market for double my net worth the interest rate would be very high. Thesame goes for ALLETE as it plans to meet the goal of green energy. From my perspective it is either merge with the right partner or be taken over by a merger we probablydon’t want negotiating from stock at 30.00 a share vs 67.00 If ALLETE is not successful, its likely that the culture I’ve known and trust will die at the hands of avulture style merger. I support the merger because it is the best chance to save the best company I’ve ever worked for andthe right thing for its customers long term. Chad Lander"

Learn why this is important\nIn reviewing the information made available I have serious concerns about the consumer\nimpact of the sale of MN Power. The continued increases in the cost of electricity  havebecome a major concern for us over the last few years.  While there are reasons, some merited,for these increases the impact is still the same:  given that many have no energy sourcealternative choice, if we want/need electrical service we are compelled to purchase it from MNPower.\nHowever, inasmuch as MN Power is more-or-less a \"local\" company, there is a perceived and\nperhaps some well-deserved trust in MN Power's sensitivity to the customer.  With the sale Isee no assurance that sensitivity will continue.  It seems that MN Power would become a place-of-profit division for the purchasers less than a customer-sensitive organisation providing anessential service.\nSimply put, no sale is the best option.\n-- Bruce PennerLifelong Customer1872 County Road 3Carlton, MN 55718"
