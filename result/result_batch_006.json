Learn why this is important\nI realize I am late to post a comment but please submit this. I have two points on the purchase of\nBlackrock of MN Power that are relevant.  It is obvious Blackrock is looking at an AI data center requiringa renewable energy outbuild since Mn Power's revenue from mining is declining.  Despite HF 16mandating a data center pay upfront for new energy facilities there still could be a cost to rate payers forwhat is determined a \"system benefit\".  This would be 'regressive progress'. The AI data center shouldalso pay for the 'system benefit' for taxpayers as well based on FERC's foundational doctrine of \"Thosewho cause costs to be incurred should bear those costs\".  That is number 1.  Number two is that the new\ndata center should provide a percentage of their services for 'open source'--say 10% which might include\nsoftware and transparent architecture since they are being given access to water, space for solar, windfarms, and labor force for the public, academia, media as a free public service."

    "content": "Staﬀ IR Request (PUC14 - PUC 3 2) \nHeadquarters  \nIn the initial ﬁling  ALLETE  provided Attachment B which was entitled “AGREEMENT AND PLAN \nOF MERGER by and among ALLETE, INC., ALLOY PARENT LLC and ALLOY MERGER SUB LLC” dated \nMay 5, 2024 . On page 66 of that agreement Section 6.06(b)(i)(1) it states:  \n“Headquarters. The Company will continue to maintain the headquarters of its regulated businesses in Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin.”  \nAfter the separation that is proposed in 1.27 it is presume d Minnesota Power will be designated \nto be the Minnesota regulated entity and Superior Water Light & Power will be designated to be \na Wisconsin regulated entity.  \n14. Will ALLETE  or its subsidiary retain transmission and generation assets not within these \ntwo entities, but potentially still regulated by FERC or other jurisdictions?   \n15. Would entities managing these assets be considered “regulated businesses” under the \nMay 5, 2024  agreement ? \n16. If these entities  are “regulated entities” pursuant to the agreement and those entities’ \nheadquarters were removed from Duluth, who would have standing to bring an action \nto enforce the agreement, what would be the speciﬁc action, what venue would such \naction be brought in, and what would be any anticipated remedies for a breach of the \nagreement?  \n17. Is there a common accepted understanding regarding the term “headquarters” or \n“headquartered” as use d in the Initial Filing, the May 5, 2024 agreement , and the July 11 \nSettlement Stipulation? Please provide what ALLETE  and the Partners understand these \nterms to mean . \n18. If ALLETE  or the Partners  were to violate  paragraph 1.67 of the July 11 Settlement \nStipulation , who would have standing to bring an action to enforce the agreement, what \nwould be the speciﬁc action?   \n19. what venue would such action be brought in, and what would be any anticipated \nremedies for a breach of the  settlement stipulation regarding Minnesota Power’s \nheadquarters ? \nWorkforce and Labor Protections Enforcement  \nIn the July 11 Settlement Stipulation , Petitioners made commitments regarding “ Workforce and \nLabor Protections ” at paragraphs 1.56 to 1.62 including but not limited to prevailing wages, not \nto lay  oﬀ employees, not to remove the existing leadership team, and not to reduce spending \non the local community.  \n20. For each of these paragraphs , identify how these commitments are enforceable.   \n21. Who has standing to bring an action to enforce each of these speciﬁc commitments ? \n22.  What would be the speciﬁc action, what venue s would such actions  be brought in?  \n23.  What would be any anticipated remedies for a breach of the  speciﬁc settlement \nstipulation ? \nIn the  July 11 Settlement Stipulation , Petitioners made a commitment regarding continued \nfunding of economic development activities at 1.66. It stated:  \n“For as long as Minnesota Power is owned by the Partners, Minnesota Power will \nmaintain historical levels of economic development in the State of Minnesota. ”  \n24. How  are ALLETE  and the Partners deﬁning  “historic levels” for comparison  to future \nspending ? \n25.  Is there a speciﬁc annual dollar amount or will that be determined on the date of \nclosing?  \n26. How will it be determined and will it be speciﬁcally noted in a compliance ﬁling to the Commission  after closing ? \n27.  Who has standing to bring an action to enforce this speciﬁc commitment, what would \nbe the speciﬁc action, what venues would such actions be brought in, and what would \nbe any anticipated remedies for a breach of this speciﬁc settlement stipulation?  \nSale of Land o r Other Real Property  \nMinnesota Power in Docket No. E015/PA -20-675 made several commitments regarding the sale \nof excess land connected to its Hydro facilities in St. Louis County. In particular , Minnesota \nPower committed to refund and credit to customers either in a future rate case or through the \nRenewable Resources Rider all the proceeds from the sale regardless of whether they were in rate base or shareholder assets. These commitments involved actions through 2028 to close on the sale of these properties .  \n28. Why is paragraph 1.45 in the July 11 Settlement Stipulation needed if ratepayers  were \ngoing to be credited with these proceeds  under this prior commitment ?  \n29. Are the signers to the July 11 Settlement Stipulation  intending that this “bill credit” will \nbe something diﬀerent than the obligations already committed to by ALLETE  and \nMinnesota Power in Docket No. E015/PA -20-675? If so, what is the intent and will it be \nto ratepayer beneﬁt?  \nIn the July 11 Settlement Stipulation , ALLETE  and the Partners  committed to handling the sale of \nland or other Real property in paragraph 1.46  as follows:  \n“Within 60 days of closing of any sale of land or other real property that was included in \nrate base, excluding existing proceeds from land sales identiﬁed in Docket No. E015/PA -\n20-675, Minnesota Power shall submit a plan to the Commission to credit any fu ture \nproceeds to ratepayers. ” \n30. Is it the intent of the signatories that , in all future surplus land and other real property \ntransactions where their property is partially in rate base and partially held for the \nshareholders, as was the case in Docket No. E015/PA -20-675 for the Hydro land sale, all \nof the proceeds will be credited to ratepayers as was done for the Hydro land sales in \nDocket No. E015/PA -20-675?  \n31.  Is there an estimate of surplus land or other real property that has been designated for \nsale to be included under this provision at this time?  \n32. If so, is there an estimate of the property value and what portion is presently in rate base? If there is some other intent of this provision , please provide greater detail."

    "content": "Staff  Information Request  (PUC -Nos. 33 -36) \n \n33. The Partners have committed to retain ALLETE /MP’s current workforce for two years \nincluding maintaining the current senior management of ALLETE /MP as part of the \nsettlement stipulation submitted to the Commission by the Department of \nCommerce on July 11, 2025.  \nRequest:  \na) Why was the retention period for the current workforce agreed to not ten (10) \nyears or at the least ﬁve (5) years?  \nb) What happens at the expiration of IBEW Local 31  Collective Bargaining \nAgreement  in January 2028?  \nc) What is the average number of years of commitment to retain the workforce \nof an acquired utility company in a typical  acquisition transaction by an \nEquity investment ﬁrm?  \n34. The Partners stated that they are committed to maintaining ALLETE/MP headquarters in Duluth for the long term . \nRequest:  \na) What is the minimum time period in years the Partners intend to retain Duluth, Minnesota as the headquarters of ALLETE /MP?  \ni. 5 years  \nii. 10 years  \niii. 15 years  \n35. Considering  MP’ s latest rate case settlement and the current  Acquisition process \nwhich likely will not be ﬁnalized until  late 2025, the likelihood of MP being able to ﬁle \na rate case with the Commission at the end of 2025 absent the commitment \nappears low.  \nRequest : \na) Explain in detail why a stay out from ﬁling a rate case for at minimum  ﬁve (5) \nyears would not be reasonable . \nb) Identify any  measurable beneﬁt s that would accrue  to ratepayers from MP \nﬁling a rate case  in 2026.  \nc) Comparing ﬁling a rate case in 2026 and 2030, which of the two would provide more measurable beneﬁts to ratepayers and align better with public \ninterest?  \n36. The Clean Firm Technology per Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 1(b) , means a carbon \nfree resource , that can be dispatched and provide energy continuously 50 0r more \nhours. The Partners committed Alloy Parent to invest $50 million in a clean ﬁrm \ntechnology fund that would be created by MP . Alloy Parent would pay $16.67  million \ninstallment s to the fund every two years until the fund reaches the $50 million mark.  \nThe Agreement with the Department stated that contributions would not be \nrecoverable . \nRequest:  \na) What would this money be spent on in the short -term in the next 5 years?  \nb) Are there any speciﬁc projects earmarked for this fund?  \nc) Why are the Partners (CPP and GIP/BlackRock) not directly responsible for \ncontributing to the fund instead of using the Alloy  Parent? \nd) Please e xplain why it cannot be expected that Alloy Parent  would take on \nmore debt to contribute to the fund , thereby resulting in larger rate increase \nrequests . \ne) Explain in detail how the costs of projects  ﬁnanced by contributions to clean \nﬁrm technology fund would be recovered ."

    "Received Date ": "08/28/2025",
    "content": "August  27, 2025 \n \nMr. Mike  Bull                   \nActing  Executive  Secretary  \nMinnesota  Public Utilities  Commission  \nSuite  350  \n121-  7th Place  East  \nSt. Paul,  MN 55101 - 2147 \n \nDear  Mr. Bull,  \n \nI write  on behalf  of Minnesota  AFL -CIO  to urge  the Minnesota  Public Utilities  Commission  to approve the proposed  sale  of \nALLETE  to infrastructure  investment  funds managed  by Global Infrastructure Partners  and  the Canadian  Pension Plan  \nInvestment  Board. The Minnesota  AFL -CIO  represents  1,000 local unions, representing, 300,000 union members, including  \nmultiple  thousands  of men  and  women  that  live and  work  in Northeast  Minnesota. ALLETE  and  Minnesota  Power  have  \nplayed an important role  in the lives  of union households  in Northeast  Minnesota  for generations  — delivering  reliable  \npower, creating  family -supporting  jobs,  and  fostering  economic  development.  \n \nThe unions  most  directly  affected  by the Commission’s  decision  in this  case  — including  International  Brotherhood  of \nElectrical Workers  Local  31 and  unions  affiliated  with  the Minnesota  Building  Trades  — have  taken  a hard  look  and  \nconcluded  that  the sale  is the best  way  to protect  their  members’  interests  in a healthy, well -functioning  utility.  The  \nMinnesota  AFL -CIO  agrees. The modest  and  manageable  risks  associated  with  the proposed  sale  are far outweighed  by \nthe risks  Northeast  Minnesotans  face  if ALLETE  is forced  to go it alone. Additional  commitments  negotiated  by Local  31, \nthe Minnesota  Department  of Commerce and  Energy  Cents  Coalition  further ensure  that  the sale  is consistent  with  the \npublic interest.  \n Like  other investor- owned  utilities,  Minnesota  Power is subject  to democratic  oversight  through the Commission,  which  \nlimits  the rates  utilities  charge and  the profits  they  earn; requires  them  to operate in a transparent  manner for the benefit  of \nthe public;  and  provides  extensive opportunities  for public participation  in planning. None of these rules  and  requirements  \nchange if ownership  of the utility  changes  from  stockholders  to infrastructure investors, whose funding  comes  largely  from  \npublic and  labor -management  pension funds.  \n \nComments  submitted  by the Minnesota  Building  and  Construction Trades  Council  detail  the danger to working  people  if \nMinnesota  Power were forced  to rely  on third  parties  for power generation and  other essential  functions  because  the utility  \nlacked access  to affordable  capital.  The Minnesota  AFL -CIO  recognizes  the critical  importance of keeping  control  over \ncritical  infrastructure in the hands  of regulated  entities,  and  we are concerned  that  excess ive reliance on unregulated  third  \nparties  could compromise  the integrity  of the system,  weaken democratic  control  and  oversight, and  undermine the \neconomic  and  social  gains  that  Minnesota  Power has  historically  delivered.  \n \nThe best  way  to prevent  these harms  and  to protect  the progress  we\n have  made  is to ensure that  Minnesota  Power  has  the \nnecessary  resources  to build  the clean, reliable  energy  system  we need. This  is especially  true  at a time  when we face  \neconomic  uncertainty  and  almost  daily  attacks  from  the current  administration  on working  people, and  on Minnesota’s  \nplans  for a just  energy  transition. We thank  the Commission  for its attention  and  ask you  to approve the proposed  \ntransaction. \n  \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \nBernie Burnham      Brad  Lehto  \nPresident      Secretary/Treasurer"
