My business address is 16690 Swingley Ridge Road, Suite  140, 3 \nChesterfield, MO 63017. 4 \nQ\n ARE YOU THE SAME CHRISTOPHER C. WALTERS WHO PREVIOUSLY 5 \nFILED DIRECT TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF LARGE POWER 6 \nINTERVENORS (“LPI”) IN THIS PROCEEDING ? 7 \nA Yes, I am . 8 \nQ\n WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR SURREBUTTAL TESTIMONY?  9 \nA The purpose of my Surrebuttal Testimony is  to respond to the rebuttal testimonies of 10 \ncertain witnesses and further demonstrate that the ALLETE, Global Infrastructure 11 \nPartners (“GIP”), and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP”), (GIP and 12 \nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 2 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. CPP, the “Partners” and all together, “Joint Applicants ”) have failed to meet their 1 \nburden of proof. 2 \n \nII.  SUMMARY  3 \nQ PLEASE SUMMARIZE YOUR SURREBUTTAL TESTIMONY . 4 \nA T he acquisition  proposed by the Joint Applicants (“Proposed Acquisition”)  is entirely 5 \npremised upon an outsized capital investment plan.  My testimony explains that the Joint 6 \nApplicants have not met their burden of proof to demonstrate the capital investment 7 \nplan underpinning the proposed Acquisition is in the public interest.  Instead, the 8 \nPartners  have merely shown it is in their interest to invest billions of dollars to drive up 9 \nrate base and earn significant projected returns  at the expense of Minnesotans.  T o 10 \nachieve their outsized returns, the Partners  need to invest at a pace incomparable to 11 \nhistoric investments , and they assume the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission 12 \n(“Commission ”) will authorize their planned investments.  If the Commission instead 13 \nslows the projected pace of investments , it is possible, if not likely , the Partners  will 14 \ncease investing in Minnesota Power and seek a new buyer so they can invest in more 15 \nlucrative endeavors that will yield the return they are projecting in this Proposed 16 \nAcquisition.  In either case, customers lose – either via skyrocketing rates or via another 17 \nacquisition of Minnesota P ower , with the potential to be riskier than the current 18 \nProposed Acquisition .  The Commission should act now to deny the Application and 19 \nprotect customers and Minnesotans from the lose/lose situation of unaffordable rates or 20 \nanother risky and uncertain acquisition.  21 \nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 3 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. III.  THE PROPROSED TRANSACTION IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST  1 \nA. The Joint Applicants Haves Not Met The ir Burden of Proof  2 \nQ HAVE THE JOINT APPLICANTS  PROVIDED QUANTIFIABLE, TANGIBLE 3 \nBENEFITS TO RATEPAYERS THAT WOULD OUTWEIGH THE RISKS AND 4 \nJUSTIFY APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION? 5 \nA No.  Despite multiple opportunities, neither Minnesota Power nor the Partners have 6 \nprovided any quantifiable analysis, concrete studies, or detailed financial modeling 7 \ndemonstrating measurable net customer benefits from the proposed transaction.  8 \nInstead, their testimonies of all of the representatives of the Joint Applicants continue 9 \nto offer generalized assurances of improved capital access and unspecified strategic 10 \nalignment, which remain speculative and intangible .  The lack of quantifiable, tangible 11 \nbenefits to ratepayers, is reiterated in the response to LPI IR 109.1   12 \n \nQ WHY IS IT IMPORTANT THAT THE SUPPOSED BENEFITS  OF THE 13 \nTRANSACTION BE TANGIBLE AND QUANTIFIABLE ? 14 \nA It is critical because the burden of proof rests on the Joint Applicants to show concrete 15 \nbenefits clearly aligned with the public interest standard required for regulatory 16 \napproval.  Without quantifiable evidence of actual customer savings, rate reductions, 17 \noperational synergies, or  improved reliability, the Commission cannot reasonably 18 \nconclude the transaction provides benefits sufficient to outweigh the inherent risks and 19 \ncosts .2 20 \n \n1 Minnesota Power Response to LPI IR 109 (attached hereto as Schedule 1).  \n2 To find a transaction within the public interest under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, the Commission has looked \nfor Applicants to provide evidence of lower energy costs for ratepayers, improved efficiencies and synergies, \nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 4 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. Q THE JOINT APPLICANTS CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE THE SEEMINGLY 1 \nUNFETTERED SUPPLY OF CAPITAL THE PARTNERS BRING TO THE 2 \nTABLE AS A BENEFIT OF THE TRANSACTION.  HOW DO YOU RESPOND?  3 \nA As an initial matter, the continued emphasis of the unfettered supply of capital 4 \nunderscores that the P roposed Acquisition and the capital investment plan are one and 5 \nthe same – ALLETE would not have approached GIP and CPP without the alleged need 6 \nfor the capital investment plan and GIP and CPP would not be acquiring ALLETE but 7 \nfor the financial rewards associated with the capital investment plan.  But there is no 8 \ndemonstration that this significant capital investment plan is consistent with the public 9 \ninterest or that it would  not be better moderated via the traditional controls of regulation 10 \nthrough access to the capital markets.  Further, I am unaware of the Company having 11 \ntrouble accessing the capital markets.  For example, even after it was previously 12 \ndowngraded in 2020, S&P noted “ALLETE has sound relationships with its banks, and 13 \na satisfactory standing in the credit markets .”3   14 \n \n \nenhanced reliability, increased economies of scale, and other tangible ratepayer benefits.  E.g., In the Matter of \nOtter Tail Power Company’s Petition for Approval of a Transfer of Property , MPUC Docket No. E -017/PA -21-\n793, Order Approving Petition and Requiring Compliance Filing at 3- 4 (Oct. 24, 2022) ; In the Matter of Proposed \nMerger of Minnegasco, Inc. with and into Arkla, Inc., MPUC Docket No. G -008/PA -90-604, Order Approving \nMerger and Adopting Amended Stipulation with Modifications at 4 (Nov. 27, 1990) ; In the Matter of the \nApplication of Northern States Power Company for Approval to Merge with New Century Energies, Inc ., MPUC \nDocket No. E, G -002/PA -99-1031, Order Approving Merger, As Conditioned at 11- 12 (Jun. 12, 2000) ; In the \nMatter of the Petition by Northern States Power Company for Approval of the Acquisition of the Mower County \nWind Facility,  MPUC Docket No. E -002/PA -19-553, Order Approving Acquisition of Mower County Wind \nFacility, Approving Variance, and Taking Other Action at 6 (Nov. 5, 2020) (finding Xcel met its burden to \ndemonstrate consistency with the public interest on the basis that the Project would provide ongoing, tangible \nbenefits to ratepayers and the public).  \n3 S&P RatingsDirect, “Research Update: ALLETE Inc. Downgraded To 'BBB' On Expected Weaker \nFinancial Measures; Outlook Stable ,” April 22, 2020.  \nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 5 \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – H IGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. Q HAS THE UTILITY INDUSTRY IN GENERAL BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS 1 \nCAPITAL TO FUND SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS?  2 \nA Yes, the utility industry has been readily able to access significant capital in the last ten 3 \nyears and it is expected that access will continue .  In its October  22, 2024, Utility Capital 4 \nExpenditures report, RRA Financial Focus , a division of S&P Global Market 5 \nIntelligence, made several relevant comments about utility investments generally:4 6 \n•Energy utility capex estimates for 2025, 2026 and 2027 indicate 7 \nsuccessively higher spending levels, reaching $192 billion, $196.5 8 \nbillion and $197 billion, respectively.  Spending in these years is 9 \nlikely to increase further, as the companies’ plans for future projects 10 \ncontinue to solidify around federal and state legislation supporting 11 \ninfrastructure investment. 12 \n•Multiple drivers are expected to elevate utility capital expenditures 13 \nover the next several years.   Pent-up demand to replace aging 14 \nequipment is already pushing utilities to make considerable 15 \ninvestments in infrastructure.  Meanwhile, the renewable energy 16 \nportfolio standards for multiple states continue to ramp up, with the 17 \nplans specifying large expansions of low -carbon energy generation 18 \ncapacity. 19 \n•Forecast aggregate utility investments in 2025, 2026 and 2027 are 20 \nexpected to reach new records .  The increases are being driven in 21 \nlarge part by federal legislation enacted in 2021 and 2022, supporting 22 \ninfrastructure investment and state -level energy transition plans and 23 \nincentives, as well as robust growth in demand from datacenters, as 24 \nthe explosion in implementation of AI and cloud computing 25 \ncontinues. 26 \nA\ns shown in Figure CCW -1, capital expenditures for the regulated electric and 27 \nnatural gas delivery utilities have increased considerably over the period 2023 into 2024, 28 \nand the forecasted capital expenditures remain elevated  through the end of 2026. 29 \n4S&P Global Market Intelligence,  Regulatory Research Associates’ (“RRA”) Financial Focus : “Utility \ncapital expenditures update,” October 22, 2024.  \nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 6 \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – H IGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. A\ns demonstrated in Figure CCW -1 above, and in the comments made by S&P 1 \nGlobal RRA Regulatory Focus , capital investments for the utility industry continue to 2 \nstay at elevated levels, and these capital expenditures are expected to fuel utilities’ profit 3 \ngrowth into the foreseeable future.  This is clear evidence that utilities’ significant 4 \ncapital programs are attracting capital to the utility industry in a manner that allows for 5 \nfunding these elevated capital investments.  While capital markets embrace these capital 6 \ninvestments, regulatory commissions also must be careful to maintain reasonable prices , 7 \ntariff terms , and conditions to protect customers’ need for reliable utility service at 8 \nreasonable rates.  If this is not done, utility rates will expand beyond the ability of 9 \ncustomers to pay, resulting in revenue constraints for utilities, which will impact their 10 \nfinancial integrity .   11 \n\nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 7 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. Q IS THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION EXPECTED TO MITIGATE RISK OR 1 \nREDUCE THE COST OF CAPITAL FOR MINNESOTA POWER?  2 \nA No.  As Witness Bulkley testified, the Proposed Acquisition is unlikely to materially 3 \nmitigate risks or reduce Minnesota Power's cost of capital.5  In fact, it may increase 4 \nfinancial risk and the cost of capital, as other witnesses have testified .6  S&P has 5 \nexpressed concern with the post -acquisition credit quality of ALLETE and put the 6 \nCompany on a negative outlook in May 2024.  That outlook remains “Negative” to this 7 \nday.  S&P stated as follows: “The negative outlook reflects the possibility for higher 8 \nleverage and weaker financial measures because of the acquisition.  We could lower our 9 \nratings on ALLETE if its leverage increases and its financial measures weaken such that 10 \nits funds from operations (FFO) to debt falls below 17%.”7  11 \n  In addition, the Partners seemingly expect [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 12 \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …    \n   \n  \n    \n  \n 18 \n \n5 See Bulkley Direct at 10 . \n6 E.g., Baker Direct at 2 (“I conclude that private equity ownership of Minnesota Power may be a more \nexpensive way to raise capital than through public market because of the high target  annual return and cash yield \nexpected to be paid out to GIP Fund V investors, which may impact the public interest of the transaction.”)  \n7 S&P RatingsDirect, “Research Update: ALLETE Inc. Outlook Revised to  Negative On Proposed \nAcquisition By Infrastructure Funds, Ratings Affirmed, ” May 7, 2024.  \n8 [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …   \n… HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS] . \n\nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 8 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC.   \n… HIGHL\nY 2 \nCONFI\nDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS] . 3 \n \nQ BASED ON THE FOREGOING, SHOULD THE COMMISSION FEEL 4 \nCOMPELLED TO APPROVE THE PROPOSED  ACQUISITION? 5 \nA No.  The Commission should not feel compelled to approve the Proposed Acquisition.  6 \nOther jurisdictions have denied similar proposals due to insufficient demonstration of 7 \ncustomer benefits and unacceptable risk to customers. 8 \n Q WHAT OTHER COMMISSIONS REJECTED PROPOSED UTILITY 9 \nACQUISITIONS FOR NOT BEING CONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC 10 \nINTEREST OR PROVIDING  NET BENEFITS TO RATEPAYERS?  11 \nA For example, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) denied 12 \nthe proposed merger between Hydro One and Avista in Docket No. U -170970, 13 \nspecifically citing a lack of quantifiable customer benefits, insufficient operational 14 \nsynergies, and significant risks to ratepayers as reasons for the denial.\n10  Similarly, the 15 \nNew Mexico Public Regulation Commission  (NMPRC) denied the proposed transaction 16 \nbetween Avangrid and PNM in Case No. 20 -00222- UT.  In its Order on Certification of 17 \nStipulation , the NMPRC denied the merger application, concluding that the potential 18 \n \n9 [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …   \n… HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS] . \n10 In the Matter of the Joint Application of Hydro One Limited and Avista Corporation for Approval of \nMerger Agreement, Case Nos. AVU -E-17-09 and AVU -G-17-05, Order No. 34226 (Jan. 3, 2019).  \n\nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 9 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. risks outweighed the proposed benefits, and thus, the merger was not consistent with 1 \nthe public interest.11 2 \n \nQ SPECIFICALLY, WHAT DID THE WASHINGTON UTC CONCLUDE 3 \nREGARDING QUANTIFIABLE BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED HYDRO 4 \nONE -AVISTA MERGER? 5 \nA The Washington UTC concluded explicitly that the a pplicants failed to demonstrate 6 \nquantifiable and tangible customer benefits.  The UTC emphasized that the proposed 7 \nbenefits were marginal, speculative, and inadequate to satisfy the required public 8 \ninterest standard.  The UTC concluded there would be “ few, if any, synergies arising 9 \nfrom the proposed merger particularly in the short -term, ” and that the applicants failed 10 \nto demonstrate any material, quantifiable cost savings or efficiencies beneficial to 11 \ncustomers . 12 \n Q ULTIMATELY, WHY DID THE WASHINGTON UTC FIND THAT THE 13 \nHYDRO ONE -AVISTA MERGER FAILED THE PUBLIC INTEREST 14 \nSTANDARD?  15 \nA The UTC found that the risks of political interference, insufficient financial protections, 16 \ninadequate governance structures, and lack of tangible, quantifiable benefits clearly 17 \ndemonstrated the transaction was not consistent with the public interest standard 18 \nrequired for regulatory approval. 19 \n \n11 In the Matter of the Joint Application of Avangrid., Inc., et al for Approval of the Merger of NM Green \nHoldings, Inc. with PNM Resources, Inc.,  Case No. 20 -00222- UT, Order on Certification of Stipulation at 20  (Dec. \n8, 2021).  \nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 10 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. Q WHAT DID THE NMPRC CONCLUDE REGARDING POTENTIAL RISKS 1 \nAND COMPORTANCE WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST?  2 \nA The NMPRC evaluated six factors, as applied to the proposed t ransaction, to determine 3 \nwhether the merger would satisfy the public interest under NMSA 1978, § 62-6-12, and 4 \nconcluded the potential harms of the proposed transaction outweighed the benefits.  5 \n \nQ WHY DID THE NMPRC FIND THAT THE AVANGRID AND PNM  MERGER 6 \nFAILED THE PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARD?  7 \nA Ultimately, the NMPRC determined the proposed t ransaction did not comport with the 8 \npublic interest because the potential harms resulting from the proposed t ransaction did 9 \nnot outweigh its benefits.  There, the a pplicants contended the proposed t ransaction 10 \nwould result in benefits to  ratepayers ( i.e., $1.64 per month for three years for residential 11 \nratepayers), senior management ( “golden parachutes for three PNMR/PNM Executives 12 \nequaling more than $29 million far exceeds the amount all residential ratepayers will 13 \nreceive”), and “hundreds of millions to shareholders .”12  However, the NMPRC found 14 \nthe application glossed over the proposed t ransaction’s “potential risks” and simply 15 \n“recast as additional enhanced benefits” those risks rather than making needed 16 \nrevisions.13  Such harms included concerns with quality -of-service issues and risks for 17 \nimproper subsidization of non- utility activities.14 18 \n \n12 NMPRC Order on Stipulation at 12.  \n13 Id. at 14.  \n14 Id. at 15.  \nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 11 \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – H IGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. Q ARE THERE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE PROPOSED 1 \nACQUISITION IN THE IMMEDIATE PROCEEDING AND THE 2 \nAVISTA/HYDRO ONE AND/OR THE AVANGRID/PNM TRANSACTIONS ? 3 \nA Yes.  As noted above, the UTC concluded, in part, that i nsufficient financial protections, 4 \ninadequate governance structures, and lack of tangible, quantifiable benefits clearly 5 \ndemonstrated the transaction was not consistent with the public interest standard.  6 \nSimilarly, the NMPRC concluded explicitly that the proposed transaction’ s potential 7 \nrisks outweighed its claimed benefits, thus failing the public interest standard.  As 8 \nexplained in my direct testimony, and throughout this testimony, the Proposed 9 \nAcquisition  in this proceeding has insufficient financial protections, inadequate 10 \ngovernance structures, and a  lack of tangible, quantifiable benefits .  Based on the 11 \naforementioned, and the balance of this testimony, it can be concluded that the potential 12 \nrisks outweigh any claimed benefits , resulting in a transaction that is inconsistent with 13 \nthe public interest.   14 \nB. T\nhe Proposed Acquisition Is Too Expensive, Assumes Excessive Rates,  and Will Harm 15 \nthe Public Interest  16 \nQ WHAT ABOUT THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION MAKES IT TOO 17 \nEXPENSIVE ? 18 \nA There are a few aspects that make the Proposed Acquisition too expensive as proposed. 19 \nFirst, there is a significant acquisition premium being paid by the Partners.  While they 20 \ncommit to not recovering it directly through rates as part of MP’s cost of service, there 21 \nwill likely be pressure to reduce operational expenses, and increase rates through 22 \nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 12 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. various means ( e.g., a higher ROE, affiliate transactions, etc .) to chip away at and 1 \nrecover  the premium paid .  The partners are unlikely to allow for that premium to be 2 \nabsorbed by themselves  and they could reduce staff and defer necessary maintenance, 3 \nwhile simultaneously raising rates .   4 \nSecond, the capital expenditures forecast by ALLETE and the Partners show  5 \ninvestment levels in excess of [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET 6 \nINFORMATION BEGINS …   \n … HIGHLY 8 \nCONFI\nDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS] .  The Company and 9 \nthe Partners have made it abundantly clear that Minnesota Power needs more capital 10 \nover the next 10- 15 years  than it has ever needed before , over the entirety of its 11 \nexistence.  Based in part on the massive investment they intend to make to rate base, 12 \nGIP has advertised that the GIP Fund V is targeting a 15-20% annual return.16 13 \nThe Petitioners attribute much or all of the unprecedented investment they intend 14 \nto make as required to meet the objective of complying with the Carbon Free Standard 15 \n(CFS) and its timeline to be coal- free by 2035 and carbon- free by 2040.  Throughout its 16 \napplication and multiple rounds of testimony, ALLETE and the Partners seem to gloss 17 \nover the fact that the Minnesota legislature envisioned an offramp from the CFS might 18 \nbe needed to keep rates from spiraling out of control and maintaining some semblance 19 \nof affordab ility.  In response to LPI IR 112, the Joint Applicants refer us to the Rebuttal 20 \n \n15 [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n \n… HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS] . \n16 See Baker Direct at  21, n . 57. \n\nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 13 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. Testimony of Witness Bram at 56:36-57:40 and the Rebuttal Testimony of Witness 1 \nAlley at 51:9 -16 for affordability- related commitments of the Company and the 2 \nPartners.17  The commitments, as provided in the referenced testimonies focus solely on 3 \nthe residential rate class.  There is not a single commitment to ensuring affordable rates 4 \nfor the industrial customers that make up more than two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s 5 \nenergy sales, the vast majority of which are LPI members.

A No.  Witnesses Cady, Taran, Alley, and Scissons reference affordability repeatedly but 1 \nprovide no actionable or measurable commitments ensuring rate affordability for 2 \ncustomers, especially large load and industrial customers whose competitiveness 3 \ndepends heavily on utility rates .  As I explained in my Direct testimony, Minnesota 4 \nPower’s industrial rates are already woefully failing to achieve  the goal set forth in 5 \nMinn.

The witnesses fail to identify thresholds or even clarify precisely how they 11 \ndefine affordability.  Absent specific affordability targets, mitigation plans, or concrete 12 \nanalyses of ratepayer impacts, the representations  made are meaningless .  Instead, what 13 \nis far more likely, are the assertions, plans, and projections on rates set forth in Partners’  14 \nredacted investor presentations. 15 \n Q WHAT CUSTOMER RATE INCREASES DO THE PARTNERS PROJECT?  16 \nA The Partners project customer rate increases of approximately [HIGHLY 17 \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …   \n … HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION 19 \nENDS].

The magnitude of proposed rate 17 \nincreases from the Partners’ and Company’s own forecasts vastly exceeds any 18 \nreasonable affordability standard or inflation metric as it relates to customer rates.  This 19 \nfundamental concern about extraordinary and unsustainable rate increases is not 20 \n19 [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS … \n … HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS] . \n\nChristopher C. Walters \nPage 17 \n \n[PUBLIC DOCUMENT – HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA  EXCISED ] \n \nBRUBAKER & ASSOCIATES , INC. resolved by Mr. Taran’s critique of one illustrative metric.  In response to LPI IR 114, 1 \nMr. Taran refers me to the 2022 Commission Electric Rate Comparison presentation  2 \nwhich shows that Minnesota has the highest Industrial rates in the Midwest region and 3 \nis at 114% of National Average for industrial customers.20  It shows that Minnesota 4 \nPower’s industrial electric prices have escalated at a rate only exceeded by Xcel Energy.  5 \nThe base case plan for the Partners exacerbates this issue and they have provided 6 \nnothing as far as commitments to help mitigate the risks of rates spiraling out of control.   7 \nMr. Taran asserts that my concerns appear to be more with Minnesota’s policy 8 \nrequirements, established by the Legislature and the Commission, and not with 9 \nALLETE’s plans to meet those requirements.  What Mr. Taran fails to acknowledge or 10 \nunderstand is that the entire motivation of the Proposed Acquisition  is financial in nature 11 \nand the Partners have made absolutely no commitments or assurances that rates can and 12 \nwill spiral out of control and simply defer the decision making to the Commission.   13 \nFurther, in response to LPI IR 116, we were referred to Table 1 on page 15 of 14 \nMs. Cady’s rebuttal testimony which alleges to show that in recent cases where electric 15 \nutilities transitioned from being publicly traded to privately owned, electric rates did not 16 \nmeaningfully increase and in many cases were better than comparable average rates.21  17 \nMs. Cady fails to mention  the significant amount of rate credits that were required in 18 \norder for the transactions to be approved by the regulatory commissions and ultimately 19 \ncompleted.  20 \n \n20 Minnesota Power Response to LPI IR 114 (attached hereto as Schedule 1).  \n21 Minnesota Power Response to LPI IR 116 (attached hereto as Schedule 1).  \nChristopher C.

For example, Ms. Cady’s table shows that in New Mexico, El Paso Electric’s 1 \nrates have realized a CAGR of (3.4%) compared to a +3.4% average for IOUs since 2 \n2020 when El Paso Electric was acquired by Infrastructure Investments Fund.

PLEASE EXPLAIN.  4 \nA Customers face two adverse scenarios: either significant rate increases from aggressive 5 \ninvestment approved by the Commission or instability if the Commission curtails the 6 \nPartners’ investment ambitions, prompting investor withdrawal or divestment and 7 \nleading to disruptive corporate and operational uncertainty. 8 \n \nIV.

As explained in the first part of the se ntence included on the lines \nreferenced in this request (lines 12 -14) and elsewhere in the testimony of Witnesses Bram and \nAlley, the value of ALLETE depends in large part on Minnesota Power’s ability to continue to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electricity service to customers, as well as its ability to meet the Carbon Free Standard established by the State of Minnesota.  Increases in the value of \nALLETE result in part from Minnesota Power’s investments in renewable energy, carbon-\nreduction, grid resiliency and reliability, and clean -energy enabling technologies, all of which the \nState of Minnesota has determined are in the public interest.  Increases in ALLETE’s value also can be based in part on Minnesota Power’s investments in ongoing base capit al needs to meet \nsafety, environmental, regulatory, and reliability objectives.  These too benefit customers directly and, like the other benefits listed above, are a benefit of the improved access to capital provided \nby the Acquisition.

This document was prepared by GIP for its investment committee in May 2024 and \nwas presented to the investment committee of GIP Fund V as part of its final decision to make an investment in \nALLETE. The materials prepared for GIP’s investment committee are customary for any initial investment that GIP \nis considering making through its funds and include valuation information and highlight risks, challenges and \nopportunities related to a particular investment, including a range of potential outcomes, which are  based on \nassumptions the deal team professionals deem appropriate for a particular transaction. However, these materials \nrepresent and are based on projections, ranges of understanding, and scenario planning by GIP based on the \ninformation available at the time, in many cases predating the undertaking or completion of due di ligence. As \nsuch, the  projections are not certain, include outlier scenarios, and are not necessarily scenarios that GIP expects to \nhappen. Once an investment decision has been made, th e materials and risks, projections and other analysis are \nnot updated to reflect information that is learned subsequent to an investment  decision.   The content of these \ndocuments was prepared for limited purposes, may not reflect accurate or current facts or the current views of \nany party to the proposed acquisition, and may include discussion that is not necessarily relevant to the federal or \nstate r egulatory processes.  \nThe information herein designated as trade secret has been designated as nonpublic and highly confidential in its \nentirety because it contains information GIP considers to be trade secret as defined by Minn.

Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b), and \nthe Protective Order issued on December 5, 2024, and Highly Confidential Trade Secret \n(“HCTS”) Data pursuant to the Protective Order for Highly Confidential Trade Secret \nData issued on December 16, 2024. \n  \nAs it relates to Trade Secret Information designation, the Partners are providing \nSchedule 1 and have taken reasonable efforts to keep Schedule 1 secret. It has not \nbeen provided to any individual outside of the Partners and the senior leadership of \nALLETE. Schedule 1 derives independent economic value from not being available to \nthe public. The terms included in Schedule 1 were negotiated by the Partners and, if \ndisclosed to competitors, would give competitors information about which terms the \nPartners found important to negotiate, and which terms they were willing to agree to. \nThe secrecy of the document provides independent economic value because disclosure \nto competitors would disadvantage the Partners in future negotiations in this and other \ntransactions. \n  \nHCTS Information includes “all information related to…commercial arrangements or \nagreements that may affect future negotiations or transactions of the disclosing party.” \nSchedule 1 contains information related to a commercial agreement. It was developed \nspecifically to delineate the terms of the commercial agreement between the Partners. \nSchedule 1 “may affect future negotiations or transactions” between the Partners in this \ntransaction, or between one or more of the Partners and third-parties in potential future \ntransactions because it identifies sensitive provisions that would be heavily negotiated \nin any future transaction of this nature. Disclosure of this information to competitors \nwould place the Partners at a significant disadvantage in the highly competitive private \nequity field. As such, Schedule 1 is HCTS Information under the Protective Order for \nHighly Confidential Trade Secret Data. \n  \nFinally, Schedule 1 is directly related to a document that the Administrative Law Judge \nhas already confirmed is HCTS Data. Order on Motion to Compel (Mar. 18, 2025). \n  \nAs a result, Schedule 1 is properly designated as HCTS in its entirety. Because the \ndocument is classified as HCTS in its entirety, the Partners provide the following \ndescription of the excised material as required by Minn. Rule 7829.0500, subp. 3: \n  \nNature of \nthe Material  Author  General Import  Document  Dates Prepared  \nPreliminary \nAgreement  GIP and \nCPP \nInvestments  The document is a \nhighly sensitive, \nconfidential, preliminary \ncommercial agreement \nbetween the Partners.

INTRODUCTION AND Q UALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ. Please state your name , employer, and position . 2 \nA. My name is Jennifer J. Cady, I am employed by ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power1 3 \nas Vice President of Regulatory and Legislative Affairs.   4 \n 5 \nQ. Did you provide Direct Testimony in this proceeding?  6 \nA. Yes. 7 \n 8 \nQ. Did you provide Rebuttal Testimony in this proceeding?  9 \nA. Yes. 10 \n 11 \nQ. What is the purpose of your Surrebuttal Testimony ? 12 \nA. I am providing Surrebuttal  Testimony to update the Minnesota Public Utilities 13 \nCommission (“Commission”) on the status of other relevant regulatory proceedings , as 14 \nwell as to respond to Rebuttal Testimony filed by the Laborers’ International Union of 15 \nNorth America (“LiUNA”).  16 \n 17 \nQ. Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding?  18 \nA. No. 19 \n 20 \nII. UPDATE ON OTHER REGULATED UTILITY PROCEEDINGS  21 \nQ. What other re gulatory  approvals are necessary for the Acquisition?  22 \nA. In addition to approval from this Commission , Minnesota Power n eeds to receive 23 \napprovals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and the Public 24 \nService Commission of Wisconsin (“ PSCW ”) to proceed with the Acquisition.   25 \n 26 \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Surrebuttal  Testimony and \nthe Petition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise \nspecifically defined, references to “ALLETE” indicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including \nMinnesota Power and all re gulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to \nALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n \n 2 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Surrebuttal  Q. Did the Commission request any information regarding these agency reviews?  1 \nA. Yes. Order Point 3(E) of the Commission’s referral Order requested the following: 2 \n“How do relevant and related dockets pending before the [FERC], [PSCW], and/or other 3 \nstate, federal or foreign government agencies impact the Commission’s consideration 4 \nof the [Acquisition] ?”2 5 \n 6 \nQ. Since your Rebuttal  Testimony was filed on March 4, 2025 , have there been 7 \ndevelopments in any of the other proceedings noted above?  8 \nA. Yes. On March 11, 2025, the Administrative Law Judge assembled the Record for 9 \nCommission Review in the PSCW proceeding on this matter. On March 13, 2025, the 10 \nPSCW orally approved the proposed Acquisition under all relevant provisions of the 11 \nWisconsin Utility Holding Company Act (Wis. Stat.  § 196.795), subject to certain 12 \nconditions outlined in the PSCW Staff’s Memorandum for Comment dated February 13 \n11, 2025. In light of the PSCW’s decision to approve the proposed Acquisition, the 14 \nPSCW took no action on Superior, Water, Light and Power Company’s requests for 15 \ndeclaratory rulings. The PSCW has directed the Division of Energy Regula tion and 16 \nAnalysis to draft a Final Decision consistent with its discussion at the March 13, 2025,  17 \nmeeting.  18 \n 19 \nAdditionally, o n January 31, 2025,  the Company submitted the Hart -Scott-Rondino 20 \n(“HSR”) Act premerger notification filing , which notifies the Federal Trade 21 \nCommission and Antitrust Division of the Justice Department of the proposed 22 \nAcquisition . The HSR Act establishes waiting periods that must elapse before such 23 \nacquisit ions may be consummated and  authorizes the enforcement agencies to stay those 24 \nperiods until companies provide certain additional information about the likelihood that 25 \nthe p roposed transaction would substantially  lessen  competition  in violation of Section 26 \n7 of the Clayton Act.  The 30-day waiting period expired on Wednesday, March 5, 2025, 27 \nwhich provided the merger clearance to close  under the HSR Act.  28 \n \n2 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canda Pension Plan Investment \nBoard and Global Infrastructure Partners , Docket No. E -015/PA-24-198, ORDER REQUIRING ADDITIONAL \nINFORMATION AND GRANTING INTERVENTION , AND NOTICE OF AND ORDER FOR HEARING  (Oct. 7, 2024).   \n \n 3 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Surrebuttal   1 \nQ. Can you provide a summary of all approvals received as of the date of this 2 \nsurrebuttal testimony?  3 \nA. Yes. On August 21, 2024, ALLETE’s shareholders voted to approve the proposed 4 \nAcquisition. Approximately 97 percent of shareholder votes cast were in favor of 5 \napproving the transaction. On December 19, 2024, the FERC issued an Or der in Docket 6 \nNo. EC24 -1-5-000 approving the Acquisition, stating “As discussed below, we 7 \nauthorize the Proposed Transaction as consistent with the public interest.”3 Next, on 8 \nMarch 5 , 2025, the waiting period under the Hart -Scott -Rondino Act expired, providing 9 \nthe Acquisition with clearance to close. Finally, as stated above, on March 13, 2025,  the 10 \nPSCW approved the proposed Acquisition in PSCW Docket No. 5820 -DR-100. The 11 \nonly remaining state or federal regulatory approval required to close this transaction is 12 \nthat of the Commission  in this docket.  13 \n 14 \nIII. RESPONSE TO REBUTTAL TESTIMONY  15 \nQ. Did any other Parties  besides the Company and the Partners submit rebuttal 16 \ntestimony in this docket?  17 \nA. Yes. Rebuttal testimony was provided on behalf of LiUNA Minnesota/North Dakota.  18 \n 19 \nQ. Can you summarize LiUNA’s Rebuttal Testimony?  20 \nA. Yes. LiUNA Witness Erin Bryant provided testimony related to how the proposed 21 \ntransaction would likely affect governance, including conflicts of interest and fiduciary 22 \nresponsibilities, as well as access to capital and the procurement of goods and services 23 \nby Minnesota Power. Specifically, Witness Bryant disagree d with Direct Testimony 24 \nfrom witnesses representing the Department of Commerce and the  Large Power 25 \nIntervenors  and described  why the transaction is likely to provide public benefits in the 26 \nform of more dependable financing tha n ALLETE could secure going as a stand -alone 27 \nentity. Witness Bryant also note d that “[t]his transaction, and private ownership or 28 \ninvestment, is not new, or unique to Minnesota and follows a broader trend across the 29 \n \n3 ALLETE, Inc. & Alloy Parent LLC, EC24 -105-000, FERC ¶ 2 (2024) . Available at   \nhttps://www.ferc.gov/media/e -14-ec24 -105-000 (last accessed Mar. 2, 2025).  \n \n 4 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Surrebuttal  US utility sector”4 as private investment in the sector has surged from 17 percent of total 1 \npower sector investment in 2016 to 24 percent in 2024.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Do you have a response to Witness Bryant’s testimony?  4 \nA. Yes. Minnesota Power agrees with Witness Bryant’s conclusion that the proposed 5 \nAcquisition is likely to provide public benefits in the form of more dependable financing 6 \nthan ALLETE could secure going forward on a stand -alone basis. We are also pleased 7 \nthat investors of the caliber and size of the Canada Pension Plan Investments Board and 8 \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners are investing in a Minnesota company  of ALLETE’s 9 \ncaliber , and thereby in our region and state of Minnesota. Further, the Company agrees 10 \nwith Witness Bryant’s conclusions that private equity ownership will not create distinct 11 \ngovernance risks for ALLETE or Minnesota Power.  Finally, Witness Bryant’s 12 \ntestimony acknowledg es the fact that ALLETE presents unique investment risks due to 13 \nMinnesota Power’s concentration of  a handful of large, trade -exposed customers  that 14 \nmay make investors “wary of significant new ALLETE equity and debt offerings.”5 15 \nThis unique risk is most recently demonstrated by the Marc h 20, 2025,  public 16 \nannouncement that one of Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers, Cleveland - 17 \nCliffs, will temporarily idle two mining operations in northern Minnesota: Hibbing 18 \nTaconite and Minorca Mine. This operational change will result in layoffs of over 600 19 \nsteelworkers on the Iron Range and immediate reduced revenue for Minnesota Power.6 20 \nWhile this change underscores the ongoing and unchanged risk of Minnesota Power, it 21 \nalso underscores the value of investors who do not immediately react in the way the 22 \npublic markets typically do.   23 \n 24 \nIV. CONCLUSION   25 \nQ. Does this complete your testimony?  26 \nA. Yes.  27 \n \n4 LIUNA Ex. __ (EB) at 6 (“Bryant Rebuttal”).  \n5 Bryant Rebuttal at 3.  \n6 More than 600 Iron Range steelworkers out of work as auto industry cuts orders because of tariffs .

INTRODUCTION AND Q UALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ. Please state your name , employer, and position . 2 \nA. My name is Jonathan Bram and I am a founding partner of Global Infrastructure 3 \nPartners, which is the trading name for Global Infrastructure Management, LLC along 4 \nwith related funds (collectively “GIP”).   5 \n 6 \nQ. Did you provide Direct Testimony in this proceeding?  7 \nA. Yes. 8 \n 9 \nQ. Did you provide Rebuttal Testimony in this proceeding?  10 \nA. Yes. 11 \n 12 \nQ. What is the purpose of your Surrebuttal Testimony ? 13 \nA. I am providing Surrebuttal  Testimony to update the Minnesota Public Utilities 14 \nCommission (“Commission”) on documentation between the Partners related to the 15 \ngovernance  of ALLETE after the Acquisition .   16 \n 17 \nQ. Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding?  18 \nA. Yes. I am sponsoring the following schedule to my Surrebuttal Testimony:  19 \n• MP Exhibit ___ (J B), Surrebuttal Schedule 1 – Governance Term Sheet  20 \n 21 \nII. UPDATE ON DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO GOVERNANCE  22 \nQ. Did you address the governance of ALL ETE in your prior testimony ? 23 \nA. Yes. I testified in my Direct Testimony and Rebuttal Testimony on the governance of 24 \nALLETE after the close of the Acquisition.  In my Rebuttal Testimony I explained that 25 \nthe Partners have a preliminary document that included non -binding substantive 26 \nprovisions regarding governance but had not reached full agreement on certain terms. I 27 \nalso explained that through a cooperative process with ALLETE, and after hearing the 28 \nconcerns of DOC, OAG, and others, the Partners reached further agreement on the 29 \ngovernance of ALLETE, the details of which were explained in my Rebuttal Testimony 30 \n \n 2 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nBram  Rebuttal and Schedule  \n and the Rebuttal Testimony of CPP Investments Witness Alley . I further explained that, 1 \nas a result , certain of the governance provisions in that preliminary agreement are no 2 \nlonger applicable and that the Partners were working on a replacement document that 3 \nwill set forth these governance details and supersede the preliminary document terms 4 \npreviously provided.  5 \n 6 \nQ. Since your Rebuttal  Testimony was filed on March 4, 2025 , have there been any 7 \nchanges to how the Partners intend to govern ALLETE  after the Acquisition ? 8 \nA. No.  The Partners still intend to govern ALLETE in the manner described in my Rebuttal 9 \nTestimony and in the Rebuttal Testimony of Witness Alley .  10 \n 11 \nQ. What changes since your Rebuttal Testimony are you addressing in this 12 \nSurrebuttal Testimony?  13 \nA. As I previewed in my Rebuttal Testimony, the Partners have reached agreement on 14 \ngovernance provisions that replace in their entirety the governance -related provisions 15 \nof the prior preliminary document to effectuate the governance commitments described 16 \nby the Partners in the rebuttal testimony. The document attached as [MP Exhibit ___ 17 \n(JB), Surrebuttal Schedule 1] reflects those up dated governance -related provisions . This 18 \ndocument contains highly confidential trade secret information of the Partners that, if 19 \ndisclosed, would affect the Partners’ future negotiations and transactions.  20 \n 21 \nIII. CONCLUSION   22 \nQ. Does this complete your testimony?  23 \nA. Yes.  24 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  – NOT  PUBLIC DATA HAS  BEEN EXCISED  \nTRADE  SECRET  DAT A EXCISED IN ITS  ENTIRETY  \n \n \n \nMP EXHIBIT ___ (JB), SURREBUTTAL SCHEDULE 1  \n  \n \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198   \nBram Surrebuttal and Schedule  \nMP Exhibit __ (JB), Surrebuttal Schedule 1"

INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS  1 \n2 \nQ. Please state your name, affiliation, and address. 3 \nA. My name is Will T. Keyes, and my business address is 2002 London Road, Suite 105, Duluth, 4 \nMinnesota 55812.  5 \n6 \nQ. By whom are you employed and in what capacity? 7 \nA. I am employed by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 31. I currently 8 \nserve as the Business Manager and Financial Secretary.  9 \n10 \nQ. Did you previously provide Direct Testimony in this proceeding? 11 \nA. Yes. I submitted Direct Testimony on behalf of IBEW Local 31 addressing the concerns and 12 \npotential impacts of the proposed acquisition of ALLETE, Inc. by Canada Pension Plan Investment 13 \nBoard (CPP Investments) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), speciﬁcally as they relate to the 14 \nemployees we represent at Minnesota Power.  15 \n16 \nQ. What is the purpose of your Surrebuttal Testimony? 17 \nA. The purpose of this surrebuttal testimony is to update the record following the ratiﬁcation of a 18 \ncontract extension agreement by Local 31’s membership and to respond to issues raised in the 19 \nrebuttal testimony of Company Witness Laura E. Krollman regarding employee protections, 20 \nworkforce security, and post- acquisition expectations.  21 \n22 \nII. CONTRACT EXTENSION AGREEMENT AND UNION POSITION 23 \n24 \nQ. Has the tentative agreement referenced in the Company’s rebuttal testimony been ratiﬁed 25 \nby the membership of IBEW Local 31?  26 \nA. Yes. On March 18, 2025 , the members of IBEW Local 31 voted to ratify a two -year extension of 27 \nour collective bargaining agreement with Minnesota Power. The agreement now extends through 28 \nApril 30, 2028.  29 \n30 \nTestimony of Will Keyes Business Manager /Financial Secretary , International Brotherhood \nof Electrical Workers Local 31  \n \n2 \n Q. How does the term of this agreement relate to the Company’s two -year employee 1 \ncommitment?  2 \nA. The contract extension extends beyond the two -year post- acquisition employee commitment 3 \noutlined in the Petition. While the Company’s commitment to job protections begins at the close of 4 \nthe acquisition and lasts for two years, our agreement secures wages, beneﬁts, and other terms 5 \nand conditions of employment through at least April 30, 2028 — offering additional stability and 6 \nprotection for our members.  7 \n 8 \nQ. What are the key provisions of the ratiﬁed agreement?  9 \nA. The agreement includes:  10 \n• Extension of the CBA through April 30, 2028.  11 \n• General wage increases of 4.25% effective January 1, 2026, and 4% effective January 1, 12 \n2027.  13 \n• A commitment to maintain the same jobs in the same location for two years following the 14 \nclosing of the acquisition.  15 \n• A process to evaluate market competitiveness of classiﬁcations with potential wage 16 \nadjustments.  17 \n• A neutrality framework supporting the right of non- union employees to seek representation 18 \nby Local 31.  19 \nAll current beneﬁts — including the deﬁned beneﬁt pension, 401(k), long -term disability, and life 20 \ninsurance — will remain in effect throughout the contract term.  21 \n 22 \nQ. Has Local 31 taken a formal position on the acquisition?  23 \nA. Yes. With the agreement now ratiﬁed and key protections in place, Local 31 leadership has 24 \ncommitted to supporting the acquisition during the regulatory review process.  25 \n 26 \nIII. RESPONSE TO COMPANY TESTIMONY AND OUTLOOK  27 \n 28 \nQ. How do you respond to Ms. Krollman’s statements regarding employee protections?  29 \nA. I appreciate the Company’s recognition of the concerns initially raised by Local 31 and its 30 \nwillingness to work with us to establish additional assurances for our members. The inclusion of 31 \nTestimony of Will Keyes Business Manager /Financial Secretary , International Brotherhood \nof Electrical Workers Local 31  \n \n3 \n comparable job protections for bargaining unit employees reﬂects meaningful progress and 1 \ndemonstrates responsiveness to those concerns.  2 \n 3 \nQ. What is your outlook going forward?  4 \nA. Our outlook is cautiously optimistic. The agreement we’ve reached offers our members short - 5 \nterm stability and reﬂects the type of productive labor -management relationship we’ve worked hard 6 \nto build. With the acquiring partners now formally entering the picture, we expect to maintain a 7 \nsimilarly collaborative working relationship that values the contributions of union- represented 8 \nemployees and supports the long -term health of the utility.  9 \n 10 \nQ. Are there still any outstanding concerns?  11 \nA. Yes. While we acknowledge the important legal and contractual safeguards around beneﬁts and 12 \nfunding described in the Company’s testimony, we remain mindful of the evolving nature of the 13 \nutility industry and the long -term intentions of private investors. These concerns include:  14 \n• The potential for future restructuring or asset transfers outside the scope of our agreement.  15 \n• Uncertainty about whether new facilities — especially those developed under unregulated 16 \nsubsidiaries — will be staffed by union labor.  17 \n• The impact of post- 2028 decisions on workforce continuity and beneﬁt sustainability.  18 \nOur support for the transaction is grounded in the protections gained and the strength of our 19 \ncurrent agreement. That support will continue to be accompanied by close oversight, active 20 \nengagement, and preparedness for future bargaining.  21 \n 22 \nIV.  CONCLUSION  23 \n 24 \nQ. What is your ﬁnal assessment?  25 \nA. Local 31 appreciates the steps taken by Minnesota Power and the acquiring partners to address 26 \nemployee concerns, and we are encouraged by the progress made. With the ratiﬁed extension in 27 \nplace, our union is supporting the acquisition. We view this as a positive step forward and look 28 \nforward to working with all parties involved to ensure the continued success of the Company and 29 \nthe stability of our members' employment and beneﬁts.  30 \n 31 \nTestimony of Will Keyes Business Manager /Financial Secretary , International Brotherhood \nof Electrical Workers Local 31  \n \n4 \n Q. Does this complete your surrebuttal testimony?  1 \nA. Yes.  2"

Learn why this is important\nDear Commission Members:\nI am writing to urge the Commission to reject the proposed acquisition of Minnesota\nPower by BlackRock, as outlined in Docket E-015/PA-24-198. \nThe purpose of private equity ownership is to maximize returns to shareholders, not to\nprovide long-term, affordable, and reliable utility service. This business model isfundamentally at odds with the public service mission of a regulated electric utility.\nWhen private equity firms or institutional investors like BlackRock take over critical\ninfrastructure, the results have consistently been harmful to ratepayers and the publicinterest. A few recent examples illustrate this:\nPuerto Rico’s electric grid was handed over to LUMA Energy, a private entity partlybacked by private equity. Since the transition, residents have experienced worseningreliability, increased outages, and rising rates, along with a lack of transparency andaccountability. Public backlash has been significant, including protests over serviceconditions.\nIn the United Kingdom, decades of utility privatization, especially in electricity, water,and rail, have led to higher consumer prices, outsized investor returns, andunderinvestment in infrastructure, prompting widespread calls for re-nationalization.The privatized model has put profits ahead of public welfare, often leaving consumersto bear the cost of poor service and infrastructure failure.\nCloser to home, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, residents experienced sharp rateincreases following the purchase of the region’s utility infrastructure by privateinvestors. As profits were funneled to shareholders, local control vanished andaffordability suffered. That experience serves as a stark warning to Minnesotans aboutthe risks of investor-driven utility ownership.\nThese are not isolated incidents. They are part of a pattern: when private equity or largeinvestment firms take control of utilities, \ncosts rise, service often declines, and public input is\nsidelined. Minnesota Power is an essential part of the state’s infrastructure and economy,\nespecially in northern communities. Turning its future over to a global investment firm\naccountable only to its shareholders is not in the best interests of Minnesota consumers.\nI urge the Commission to reject this acquisition in order to preserve the accountability,\ntransparency, and public-centered mission of utility service in our state.\nSincerely,\nScott A. Buchanan\n231 E. Arrowhead RoadDuluth, MN 55803scott.buchanan@outlook.com"

McKenzie.  \nOn February 13, 2025, the Minnesota  Department of Commerce  (Department ) filed \na Motion to Compel Discovery and to lift Highly Confidential Trade Secret ( HCTS ) \nDesignations  (Motion) .1 The Department alleges that the Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board and Global  Infrastructure Partners (CPP -GIP) have improperly \nredacted Investment Committee Memos  (IC Memos)  and have improperly marked a \ndocument ( SLV-D-6)2 as containing HCTS information. The Large Power Intervenors \n(LPI) and Office of the Attorney General -Residential Utilities Division ( OAG RUD) filed \nresponses supporting the Department’s M otion.3 CPP- GIP filed its response on \nFebruary  28, 2025, arguing that the redactions and HCTS designation are proper.4  \n \nOn March 11, 2025, the Administrative Law Judge ordered CPP- GIP to submit \nunredacted copies of the disputed IC Memos for in- camera review.  CPP- GIP submitted \nthe required documents on March 12, 2025.  The record regarding the Motion closed on \nthat date.  \n  \n \n1 eDocket No. 20252-215370-01 . \n2 This document is also known as “DOC IR SUPP 0011.01 Attach” and is attached to the unredacted Direct \nTestimony of Stephanie Vavro, (February 4, 2025) (eDockets No. 20252-214942-02 ). \n3 Response in Support of Motion to Compel (Feb. 27, 2025) (eDockets No. 20252-215830-02 ); Response \nin Support of DOC Motion to Compel Discovery and Lift HCTS Designations  (Feb. 28, 2025)(eDockets No.  \n20252-215888-02). \n \n4 Opposition to Motion to Compel Discovery and Lift HCTS Designation (March 3, 2025) (eDockets No.  \n20252-215940-01 ).  \n \n[217918/1 ] 2 \n \nBased upon all of the files, records and proceedings herein, and for the reasons \nexplained in the accompanying Memorandum, the Administrative Law Judge makes the \nfollowing:  \nORDER  \n1. The Department’s Motion  for production of unredacted documents is \nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. CPP- GIP must produce copies of the \nfollowing disputed documents in unredacted form except as to the specific redactions \nauthorized below:  \na. DOC IR 0013.02: redactions 1 and 2 on page 5; redactions 2 and 3 on page 51; redactions 1 and 2 on page 52, and redactions 1, 2, and \n3 on page 53. All other redactions are disallowed.  \nb. DOC IR 0060.01 Supp 2: redaction on page 40 and redaction on page 44, CPP- GIP may also redact page 49, bullet 5 after the phrase \n“…under Minnesota law…” All other redactions are disallowed.  \nc. DOC IR 0060.02 Supp 2: must be produced without redactions . \nd. DOC IR 0060.03 Supp 2: must be produced without redactions . \n2. The Department’s request  to remove the HCTS  designation of SLV- D-6/ \nAttachment 11.01 is DENIED  WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  \nDated: March 18, 2025  \n \n \nMEGAN J. McKENZIE  \nAdministrative  Law Judge  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM  \n \nI. The IC Memos  Were Improperly Redacted.  \nCPP- GIP redacted portions of four IC Memos  based on Canadian data- privacy \nlaw, the attorney work product doctrine,  and the attorney -client privilege . \nA. Canadian Law Does Not Provide a Basis for Redactions.  \nAs an initial matter, all redactions based on Canadian law are improper. The \nCanadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act has no \napplicability in a contested case proceeding pending before this tribunal and the \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission under Minnesota law.  Furthermore, the Judge has \n[217918/1 ] 3 \n issued a protective order allowing disclosure of dat a covered by applicable law , such as \nthe Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.5 Sufficient protections for data of concern \nin the IC Memos is already in place.  \nB. The IC  Memos are not Attorney Work Product.  \nCPP- GIP makes conclusory assertion s that the redactions were proper ly made  \nbased on the attorney work product doctrine. To be protected by this  doctrine, material \nmust contain opinions, conclusions, legal theories, or mental impressions of counsel, and \nit must have been prepared in anticipation of litigation.6 Whether documents were \nprepared in anticipation of litigation is a factual determinat ion.7 The question is whether, \nin light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case, the \ndocument can fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect \nof litigation.8 CPP- GIP’s declaration states that the IC Memos  were “prepared to provide \na recommendation to the investment committee of CPP Investments as to whether to \npursue a particular investment .”9 CPP-GIP has not shown that the IC Memos  were \nprepared in anticipation of litigation. The IC Memos are not protected by the work product doctrine.   \nC.  The Attorney -Client Privilege P rotects Some of the R edacted Material.  \nCPP- GIP claims that the disputed redactions contain legal advice and analysis.  \n“The purpose behind the attorney -client privilege is to promote open and honest \ndiscussion between clients and their attorneys.”\n10 Because “the attorney -client privilege \nis a barrier to disclosure and tends to suppress relevant facts,” the privilege  is strictly \nconstrued.11 The party asserting the privilege has the burden of establishing that the \nsought -after information is immune from discovery .12  \nThe attorney -client privilege protects legal advice, it does not protect ordinary \nbusiness advice.13 Under the predominant purpose test, the attorney -client privilege \napplies to the entirety of a document only if the predominant purpose of the \ncommunication is to render or solicit legal advice.14 However, “ even when the \npredominant purpose of the communication is business advice, the attorney -client \nprivilege will protect any portions of the document that contain legal advice. ”15 Legal \n \n5 Minn. Stat. Ch. 13 (2024)  \n6 City Pages v. State , 655 N.W.2d 839, 846 (Minn. Ct. App. 2003) . \n7 Id.  \n8 Id.   \n9 Declaration of Kathryn Esaw  (date) (docket no?).  \n10 Leer v. Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. Ry ., 308 N.W.2d 305, 309 (Minn. 1981).    \n11 Id.   \n12 In re Cragg, 998 N.W.2d 294, 304 (Minn. Ct. App. 2023).  \n13 In re Polaris, Inc ., 967 N.W.2d 397, 407 (Minn. 2021) . \n14 Id.   \n15 Id.   \n[217918/1 ] 4 \n advice does not include public relations advice, or legal advice which is merely incidental \nto business advice.16  \nCPP- GIP did not meet its burden to prove the privilege as to all redactions. An in-\ncamera review of the disputed redactions shows  that many redactions concern business \nstrategy, rather than legal advice. The redactions that contain truly legal advice have been noted in the Order  above and are permitted, the remainder are improper and the \ninformation must be produced. The documents remain subject to the protective orders in this case and should be produced accordingly.  \nII. The HCTS Designation of  SLV D -6/ Attachment 11.01 is Proper.  \nUnder Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b), data provided to the state is trade secret \ninformation when three factors are satisfied: 1) it was supplied by the affected organization; 2) it was the subject of efforts by the organization that are reasonable under \nthe circumstances to maintain its secrec y; and 3) it derives independent economic value, \nactual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its di sclosure or \nuse. \nThe parties in this case stipulated to the entry of a HCTS protective order.  Under \nthe HCTS protective order, data that meets one of the following classifications may be designated as HCTS data:  \n(a) commercial arrangements or agreements that may affect future \nnegotiations or transactions of the disclosing party;  \n \n(b) commercially sensitive investment, financing, or forward looking business \nplans, analysis, and/or models by or for a disclosing party;  \n(c) commercially sensitive data related to specific customers or customer groups; or  \n(d)  commercially sensitive proprietary information of entities other than the disclosing party.  \n CPP- GIP provided evidence that it has engaged in significant efforts to maintain \nthe secrecy of SLV D -6/ Attachment 11.01 and that the information at issue is \ncommercially valuable. The current record also shows that SLV D -6/ Attachment 11.01 is \na not a final contract or final corporate governance document . Instead, it is a terms sheet \nthat is still subject to  negotiation and change.  Its designation as HCTS data is currently \nproper.  \nSLV D -6/ Attachment 11.01 is highly relevant to this proceeding and the HCTS \ndesignation does not prevent the document from being used and considered by the \n \n16 Id; In re Cragg, 998 N.W.2d 294, 307 (Minn. Ct. App. 2023).  \n[217918/1 ] 5 \n Commission .  While the general public will not have access to the document, various \nintervenors representing ratepayers, the unions, and other constituencies do have \naccess. It is not necessary to remove the designation in order to allow the development \nof a full record for the Commission’s consideration.

C. \n10 Scholtz Decl. ¶ 7.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –  TRADE SECRET DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n3 \n Protective Order’s definition of “protected data.”11  The Protective Order defines protected data \nas either (1) protected data within the meaning of Minn. R. 7829.0100, subp. 19a; or (2) \n“security information,” “trade secret information,” or “not public data” within the meaning of \nMinn. Stat. §§ 13.02, subd. 8a, 13.37, subd. 1(a), (b) , provisions of the Minnesota Data Practices \nAct (the Act) .12   \nIn general, t he Act provides that “[a]ll government data collected, created, received, \nmaintained or disseminated by a government entity shall be public  unless classified by statute . . \n. as nonpublic or protected nonpublic.”13  The presumption that government data is public \nreflects “a fundamental commitment to making the operations of our public institutions open to the public.”\n14  As a result, the courts construe the Act in favor of public access to information \nheld by government agencies.15 \nTrade secret data are a type of “nonpublic data” that are exempt from the Act’s public-\ndisclosure requirement.16  “Trade secret data” means “government data . . . (1) that was supplied \nby the affected individual or organization, (2) that is the subject of efforts by the individual or organization that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy, and (3) that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.”\n17 \n \n11 Protective Order ¶  1.  \n12 Id. \n13 Minn. Stat. § 13.03, subd. 1 (emphasis added).  \n14 Prairie Island Indian Cmty. v. Minn. Dep’t of Pub. Safety , 658 N.W.2d 876, 884 (Minn. Ct. \nApp. 2003) . \n15 Id. \n16 Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 2(a).  \n17 Id., subd. 1(b) ; accord Protective Order and Protective Order for Trade Secret Data at 2. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –  TRADE SECRET DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n4 \n ALLETE’s response to Sierra Club IR No. 26 claims without explanation that SIERRA \nIR 0026.02 Attach TS “derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being \ngenerally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who \ncan obtain value from its disclosure or use.”18  But merely reciting the statutory definition cannot \nsupport ALLETE’s claim that its projections of customer rate impacts are trade secret.19  On the \ncontrary, cursory review of SIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS and ALLETE’s description of the \nattachment in response to OAG IR No. 42 strongly suggests that it is not entitled to trade -secret \nprotection. \nSIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS contains projections of Minnesota Power’s future rate \nincreases broken down by customer class.20  Data about pricing for individual, large customers \nmay have independent economic value to a utility if there is a risk that those customers could be poached by providers of alternative fuels.\n21  In general, however, Minnesota Power’s ratepayers \nare captive and have no alternatives.22  As a result, there appears to be little if any competitive \nadvantage for ALLETE of maintaining the secrecy of these projected rate increases.   \nIt is hard to fathom what a competitor of ALLETE, if one exists, would do with the rate -\nincrease information in SIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS.  ALLETE itself characterizes the \ninformation as a “high- level point in time” forecast that may or may not come to pass, in part \nbecause “Minnesota Power will remain fully regulated by the Commission, and any \n \n18 Scholtz Decl., Ex.

B. \n21 See, e.g., N. States Power Co. v. N.D. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 502 N.W.2d 240, 243 (N.D. 1993) \n(affirming that price and sales -volume data  contained in negotiated contracts between utility and \ncertain large customers  “derives independent economic value from not being generally known to \nand not being readily ascertainable by proper means by providers of alternative fuel ”). \n22 MPUC Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198, Lebens Direct  at 3 (Feb. 4, 2025).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT –  TRADE SECRET DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n5 \n authorizations of future rate changes through base rates or cost recovery riders will remain \nsubject to the Commission’s jurisdiction.”23  ALLETE insists that it “is not assuming that it will \nincrease rates by any particular amount” over the 2023–2032 time period depicted in SIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS.\n24  Having qualified its projections to such a degree, ALLETE cannot \ncredibly claim that they hold value to its competitors.  \nFinally, ALLETE has asserted that SIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS is a “nonpublic \nmodel,”25 implying that it contains proprietary assumptions.  But ALLETE has not demonstrated \nthat a competitor could derive economic value from any of the assumptions used in SIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS.  The attachment reflects assumptions about the overall rate increase \nMinnesota Power ratepayers will experience by 2032, as well as each class’s base revenue and annual sales volume over that period.\n26  If ALLETE believes that assumptions in SIERRA IR \n0026.02 Attach TS are trade secret, ALLETE must  explain why each assumption it wishes not to \ndisclose derives economic value from not being disclosed.  And even if ALLETE can make this showing, the proper course of action would be targeted redaction only of the trade -secret \nassumptions, rather than of the entire document as ALLETE has done.\n27 \nCONCLUSION \nSIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS does not meet the definition of “trade secret” under the \nAct, and therefore does not meet the definition of “protected data” in the Protective Order.

Please note, these \nmodels utilized projections, ranges of understanding, and scenario plann ing based on \ninformation available at  the time and may not reflect accurate or current facts or the \ncurrent\n views of any party to the proposed Acquisition.\nc.No, the Company has not estimated monthly bill impacts for an average residential  \ncustomer  for each year. Instead, the Company estimated future customer rates annually  \non a $/MWh basis (see subpart (b), above).\nSIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS includes trade secret information as defined by Minn. \nStat.\n § 13.37, subd. 1(b).  This information derives independent economic value, actual or \npotential, from not b eing generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by \nproper m eans by, other persons who can obtain value from its disclosure or use. Thus, the \nCompany has made reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. Because the Company has \ncl\nassified the entire document as trade secret information, the Company  provides the \nfollowing description of the excised material as required by Minn.

The spreadsheet assumed increases proportional to each class’s base revenue as a high -\nlevel modeling assumption. This does not constitute the Company’s plan for future filing s \nor expectation of future revenue apportionment, which will be determined by the \nCommission in future rate proceedings.  \n \n4. The Company does not expect the assumptions in the spreadsheet to be “accurate” over this time period. As discussed above, this is a high-level modeling exercise of potential \nrevenue requirements based on a set of assumptions at a point in time. The actual  level of \nrequired revenue will change based on a multitude of factors over this time period, which the Company cannot speculate on. Mathematically, the  spreadsheet  [TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION BEGINS   \n TRADE SECRET INF\n ORMATION ENDS]  but Minnesota Power does \nnot anticipate any particular level of residential rate increases over the 2023 -2032 period \nnor does it expect any individual rate changes (which typically do not happen on an annual \nbasis) to be the same for each rate proceeding.  \n \nB. \n1. Minnesota Power is not assuming that it will increase rates by any particular amount over \nthe 2023-2032 time period . As discussed above, this is a high-level modeling exercise of \npotential revenue requirements based on a set of assumptions at a point in time.  Any future \nrate changes will remain fully subject to Commission approval.  \n \n2. This is based on the level of revenue increases that would be required to meet the revenue requirements from the forward-looking assumptions in CUB IR 0077.01 Attach TS.  \n \n3. Due to the high-level nature of the forecast, the Company does not have an accurate \nbreakout of future amounts by recovery method. As described in subpart B.2, this is a high-\nlevel forecast of the future revenue requirements.  The model did not contemplate  specific \ntiming of rate case or cost recovery rider fillings with any level of specificity.  \n \n4. The amounts in the spreadsheet are inclusive of all revenue requirements.  \n \n5. See subpart B.4. For the reasons noted throughout this response, the capital costs were simply based on the authorized ROE and capital structure in place at the time of \npreparation.  The embedded cost of debt fluctuated based on assumed debt maturities and \nissuances , ranging from the currently authorized cost of debt of 4.4% to 5.1% over the \nforecast period.    \n \n6.

See SIERRA IR 0058 (c). While the A cquisition does not directly impact customer rates, \nif the Acquisition does not close the Company will be in a challenging position and will \nface material risk in accessing the amount of capital needed to serve customers, as well as the potential increases  in costs of capital for customers as compared to the past when the \nCompany did not require the same quantities of capital. This could lead to increased costs in either or both of the cost of capital and the costs of dela ys in projects, as well as the \ninability to execute projects in a timely manner to meet State carbon free goals.  As such, the Acquisition presents rate -related benefits in the form of avoided risk and the potential \nto avoid rate increases that may be required if the Company must rely on the public market to obtain equity financing . Further, maintaining the financial health and capability \nof the Company to access capital through the Acquisition avoids these negative outcomes and allows the Commission (rathe r than the limitations of the public markets as applied to \nALLETE) to determine whether Minnesota Power can move forward with proposed \nprojects and initiatives consistent with S tate policy goals and the public interest. The \nCompany believes keeping this authority in the hands of the Commission is a rate -related \nbenefit to customers.  \nThe information designated as trade secret herein is financial information and is designated as \nsuch because this information is not generally known to and not readily ascertainable by investors and competitors of the Company who could obtain economic value from its \ndisclosure.  Thus, this information is tra de secret information as defined by Minn.

I also offer to meet and confer with ALLETE regarding this request to remove trade- secret designations.  \nS\nierra Club IR No. 26 requested, among other things, “the estimated annual revenue \nrequirement” and the “monthly bill  impacts for an average residential customer” associated with \nMinnesota Power’s forecasted capital expenditures.1  In response, ALLETE provided, as \nAttachment 26.02, an Excel spreadsheet with “detail on the portion of [ALLETE’s]  estimated \nrevenue requirements that are anticipated to be collected from Minnesota Power customers ” in \n2023–2032.2   \nA\nLLETE provided its response to Sierra Club IR No. 26 to the OAG.  The OAG then sent \nALLETE an information request, OAG IR No. 42, to better understand Attachment 26.02.  In its \nresponse , ALLETE describes the calculations  performed  in Attachment 26.02.  Despite asserting \nthat Attachment 26.02 is “a nonpublic model” in its entirety, ALLETE  designat es only 12 words \nof its response to OAG IR No. 42 as trade secret .3   \nT\nhe OAG marked its questions  in IR No. 42 as nonpublic to avoid inadvertently violating  \nthe protective order in this case.

The Act provides that “ [a]ll government data \ncollected, created, received, maintained or disseminated by a government entity shall be public  \nunless classified by statute  . . . as nonpublic or protected nonpublic .”5  The presumption that \ngovernment data is public reflects “a fundamental commitment to making the operations of our public institutions open to the public.”\n6  As a result , the courts construe the Act in favor of public \naccess  to information held by government agencies.7 \nT\nrade secret data are a type of “nonpublic data” that are exempt from the Act’s public -\ndisclosure requirement.8  “Trade secret data” means  “government data . . . (1) that was supplied \nby the affected individual or organization, (2) that is the subject of efforts by the individual or organization that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy, and (3) that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.”\n9 \nA\nLLETE’s response to Sierra Club IR No. 26 claims without explanation that Attachment \n26.02 “derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain value from its disclosure or use.”\n10  But m erely reciting the statutory definition  cannot support \nALLETE’s claim that its projections of customer rate impacts are trade secret.11  On the contrary, \ncursory review of Attachment 26.02 and ALLETE’s description of the attachment in response to OAG IR No. 42 strongly suggests that it is not entitled to trade-secret protection. \nA\nttachment 26.02 contains projections of Minnesota Power’s future rate increases broken \ndown by customer class.  Data about pricing for individual, large customers may have independent economic value to a utility if there is a risk that th ose customers could be poached by providers of \nalternative fuels.\n12  In general, however, Minnesota Power ’s ratepayers are captive and have no \nalternatives.13  As a result, there appears  to be little if any competitive advantage  for ALLETE  of \nmaintaining the secrecy of these projected rate increases.   \nIt\n is hard  to fathom what a competitor of ALLETE, if one exists, would do with the rate-\nincrease information in Attachment 26.02.

But ALLETE has not demonstrated that a competitor \ncould derive economic value from any of the assumptions used in Attachment 26.02.  The attachment reflects assumptions about the overall rate increase Minnesota Power ratepayers will experience by 2032, as well as each class’s base revenue and annual sales volume over that period.\n17  If ALLETE believes that  assumptions in Attachment 26.02 are trade secret, ALLETE \nneeds to explain why each assumption it wishes not to disclose derives economic value from not \nbeing disclosed.  And  even  if ALLETE can make this showing, the proper course of action would \nbe targeted redaction only of the trade -secret assumptions, rather than of the entire document as \nALLETE has done .18 \nT\nhe public has an interest in understanding the potential rate impacts of ALLETE’s capital -\nspending plans.  If ALLETE will not voluntarily agree to remove the trade -secret designation s \nfrom Attachment 26.02 and the response to OAG IR No. 42, the OAG will be forced to seek relief \nfrom the ALJ under the terms of the protective order.
