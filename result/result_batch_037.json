The 9 \nPartners also provide Direct Testimony and further detail on the ownership of Alloy 10 \nParent.  11 \n 12 \nB. Description of the Acquisition  13 \nQ. Please describe the nature of the proposed Acquisition.  14 \nA. Today, ALLETE is a publicly traded investor -owned utility, meaning ownership of the 15 \nCompany and its assets is distributed among many investo rs who own shares of stock 16 \nin ALLETE. Shareholders are able to  purchase and sell company stock in the public 17 \nmarket at any time. Shareholders invest in the Company by purchasing stock  and expect 18 \na return, or profit, on their investment.  This profit is received through a combination of 19 \nan increasing  value in their purchased stock and from receipt of a dividend, or payment , 20 \nmade to shareholders based on the Company’s profit.  Through this proposed 21 \nAcquisition, ALLETE will remain an investor -owned utility but will be privately held 22 \nby two investors rather than many shareholders  investing through the publicly traded 23 \nstock market. Minnesota Power  will also remain a public utility ,3 and the Commission’s 24 \njurisdiction over the Minnesota Power utility remains unchanged by this Acquis ition.  25 \n 26 \n \n3 At a high level, Minn. Stat. § 216B.02, subd. 4 defines a public utility as “ persons, corporations, or other legal \nentities, their lessees, trustees, and receivers, now or hereafter operating, maintaining, or controlling in this state \nequipment or facilities for furnishing at retail natural, manufactured, or mixed gas or electric s ervice to or for the \npublic or engaged in the production and retail sale thereof  . . . .”   \n \n 6 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  Q. Why does a public utility need investors?  1 \nA.  Public utilities provide essential services needed by every individual, business, and 2 \ninstitution in society, and have a responsibility to ensure services are available and 3 \nreliable . Given the nature of the business of generating and distributing electricity to 4 \ncustomers , utilities require a significant amount of infrastructure and are therefore 5 \ncapital -intensive. Accordingly, utilities require steady funding to finance upgrades and 6 \nmodernization of  aging infrastructure, build  out of  new infrastructure , and operat ion of 7 \nthe business . Electric utilities raise capital through debt and equity (money invested by 8 \nshareholders) to fund investments in infrastructure, like transmission lines or renewable 9 \nenergy projects. Once  a project is  operational, the utility requests rate recovery of those 10 \napproved costs from customers through mechanisms like a general rate case or cost 11 \nrecovery rider. Ther efore, investors are essential to provide the up -front capital needed 12 \nto operate  the utility prior to customers paying for projects after rate recovery is 13 \napproved by the regulator. Funding capital -intensive infrastructure projects in this way 14 \n– through investors who provide up -front capital to fund project development and 15 \ndelivery – allows utilities to recover  costs from  customers  over a longer period of time , 16 \nmitigating the rate impact of large investments.   17 \n 18 \nQ.  What will change  as a result of this Acquisition?  19 \nA.  As a result of the Acquisition, Minnesota Power will have secured reliable access to the 20 \nequity capital required to fund the investments needed for the clean energy transition. 21 \nMinnesota Power will also have equity investors who are directly aligned with the 22 \nCompany’s strategy and invested for the long term, as contrasted to the public markets  23 \nwhich are driven by quarter -to-quarter results . The Acquisition will not result in 24 \nnegative impacts for customers or on Minnesota Power’s ability to provide safe and 25 \nreliable service. As discussed by Company Witness Scissons and Partner Witness es 26 \nAlley and  Bram, c ertain investor relations and governance structures  will change after 27 \nthe Acquisition has closed.  28 \n 29 \nQ. What will not change as a result of this Acquisition?  30 \n \n 7 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  A. As stated above, Minnesota Power will continue to be an investor -owned  public utility, 1 \nfully regulated by the Commission. Minnesota Power will remain headquartered in 2 \nDuluth, Minnesota  and locally managed  by its current leadership . All existing collective 3 \nbargaining agreements and union contracts will remain in place.  Minnesota Power’s 4 \nobligation to provide electric service to customers and to ensure that service is safe, 5 \nreliable, affordable and meets all state and federal regulations and policies remain 6 \nunchanged. Finally, Minnesota Power’s values, including integrity, community 7 \nengagement , and customer focus, also remain unchanged as these values are shared by 8 \nthe Partners.  9 \n 10 \nC. Goals and Benefits of the Acquisition  11 \nQ. What is the overall goal of this Acquisition?  12 \nA.  ALLETE is a diversified energy company; however, relative to its peers, ALLETE is 13 \nthe largest investor in renewable energy of all publicly traded utilities in the United 14 \nStates relative to market capitalization. ALLETE remains  a relatively small company 15 \ncompeting for  increasing amounts of  capital in a demanding market. The primary goal 16 \nof transitioning to a private company is to enable Minnesota Power to obtain a reliable 17 \nsource for the significant  additional equity capital it needs to continue and expand its 18 \ninvestment in clean energy technology and systems, including changing transmission 19 \nand generation needs, while continuing  its commitment to provide safe, reliable , and 20 \naffordable energy to its customers.  Transitioning ALLETE to a privately held  company 21 \nwould mitigate the risk of volatility associated with seeking significant financing in the 22 \npublic markets  and would result in long-term investor alignment with the Company’s 23 \ncurrent strategies , values, and commitment to its communities and the clean energy 24 \ntransition . Like other investors, private investors seek a reasonable return on their 25 \ninvestments and a reasonable opportunity to earn that return. However, as described in 26 \nmore detail by Company Witness  Taran and Partner Witnesses Alley and Bram , unlike 27 \nthe public markets , private investors have an ability to exercise more patience with 28 \nrespect to quarterly earnings and dividends , and the cyclical ups and downs of the 29 \nmarket,  due to a focus on long -term investment  strategies , and may be  particularly 30 \n \n 8 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  beneficial during times of rising costs  and higher inflation  when utility stocks tend to be  1 \nless favorable among stock market investors . 2 \n 3 \nQ. Why did ALLETE cho ose the Partners ? 4 \nA. The ALLETE  Board of Directors  made its own decision to seek out private 5 \ninfrastructure investors, particularly those with experience in the energy  industry , and 6 \nchose CPP Investments and GIP specifically. It was of utmost importance to the 7 \nCompany to choose  investors who were aligned with its core values and commitments  8 \nto employees, customers,  communities , and the climate. Additionally, it was critical to 9 \nthe Company that any potential partner understand its unique relationship to the 10 \ncommunities it serves in northeastern Minnesota and make commitments  to honor that 11 \nrelationship.  The Partners are experienced infrastructure investors with a proven track 12 \nrecord and sufficient capital to support ALLETE’s future needs.  13 \n 14 \nD. Other Regulated Utility Proceedings  15 \nQ. What other regulated utility commission approvals are necessary for the 16 \nAcquisition?  17 \nA. The Acquisition needs to receive approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory 18 \nCommission (“FERC”) and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (“PSCW”).  19 \n 20 \nQ. Did the Commission request any information regarding these agency reviews?  21 \nA. Yes. Order Point 3(E) of the Commission’s referral Order requested the following: 22 \n“How do relevant and related dockets pending before the [FERC] , [PSCW] , and/or other 23 \nstate, federal or foreign government agencies impact the Commission’s consideration 24 \nof the [Acquisition]?”  25 \n 26 \n \n 9 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  Q. Beyond the Commission, FERC, and PSCW proceedings, are there any other 1 \npending government agency approvals  related to ALLETE’s utility companies , at 2 \nthis time?  3 \nA. While not currently pending, the Company will need to file the requisite notices under 4 \nthe Hart -Scott -Rodino Act with the Federal Trade Commission. That filing will be made 5 \nat a later date.  6 \n 7 \n1.  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  8 \nQ. What is the proceeding in which FERC is considering the Acquisition?  9 \nA. The FERC docket is Docket No. EC24 -105-000. The FERC authorization is under 10 \nSection 203 of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) , and ALLETE and the Partners are 11 \nrequesting FERC authorization for the disposition of jurisdictional facilities from the 12 \nproposed Acquisition .  The FERC issued a notice of filings on July 23, 2024 , setting 13 \nAugust 9, 2024 as the comment due date . On August 1, 2024 , the FERC issued an errata 14 \nnotice correcting and extending the comment due date to September 17, 2024.  15 \n 16 \nQ.  What will the FERC consider as part of that proceeding?  17 \nA. The FERC will consider whether the proposed Acquisition  complies with the 18 \nrequirements of Section 203 of the FPA and is consistent with the public interest.   The 19 \nFERC considers the following three factors in analyzing whether a proposed transaction 20 \nis consistent with the public interest: (1) the effect on competition; (2) the effect on 21 \nrates; and (3) the effect on regulation. In addition, FPA Section 203(a)(4) requires the 22 \nFERC to consider whether a proposed transaction will result in “cross -subsidization of 23 \na non -utility associate company or the pledge or encumbrance of utility assets for the 24 \nbenefit of an associate company.”  25 \n 26 \nQ. What is the current status of the FERC proceeding?  27 \nA. ALLETE anticipates that the FERC will issue a decision in the docket by early 2025.  28 \n 29 \n \n 10 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  2.  Public Service Commission of Wisconsin  1 \nQ. What is the proceeding in which the PSCW is considering the Acquisition?  2 \nA. The PSCW docket number is 5820 -DR-100. The PSCW issued a notice of proceeding 3 \non September 13, 2024, to consider the verified petition of ALLETE’s subsidiary, 4 \nSuperior Water, Light and Power Company (“SWL&P”) , for a declaratory ruling that 5 \nthe Acquisition does not require approval under the Wisconsin Utility Holding 6 \nCompany Act (“WUHCA”) and that the ALLETE holding company system will retain 7 \nits WUHCA exemption following the Acquisition. In the alternative, SWL&P seeks 8 \napproval of the Acquisition under WUHCA ’s takeover provision . 9 \n 10 \nQ. Has a schedule been established for the PSCW proceeding?  11 \nA. No.  The PSCW has not yet established a schedule for the proceeding.  12 \n 13 \nQ. What  will the PSCW consider as part of that proceeding?  14 \nA. The PSCW  will consider whether WUHCA applies to the Acquisition and , if so, how 15 \nWUHCA will apply and what conditions, if any, should be applied to a PSCW approval 16 \nof the Acquisition.  17 \n 18 \nQ. What is the current status of the PSCW proceeding?  19 \nA. SWL&P anticipates that the PSCW administrative law judge will hold a scheduling 20 \nconference and issue a scheduling order  in December 2024 or January 2025 . The nature 21 \nof the proceeding and the filing obligations of the parties to the proceeding are still to 22 \nbe determined. SWL&P anticipates that a final PSCW order in the docket will be issued 23 \nno later than mid -summer of 2025.  24 \n 25 \nIV. CONSISTENT  WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST  26 \nA. Standard of Review  27 \nQ. What determination must the Commission make  before approving the 28 \nAcquisition?  29 \nA. Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 sets f orth that the Commission must find that the Acquisition is 30 \n“consistent with the public interest.” The Commission has previously determined that 31 \n \n 11 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  this standard does not require a finding of public benefit, but requires a finding that the 1 \ntransaction is compatible with the public interest.4 2 \n 3 \nQ. What inquiry has the Commission requested to assist it in evaluating whether the 4 \nAcquisition is consistent with the public interest under Minn. Stat. §  216B.50?  5 \nA. In its referral Order, the Commission identified additional questions for further analysis 6 \nin Order Points 3(A) through 3( G). These questions, as posed by the Commission, are 7 \nas follows:  8 \nA. Are there any potential harms to the public interest from the proposed 9 \ntransaction, including in relation to cost or risk?  10 \nB. Are there any potential benefits to ratepayers, Minnesota, or the pub lic interest 11 \nfrom the proposed transaction?  12 \nC. Considering all relevant factors and applicable law, is the proposed transaction 13 \nconsistent with the public interest?  14 \nD. Are there regulatory requirements or commitments necessary to render the 15 \nproposed transaction consistent with the public interest?  16 \nE. How do relevant and related dockets pending before the Federal Energy 17 \nRegulatory Commission, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and/or other 18 \nstate, federal or foreign government agencies impact the Commission’s 19 \nconsideration of the proposed transaction?  20 \nF. How will the acquisition impact Minnesota Power’s union and non -union 21 \nworkforce and do the protections included in the acquisition agreement 22 \nadequately protect that workforce?  23 \nG. How will the acquisition impact Minnesota Power’s ability to comply with the 24 \ncarbon -free standard under § 216B.1691, including any modifications of plans 25 \nassociated with the Nemadji Trail Energy Center?  26 \nIn identifying these questions, the Commission did not prioritize any question over the 27 \nothers in importance but identified these to develop these issues on the record.  28 \n \n4 In the Ma tter of the Proposed Merger of Minnegasco, Inc. with and into Arkla, Inc. , Docket No. G008/PA -90-\n604, ORDER APPROVING MERGER AND ADOPTING AMENDED STIPULATION WITH MODIFICATIONS at 4 (Nov. 27, \n1990).  \n \n 12 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule   1 \nQ. How are Minnesota Power  and the Partners addressing these questions in this 2 \nproceeding  as of the filing of your Direct Testimony ? 3 \nA. The Petition filed on July 19, 2024,  its attachments, and the October 8 , 2024  4 \nSupplemental Filing provide extensive information regarding the Acquisition, its 5 \nbackground and reasoning, commitments of the parties to the Acquisition, and support 6 \nfor the Acquisition as consistent with the public interest. In addition, the discovery 7 \nprocess has begun and is ongoing, and the Direct Testimony  filed by the Company and 8 \nthe Partners provides additional information. The overall determination of the public 9 \ninterest, as well as addressing each of the questions identified by the Commission, will 10 \nultimately require consideration of the overall record in this proceeding. I address the 11 \nCommission’s  questions at a high level below  and certain questions (e.g., Order Points 12 \n3(E) through 3(G) ) in more detail  in my Direct Testimony , while other Company and 13 \nPartner witnesses underscore the information in the Petition at this point in the 14 \nproceeding. Minnesota Power and the Partners  will, of course, continue to answer 15 \nquestions and address any concerns throughout the proceeding.  16 \n 17 \nQ. To begin with, w ill the Acquisition result in any harms to the public interest, 18 \nincluding cost or risk?  19 \nA. No. There will be no adverse impact on customers, service cost or quality, employees, 20 \nor Minnesota Power’s communities. The Partners are not seeking to make changes to 21 \nthe operation of Minnesota Power. This Acquisition is not proposed to cut investments 22 \nor service or fundamentally chang e cost structures or long -term plans for Minnesota 23 \nPower.   These factors are discussed throughout the Petition and Direct Testimo ny. 24 \n 25 \nQ. What are the benefits of the Acquisition to Minnesota Powe r customers ? 26 \nA. ALLETE is currently the largest investor in renewable energy of any investor -owned 27 \nutility relative to its size, while also serving some of the nation ’s largest industrial 28 \ncustomers who represent the majority of Minnesota Power’s energy sales. Minnesota 29 \nPower  faces unique risk s due to its significant concentration of globally competitive 30 \nindustrial customers, along with the Company’s relatively small size . This result s in 31 \n \n 13 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  potentially challenging  situations for raising needed capital and navigating the volatile 1 \npublic markets. One benefit of the Acquisition  for customers is that the Company is no 2 \nlonger exposed to those public markets, but aligned with long -term, stable investors 3 \nsupportive of its strategy.  4 \n 5 \nFurther, as an over -arching matter, the Acquisition will provide Minnesota Power and, 6 \nthus, its customers access to capital that will allow for compliance with the Minnesota 7 \nCarbon Free Standard  and accelerated renewable energy standard under Minn.  Stat. 8 \n§ 216B.1691.  The Acquisition will allow Minnesota Power to partner with global 9 \nleaders in infrastructure deployment  who share Minnesota Power’s vision and are 10 \naligned with the utility’s value s. The Partners will provide Minnesota Power with the 11 \ncapital necessary to continue its leadership in the clean energy transition while 12 \nmaintaining reliable, safe, and affordable service for Minnesota Power customers  in the 13 \npublic interest . More detail about the benefit of improved access to capital is provided 14 \nin the Direct Testimony of Company Witnesses  Scissons  and Taran and Company and 15 \nPartner Witness Quackenbush . 16 \n 17 \nThe Acquisition will also ensure Minnesota Power remain s headquartered as a key 18 \nbusiness in Duluth , close to its customers in northeastern Minnesota , and operated by 19 \nits current employees who  understand  Minnesota Power ’s unique region and customer 20 \nmix. This transaction will allow Minnesota Power’s investors to be more closely aligned 21 \nwith employee, customer , and stakeholder needs  and, ultimately , the public interest in 22 \nMinnesota  as compared to the current large number of investors . The Partners continue 23 \nto express their support for continued economic development investments in the region 24 \nwithin Minnesota Power’s service territory.  These commitments are further outlined in 25 \nthe Petition and in the Merger Agreement attached to the Petition.  26 \n 27 \nQ. Are additional conditions necessary to ensure the Acquisition is in the public 28 \ninterest ? 29 \nA. As discussed extensively in the Petition  (including the Merger Agreement and 30 \nDefinitive Proxy Statement) , August 26, 2024 Reply Comments, September 16, 2024 31 \n \n 14 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  Update on Shareholder Approval, October 8, 2024 Supplemental Filing, and  Direct 1 \nTestimony filed by Minnesota Power and the Partners, the Acquisition includes 2 \nnumerous benefits and commitments sufficient to determine the Acquisition is 3 \nconsistent with the public interest.  4 \n 5 \nB. Maintaining Commission Authority  6 \nQ. Will the Commission’s jurisdiction over Minnesota Power change when  the 7 \nAcquisition is approved and close d? 8 \nA. No. The Commission’s jurisdiction after the Acquisition will be the same as its 9 \njurisdiction today.  The Commission will continue to have substantial oversight over 10 \nMinnesota Power and will continue to review and approve important proposals , 11 \nincluding setting rates, selecting a resource mix, and ensuring customers receive reliable 12 \nservice.  13 \n 14 \nMinnesota Power will continue to provide the same information and compliance filings 15 \nto the Commission , FERC, and PSCW  that are currently being provided. Minnesota 16 \nPower does not anticipate changes to the types of compliance filings made with the 17 \nCommission, FERC, or PSCW after the Acquisition has closed . Certain  reports that are 18 \ncurrently prepared at the ALLETE level would no longer be applicable  (like those for 19 \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission), but many will remain, such as all compliance 20 \nfilings before the Commission, FERC reporting (including FERC Form 1), and all 21 \nfinancial information relevant to the regulated utility that is provided during capital 22 \nstructure, affiliated interest, other financial and resource dockets, and rate case 23 \nproceedings for inspection by the Commission and interested parties . 24 \n 25 \nC. Commitments from the Partners as Part of this Acquisition  26 \nQ. Did the Partners make any specific commitments  in the Merger Agreement?  27 \nA. Yes. 28 \n 29 \nQ. Please describe some of these commitments .  30 \nA. The commitments made in the Merger Agreement include : 31 \n \n 15 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  • Minnesota Power will remain headquarte red in Duluth, Minnesota;  1 \n• Minnesota Power employees will maintain the same or better position and 2 \ncompensation and benefits for two years following the close of the transaction and 3 \nall existing collective bargaining agreements will be honored ; 4 \n• The name of the Company  will remain unchanged ;  5 \n• The Board of Directors will include at leas t one board member from Wisconsin and 6 \none board member from Minnesota who are appointed by the Company;  7 \n• The chief executive officer of ALLETE will be a member of the Board of Directors ; 8 \n• Current senior leadership will remain in place;  9 \n• The level of charitable contributions made by the Company in Minnesota Power’s 10 \nservice territory will be maintained for five years following the close of this 11 \ntransaction;  12 \n• The Company will not attempt to recover Acquisition costs from utility customers;  13 \nand 14 \n• As described further in the Direct T estimony of Company Witness Anderson  and 15 \nCompany and Partner Witness Lapson , with respect to ALLETE and the parent 16 \nentities up through the Partners, ALLETE will maintain certain corporate 17 \nseparateness (i.e., “ring -fencing”) commitments with respect to the parent and other 18 \nupstream entities.  19 \n 20 \nQ. Did Minnesota Power and the Partners make additional commitments  in the 21 \nPetition filed with the Commission on  July 19, 2024?   22 \nA. Yes. The additional commitments offered in the Petition include:  23 \n• Neither the Company nor the Partners intend to change Minnesota Power’s long - 24 \nstanding practices with regard to contractors. For example, the Company routinely 25 \ncontractually requires contractors and subcontractors to pay their workers prevailing 26 \nwage as evidenced by local collective bargaining agreements and to ascertain local 27 \nconditions, work rules , and union jurisdiction. The Company also seeks to deploy 28 \nunion labor wherever reasonably possible.  29 \n \n 16 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  • Minnesota Power commits that it will not reduce the overall scope or resources 1 \ndedicated to its affordability programs, nor current processes for residential 2 \ncustomer access to affordability programs following the completion of the 3 \nAcquisition.  4 \n• Though not required by Commission order, ALLETE will continue to publish its 5 \nCorporate Sustainability Report, which contains information related to 6 \nenvironmental, social, and governance issues, including the Company’s efforts to 7 \nencourage diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.  8 \n• The Partners share the Company’s support for a collaborative stakeholder approach 9 \nthat will continue going forward.  10 \n 11 \nQ. Why were these commitments made?  12 \nA. As stated previously, ALLETE chose these Partners because they share ALLETE’s core 13 \nvalues and support the Company’s strategy. Specifically, as discussed in the Direct 14 \nTestimony of Partner  Witnesses Bram and Alley , the Partners share the Company’s 15 \nview that customers are the center of its business and that serving customers and meeting 16 \ntheir needs is paramount, consistent with the Company’s long history. The Partners  also 17 \nrecognize the importance of the Company’s ties to the communities it serves and in 18 \nwhich it operates,  and that relationship will be unchanged by this transaction . The 19 \ncommitments made in the Merger Agreement and July 19, 2024  Petition were natural 20 \nextensions of an alignment in core values.  21 \n 22 \nD. Employee Retention and Attraction  23 \nQ. What additional information on the commitment to Minnesota Power employees 24 \ndid the Commission request in its referral Order?  25 \nA. The Commission, in Order Point 3(F), requested  the following : “How will the 26 \nacquisition impact Minnesota Power’s union and non -union workforce and do the 27 \nprotections included in the acquisition agreement adequately protect that workforce? ” 28 \n 29 \n \n 17 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  Q. How has this request been addressed between Minnesota Power  and the Partners?  1 \nA. Minnesota Power  and the Partners are committed to ensuring that Minnesota Power 2 \nremains a sought -after employer  and that current employees, both bargaining employees 3 \nand non -bargaining employees, continue to feel appreciated and that Minnesota Power 4 \nis able to retain its talented workforce. In light of this, certain commitments were 5 \nmemorialized in the Merger Agreement for full transparency to  Minnesota Power’s 6 \nemployees. Company Witness Krollman discusses these commitments, and why 7 \nMinnesota Power and the Partners sought to memorialize these commitments in writing, 8 \nin her Direct Testimony.  9 \n 10 \nV. MINNESOTA’S STATE ENERGY  POLICY  11 \nQ. How does the State of Minnesota set energy policy for regulated utilities like 12 \nMinnesota Power?  13 \nA. Energy policy in the State of Minnesota is set through a combination of laws passed by 14 \nthe Minnesota Legislature (statutes), rules, and orders from the Commission.  15 \n 16 \nQ. Is there  a specific policy governing decarbonization of electric utilities in 17 \nMinnesota?  18 \nA. Yes. In 2023 , Minnesota passed the Carbon Free Standard  under Minn. Stat. 19 \n§ 216B.1691 , which requires electric utilities to deliver a power supply that is 100 20 \npercent carbon free by 2040. The Commission currently has an open proceeding to 21 \nprovide additional guidance on the implementation of the Carbon Free Standard, in 22 \nDocket No. E999/CI -23-151. The Commission, in Order Point 3(G) of its referral Order, 23 \nrequested additional information on whether the Acquisition would impact Minnesota 24 \nPower’s ability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard.  25 \n 26 \nQ. Please describe Minnesota Power’s history of complying with Minnesota’s evolving 27 \nclean energy polic ies. 28 \nA. Minnesota Power has an established track record as a clean energy leader in the State 29 \nof Minnesota, as ALLETE has nationally . Minnesota Power met the State’s Renewable 30 \nEnergy  Standard , which required electric utilities to generate 25 percent of their power 31 \n \n 18 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  from renewable resources by 2025, a decade early in 2015. Minnesota Power is the only 1 \nelectric utility to have met the State’s energy conservation  goals for 14 consecutive 2 \nyears. In 2020, Minnesota Power became the first electric utility in the State of 3 \nMinnesota to deliver 50 percent renewable energy to customers and today  continues to 4 \nlead the state by delivering the highest percentage of renewable energy to customers.  5 \n 6 \nAdditionally, affordability is key , and Minnesota Power’s average residential customers 7 \nenjoy the lowest total monthly electric bills5 in the state while the Company offers best - 8 \nin-class affordability programs for income -eligible cust omers, including being the first 9 \nin the state to move to a self -declare eligibility system for energy assistance.  10 \n 11 \nQ. How will the Acquisition impact Minnesota Power’s ability to comply with the 12 \nCarbon  Free Standard under  Minn. Stat.  § 216B.1691 , as the Commission inquired 13 \nin Order Point 3(G) ?      14 \nA. This Acquisition will provide Minnesota Power with long -term access to patient capital 15 \nthat will fund the investments required to achieve the transition to a carbon -free future, 16 \nassisting the Company in its ability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard. Minnesota 17 \nPower will continue to be subject to all the requirements established by the Commission 18 \nand Minnesota law.  Company Witness Taran further addresses how access to capital is 19 \ncritical to achieving these standards, and GIP and CPP  Investments  Witnesses Bram and 20 \nAlley underscore the Partners’ shared commitment to these standards.  21 \n 22 \nQ. Will the Acquisition  impact or modify Minnesota Power’s plans associated with 23 \nthe Nemadji Trail Energy Center?  24 \nA.  Minnesota Power will remain fully regulated by the Commission , and, as such, all 25 \nMinnesota Power resource decisions , like those associated with the Nemadji Trail 26 \nEnergy Center , will be made through Commission processes like the Integrated 27 \nResource Plan  (“IRP”) , resource acquisition dockets,  and cost recovery proceedings. To 28 \naddress the Commission’s questio n in Order Point 3(G), the  Acquisition does not 29 \n \n5 Electric Rate Comparison , Minnesota Public Utilities Commission ( Mar.  12, 2024 ), https://mn.gov/puc -\nstat/documents/pdf_files/Rates%20Data%20Slides.pdf .  \n \n 19 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  change this oversight, nor the Company’s customer load forecast  or resource needs. 1 \nMinnesota Power intends to update the Commission on plans associated with the 2 \nNemadji Trail Energy Center, along with the associated energy and capacity attributes 3 \nrequired to meet the region’s energy needs, including procurement of energy resources, 4 \nin its upcoming IRP, due on March 1, 2025.  5 \n 6 \nQ. Please describe how the existing IRP Order affects Minnesota Power’s current 7 \nRequest for Proposal  process for procuring generation resources . 8 \nA. The Commission’s January 9, 2023 Order in Minnesota Power’s 2021 IRP  (Docket N o. 9 \nE015/RP -21-33) provides instructions for future resource a cquisition procurement. 10 \nThese include: ensuring the Request for Proposal (“RFP”) is consistent  with the most 11 \nrecent IRP order and direction regarding size, type , and timing of required resources; 12 \nproviding notice to stakeholders and the  Department of Commerce upon RFP issuances ; 13 \nproviding updates on any changes or deviations from timelines ; includ ing options for 14 \nboth Power Purchase Agreements (“ PPAs”) and Build Own Transfer ( “BOT”) 15 \nproposals, and more. Additionally, the January 9, 2023 IRP Order requires that “in 16 \ninstances where Minnesota Power or an affiliate proposes a project, [the Company will] 17 \nengage an independent evaluator to oversee the bid process and provide a report to the 18 \nCommission .”  19 \n 20 \nMinnesota Power follows these requirements relate d to resource procurement and  also 21 \nincorporates best practices for ensuring that customers and communities benefit as much 22 \nas possible from resource acquisition. These best practices include  limiting risk where 23 \npossible, ensuring affordability , and selecting projects that provide the best value for 24 \ncustomers  and have the greatest likelihood of being built, preferences  for prevailing 25 \nwage and local u nion labor , and support for  supplier diversity efforts . Additionally, the 26 \nCompany follows formal internal processes under legal guidance  and with oversight 27 \nfrom an  independent third -party evaluator  to ensure separation of internal development 28 \nof project submission into a competitive RFP and t he RFP selection process . Minnesota 29 \nPower will continue to follow these processes in compliance with federal and state 30 \nrequirements and Commission orders.  31 \n \n 20 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule   1 \nQ. With respect to not only generation resources but also other procurement and 2 \ncontracting, h ow will the Company ensure that affiliates of the Partners are not 3 \ngiven preferential selection in any of Minnesota Power’s procurement processes ? 4 \nA. Minnesota Power’s obligation to follow Minnesota law, including Minn. Stat. § 5 \n216B.48 on Affiliated Interests, and Commission orders like the January 9, 2023 IRP 6 \nOrder, remain unchanged. The  Company will continue to follow all State and 7 \nCommission requirements related to affiliated interest agreements, which include 8 \nengaging an independent evaluator if an affiliate provides a proposal in response to a 9 \nresource acquisition RFP. Company Witness  Anderson discusses additional information 10 \nand protections the Company proposes to help provide further assurance of fair and 11 \nreasonable business dealings – a longstanding and continuing core value of Minnesota 12 \nPower.  Partner  Witnesses Bram and Alley further underscore these same values within 13 \nthe Partners’ businesses. Finally, the Commission retains final authority to approve, 14 \ndeny , or modify any new resource acquisitions for Minnesota Power , and to review both 15 \naffiliated interest agreements and cost recovery proposals in future regulatory 16 \nproceedings.  In short, the Company , in cooperation with the Partners, remains 17 \ncommitted to integrity in business dealings at all levels, and is both bound by and 18 \ncommitted to the Commission’s continuing oversight .  19 \n 20 \nVI. CONCLUSION  21 \nQ. Please summarize your Direct Testimony  for the Commission’s consideration.  22 \nA. My Direct Testimony discussed the underlying policy reasons for the proposed 23 \nAcquisition of all outstanding shares of ALLETE by the Partners and why the 24 \nAcquisition  is in the public interest. Minnesota Power has been a leader in the State of 25 \nMinnesota in decarbonizing its electric generation fleet and transitioning to renewable 26 \nenergy , as evidenced by its ability to provide  the most renewable energy to customers 27 \nin Minnesota  today . Minnesota Power has a unique connection to the customers and 28 \ncommunities it serves and  values its employees as cent ral to all we do each day , and the 29 \nCompany  deliberately  chose partners who share these values . This intentional 30 \npartnership with established long-term infrastructure investors, CPP Investments  and 31 \n \n 21 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Direct and Schedule  GIP, will allow Minnesota Power to access capital for the investments needed in the 1 \nclean energy transition, while removing this relatively small energy company with 2 \noutsized risk due to its unique customer mix from the volatile public markets  driven by 3 \nquarter -to-quarter  financial results . Additionally, this Acquisition does nothing to 4 \nchange the oversight that the Commission has over Minnesota Power’s operations, rates, 5 \nresource planning , or resource acquisitions. The Company’s obligations to comply with 6 \nMinnesota’s energy policy and Commission directives are unchanged by this 7 \nAcquisition and, in fact, are supported by this Acquisition.  8 \n 9 \nQ.

Please summarize your qualifications and experience.  11 \nA. I have over 20 years of experience in the utility industry with a background in finance 12 \nand investments. I earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree with a focus 13 \non Finance from the University of Minnesota Duluth in 2000. I spent the first ten years 14 \nof my career working for Northern Asset Management (“NAM ”), an investment group 15 \nthat focused on gas and electric utilities. I started my career at NAM as a research analyst 16 \nand ended as an equity portfolio manager.

I have also led and/or 24 \nparticipated in financial  forecast ing, treasury, debt and equity issuances  and executing 25 \non the corporate strategy of ALLETE  and its family of businesses.  26 \n 27 \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Direct Testimony and the \nPetition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically \ndefined, references to “ALLETE” i ndicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota \nPower and all regulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n \n 2 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  Q.

I support th e approval of the proposed Acquisition which will 11 \nprovide the Company with the equity capital needed to execute its long -range capital 12 \nplans, particularly that of Minnesota’s legislation requiring  Minnesota electric utilities 13 \nto source retail sales with 100 percent carbon -free energy by 2040 . Specifically, I will 14 \ndiscuss  ALLETE’s approach to the Acquisition, including how ALLETE identif ied the 15 \nappropriate partners for both the utility and non -utility businesses of ALLETE, 16 \ngovernance of the utility today and how it will exist after the Acquisition , how investor 17 \nrelations may change to the benefit of Minnesota Power’s customers after the 18 \nAcquisition, and how utility strategy and planning will remain with the utility after the 19 \nAcquisition, just as it is today.  20 \n 21 \nQ.

SUMMARY OF THE ACQUISITION  18 \nQ. How has th e Acquisition  been summarized to date?  19 \nA. The Petition summarizes the description of the Acquisition (page 14 ), as well as 20 \nproviding the terms of the Acquisition in the Merger Agreement (Attachment B to the 21 \nPetition) and extensive detail regarding the process leading to the Merger Agreement 22 \n(Attachment L to the Petition ). In addition, Company Witness Jennifer J. Cady provides 23 \na discussion of the interrelationship of Alloy Parent LLC (“Alloy Parent”) , the entity 24 \ncreated to be the parent of ALLETE, Inc.,  and the Partners  in her Direct Testimony .  25 \n 26 \nQ. What was your role in the Acquisition process  pre-signing ? 27 \nA.  I was a part of the core ALLETE team from the beginning , including ALLETE Board 28 \nof Directors (the “Board”) meetings and the fireside chats  through out the process to  its 29 \ncompletion.  30 \n 31 \n \n 4 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  Q. What were the reasons for the Acquisition?  1 \nA. Minnesota Power  is entering into a historic period where the need to upgrade aging 2 \ninfrastructure and enable the clean en ergy transformation , combined with significant 3 \nutility load growth driven by electrificat ion, domestic manufacturing , and advanced 4 \ncomputing , results in extremely large capital needs  and potential financing challenges . 5 \nAs discussed in detail in  the ‘Background of the Merger’ section of Attachment L  to the 6 \nPetition  (beginning at page 41 of 239) , the Company  evaluated the challenges of being  7 \na relatively small energy company with unique industrial customer risk and  outsized 8 \ncapital requirements , which include an approximately $20  billion capital plan over the 9 \nnext 20 years to reduce carbon, expand renewables, enhance resiliency and reliability 10 \nof the transmission grid, and also to support the Company’s non -regulated renewable 11 \nbusinesse s that bring diversity to ALLETE . The Company determined that finding the 12 \nright partners  to help the Company to execute and finance ALLETE’s Sustainability -in- 13 \nAction strategy could provide benefits to its many stakeholders.  14 \n 15 \nAfter a thorough and rigorous  process,  the Company identified  the right Partners to work 16 \nwith to support ALLETE as it addresses historic changes  facing the Company, industr y 17 \nand the region.  Company Witnesses Cady and Joshua D. Taran provide more 18 \ninformation on this strategy and the capital needs in their Direct Testimony.  19 \n 20 \nQ. How does current trading of ALLETE stock in public markets (i.e., short -term  21 \ntrading) impact the Company and the Minnesota Power utility specifically?  22 \nA. Short -term trading can lead to increased volatility in the stock price as investors can buy 23 \nand sell shares easily – this is true for ALLETE stock as well as any other publicly 24 \ntraded stock. With ALLETE’s Sustainability -in-Action strategy, which includes an 25 \napproximately $20 billion capital plan over the next 20 years  (mentioned above ), access 26 \nto available and patient equity capital is incredibly valuable. The majority of ALLETE’s 27 \ncapital needs are driven by Minnesota Power  and its Energy Forward2 plan to build a 28 \n100 percent carbon -free future ; therefore, p artners that have a long -term view , 29 \n \n2 Please see https://www.mnpower.com/energyforward  for more information  on Minnesota Power’s long -standing  \ncarbon -free energy vision.  \n \n 5 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  willing ness to be patient around the timing of dividends , and flexibility around equity 1 \ninfusions will enable efficient execution of the capital plan. Trying to issue additional 2 \nshares during a public market downturn could lead to limiting or delaying the necessary 3 \ncapital spend to execute the Company’s strategy. Having to issue equity annually, and 4 \nthe risk of the inevitable economic cycles, is something the ALLETE Board saw value 5 \nin mitigating with this transaction.  Company Witness Taran provides more discussion 6 \nof this issue, which is further underscored by Company and Partner Witness John 7 \nQuackenbush . 8 \n 9 \nQ. Was ALLETE determined to complete a transaction  from the beginning of the 10 \nprocess?  11 \nA. No. ALLETE, with direction from the ALLETE Board of Directors , entered into the 12 \nprocess to see if there was an interested acquisition partner  or partners  that valued the 13 \ncompany, employees, ALLETE’s  strategy, and all the many stakeholders  of ALLETE’s 14 \ncompanie s. There was also a particular focus on the alignment of culture and values, as 15 \nwell as the ability to finance the Company’s capital plan driven primarily by the 16 \nregulated utility needs and obligations to achieve Minnesota state energy policy goals.  17 \nAs discussed in the Petition, ALLETE continually evaluated the transaction with a 18 \nstand -alone plan  in tandem with due diligence of the Partners  and are excited to have 19 \nfound these Partners to help execute ALLETE’s strategy.  20 \n 21 \nQ. Please explain how the Company  decided  that CPP Investments  and GIP were the 22 \nright Partners . 23 \nA. CPP Investments  and GIP are two of  the largest , most recognizable infrastructure 24 \ninvestor s in the world , with experience investing in utility , renewable  and energy 25 \ninfrastructure companies  globally . As discussed in the Direct Testimony of Partner  26 \nWitnesses Johnathan Bram and Andrew Alley  and the Petition, CPP Investments  and 27 \nGIP understand the extensive capital needs required to undertake large and visionary 28 \nmarket changes, like Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard , discussed in more detail in the 29 \nDirect Testimony of Company Witness  Cady. The Company was impressed that these  30 \nsophisticated  Partners performed extensive diligence on ALLETE/Minnesota Power 31 \n \n 6 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  and its ongoing strategy , and are aligned in transitioning to more renewable sources of 1 \nenergy, modernizing the transmission and distribution grid while meeting evolving 2 \ncustomer needs. Additionally, t he Partners are focused  on long-term investments  and 3 \nare willing to look through short -term market volatility that impacts public equity 4 \nmarkets  as discussed in the Direct Testimony  of Partner  Witnesses Bram and Alley,  and 5 \nof Company Witness  Taran . Important  to the Board and management, through many 6 \ndiscussions and ultimately the Merger Agreement terms, the Partners demonstrated that 7 \nthey valued the existing employees and the company's  culture and understand  the 8 \ncritical  role the Company plays as a corporate partner in the region.  9 \n 10 \nQ. What process did Minnesota Power undertake to evaluate the Partner s prior to 11 \nexecuting the Merger Agreement?  12 \nA.  As discussed in detail in the  ‘Background of the Merger’ section of Attachment L in the 13 \nPetition, the initial screening3 was performed by J.P. Morgan,  one of the largest and 14 \nmost experienced investment banks in the industry. The initial criteria centered on th e 15 \nprospects ’ interest and perceived  value regarding  investing in small -cap utilities  along 16 \nwith the ability to fund a large go -forward capital plan. As the process progressed  17 \nthrough fireside chats and management presentations , discussions evolved to confirm  18 \nalignment with the ALLETE  values and strategy  and the capital investment needed to 19 \nfund execution , followed by commitments  to the region, employees, customers, 20 \nregulators and the environment . The competitive process was driven by ALLETE  as a 21 \nwhole  with cle ar goals in mind and all stakeholders considered .   22 \n 23 \nQ. Despite these considerations, did ALLETE also consider as an alternative 24 \ncontinuing to operate as a wholly separate, publicly -traded entity?  25 \nA. Yes.  As an alternative to partnering with investors dedicated to long -term investments 26 \nand results in the energy sector, the Company always considered the possibility of 27 \ncontinuing in its current, publicly -traded form. This analysis was referred to as the 28 \n“stand -alone” plan, which is referenced in the  “Background  of the Merger”  in the 29 \n \n3 As discussed in the Definitive Proxy Statement (Attachment L to the Petition), other potential investors were also \nreviewed prior to focusing the inquiry on the Partners.  \n \n 7 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  Definitive Proxy Statement (Attachment L of the Petition ). More specifically, the stand - 1 \nalone plan  references  a planning scenario  of the Company that excludes partners from 2 \naiding in the future financing of the Company.   3 \n 4 \nQ. What was the biggest concern with the stand -alone plan?  5 \nA. When the Board reviewed the  stand -alone plan , it highlighted the annual pressure on 6 \nissuing equity shares in the public market  (discussed in more detail by Company 7 \nWitness Taran) and the amount of Company time and resources that would be required 8 \nto execute  on financing ALLETE’s  Sustainability -in-Action strategy . Solely focusing 9 \non financing the investments necessary to  meet Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard 10 \nhighlighted these risks and challenges. As discussed at pages 50 to 51 of the Company’s 11 \nDefinitive  Proxy Statement (Attachment L to the Petition) , the plan also identified 12 \npotential constraints and risks regarding economic cycles  impacting access to capital 13 \nwhich could lead to delays in projects being completed and a higher cost of capital for 14 \nall of ALLETE.  15 \n 16 \nQ. How were the Minnesota Power utility and its customers considered as part of this 17 \nevaluation process ? 18 \nA. Customers were central to the Company’s considerations  in this evaluation process . All 19 \nMinnesota Power customers, from low -income resident s to large industrial customers , 20 \nwere considered in this evaluation process, along with many other stakeholder 21 \nperspectives . ALLETE’s capital plan is being driven by Minnesota Power and its need 22 \nto ensure reliability and resiliency while  meet ing Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard . 23 \nMinnesota Power is well-positioned  with existing critical transmission infrastructure in 24 \nkey geographic  locations  to support investments in the transmission system  that will 25 \nsupport  reliability and resiliency and increasingly clean generation  – not just in the 26 \nCompany’s service territory , but in the entire region.   27 \n 28 \nAs part of the consideration of a transaction and ultimately selecting GIP and CPP 29 \nInvestments  as Partners, the Company determined that f inding partners  who are aligned 30 \nwith the Company’s values  and strategy and have the financial resources to support 31 \n \n 8 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  Minnesota Power in this critical  transition is a benefit  for Minnesota Power’s customers . 1 \nThe commitments set forth in Section III.B.4  of the Petition ( which references 2 \ncommitments  included in the Merger Agreement ) also ensure that Minnesota Power will 3 \nmaintain its employees , benefits,  and headquarters  as well as continue to be active in 4 \nthe many communities it serves  and are discussed further in the Direct Testimony of 5 \nCompany Witness  Cady . 6 \n 7 \nQ. How w ill the Partners be more capable  to support Minnesota Power’s 8 \ndecarbonization strategy  than if the Company remain s as a listed company on a 9 \npublic market?  10 \nA. The Partners have the ability to not only provide the required equity capital and do so 11 \non a more reliable, readily available basis  (i.e., without having to complete equity 12 \nplacements on the open market, in large quantities relative to the size of ALLETE) , but 13 \nalso to exercise more patience with respect to quarterly earnings and dividends due to a 14 \nfocus on long -term investments.  This equity capital can be raised based on the Partners’ 15 \nclear understanding of the Company’s goals and investments , and a shared interest in 16 \nadvancing the clean energy transition over the years of progress that will be required,  17 \nbypassing the complexities and fickleness of the public markets.  The Partners discuss 18 \nthese shared interests in the Direct Testimony  of Partner Witnesses Bram and Alley . 19 \nFurther, Company Witness Taran and Witness  Quackenbush , respectively,  provide 20 \nadditional analysis on the public markets.  21 \n 22 \nQ. How does the Acquisition help support Minnesota’s State energy policy goals, as 23 \ncompared to leaving ALLETE to seek capital in public markets?  24 \nA. To meet Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard  by 2040, it is critical for the Company to 25 \nhave reliable access to equity capital.  Recognizing that ALLETE is a relatively small 26 \ncompany  with significant  equity needs in the coming years,  without the Acquisition  27 \nthere is no guarantee that the Company will be able to access the capital it needs for 28 \nMinnesota Power’s clean energy transition investment s. Seeking financing in the public 29 \nmarkets  at the same time as larger peers looking to raise even greater dollar amount s 30 \nposes a challenge  due to t he volatility and short -term focus of public markets in contrast 31 \n \n 9 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  with the patient capital from private investors like the Partners, who support long -term 1 \ngoals. Th e Acquisition is expected to provide more reliable access  to equity  capital, 2 \nunaffected by share price fluctuations, benefiting Minnesota Power customers by 3 \nreducing capital raising risks .  4 \n 5 \nPost-Acquisition , ALLETE would transition from a public investor base to the Partners 6 \nand their funds , who are  sophisticated, long -term investors aligned with ALLETE’s 7 \nSustainability -in-Action strategy  for all of the ALLETE companies . This choice 8 \npreserves ALLETE’s commitment and its success in serving  customers. The proposed 9 \nAcquisition will not alter the regulatory authority of the Commission  over Minnesota 10 \nPower . As discussed in the Petition, Minnesota Power will remain unchanged in terms 11 \nof regulatory requirements, customer profile, system load, employee obligations, utility 12 \ninfrastructure, financing needs, and alignment with State policy goals.  13 \n 14 \nIV. GOVERNANCE OF THE UTILITY  15 \nQ. What is the current function of the ALLETE Board of Directors?  16 \nA. As described in ALLETE’s annual proxy statement ,4 the current function of the  Board 17 \nis to provide oversight focused on ensuring that the Company is managed in a manner 18 \nthat builds long -term value for our shareholders, customers, employees, and 19 \ncommunities.  20 \n 21 \nThe Board takes an active role overseeing ALLETE’s strategy and approves the 22 \nstrategic direction of the Company, any changes in long -term capital structure, 23 \nsignificant transactions, and any entry into substantial new lines of business.  24 \n 25 \nQ. Does Minnesota Power have its own Board of Directors?  26 \nA. No. Minnesota Power  and ALLETE ’s Board are one in the same . When the Board holds 27 \nmeetings, it discusses both utility and non -utility business. However, the Board has an 28 \n \n4 ALLETE’s SEC Form DEFA14  filed Mar. 28, 2024.  \n \n 10 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  obligation to review Minnesota Power strategy , operational and safety performance, 1 \nbudget, and forecast  and to approve major regulatory filings and project decisions .  2 \n 3 \nQ. What is the current makeup of the ALLETE Board?  4 \nA. As detailed in ALLETE’s annual proxy statement, t he current Board consists of ten 5 \nmembers, nine independent directors and Bethany  M. Owen , the ALLETE Chair, 6 \nPresident, and CEO. The current Board is elected annually by the shareholders as a 7 \nvoting recommendation included in ALLETE’s annual Proxy Statement (SEC Schedule 8 \n14A).  The goal is for the Board to consist of members with  diverse backgrounds and 9 \nperspectives  and expertise to direct  the Company on strategic matters . 10 \n  11 \nQ. What will be the makeup of the ALLETE Board of Directors after the Acquisition, 12 \nif approved by the Commission?  13 \nA. As explained by the Direct Testimony  of Partner Witnesses Bram and Alley,  and in the 14 \nPetition, ALLETE will continue to have its own Board of Directors (the “Post - 15 \nAcquisition Board”)  with similar responsibilities and authority to  the current Board. At 16 \nleast one Director must be from Minnesota, another from Wisconsin , and at least two 17 \nwill be independen t. The CEO of ALLETE, Bethany M. Owen , will also be on the Post- 18 \nAcquisition Board.  19 \n 20 \nQ. Will Minnesota Power have a separate Board of Directors?  21 \nA. No. Once again, the  Post-Acquisition Board structure and role will be similar to the 22 \nstructure  of the current Board . 23 \n 24 \nQ. Will the Partners select Directors and how will those Directors be identified and 25 \nseated on the Board of Directors after the Acquisition?  26 \nA. Similar to current Board members  who are determined by the equity owners, the 27 \nPartners will appoint the Directors of the ALLETE  Board . Please see the Direct 28 \nTestimony of Partner  Witness es Bram and Alley for additional details on governance.  29 \n 30 \n \n 11 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  Q. How does Minnesota Power currently undertake the development of strategy and 1 \nplanning?  2 \nA. Minnesota Power’s strategy development is a comprehensive and collaborative process 3 \nthat is led by a dedicated cross -functional team of experts. The team aggregates and 4 \nconsiders key inputs from both within the Company and from external sources including 5 \ncustomer data and forecasts, technology assessments, policy and regulatory guidelines, 6 \nenergy markets, operational realities and stakeholder input to develop Integrated 7 \nResource Plan s (“IRP”) and Integrated Distribution Plan s (“IDP”) that guide  Minnesota 8 \nPower’s  future investments upon Commission approval.  9 \n 10 \nQ. Are changes to strategy and planning for Minnesota Power anticipated after the 11 \nAcquisition?  12 \nA. No changes as to how Minnesota Power develops its strategy are anticipated after the 13 \nAcquisition. Currently, talented professionals at Minnesota Power develop strategic 14 \nplans and submit them to the Board for approval. Following the transaction , strategic 15 \nplans will still be developed by professionals at Minnesota Power and submitted to the 16 \nBoard for approval , and the strategic planning is expected to be developed by the same 17 \nteams and individuals because of commitments by the Partners to the continuity of 18 \nMinnesota Power’s workforce . Additionally, as further detailed in the Direct Testimony 19 \nof Company Witness Cady, the Partners are supportive of Minnesota Power’s 20 \ncollaborative approach to stakeholder engagement going forward.  21 \n 22 \nWhile the Partners have extensive experience with infrastructure assets, t hey do not 23 \nhave or intend to hire personnel that could replace the Company’s current teams or 24 \nexpertise. Through diligence of the existing Minnesota Power strategy, the Partners are 25 \naligned and committed to support the execution of the ALLETE strategy with the 26 \nexisting team. In short, t he Partners ’ role post -Acquisition would be similar to that of 27 \nthe current ALLETE Board.  28 \n 29 \n \n 12 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  Q. Will the Commission retain all of its authority over Minnesota Power’s strategy 1 \nand planning?  2 \nA. Yes. The Commission’s regulatory oversight of Minnesota Power will remain the same  3 \nand it will retain regulatory oversight of important decisions such as setting rates, 4 \nselecting the resource mix, and approving IRPs and IDPs . The proposed Acquisition is 5 \na change in financial investors, but it does not change the critical role of the Commission 6 \nor change the Company’s operations.  7 \n 8 \nQ. Do you expect Minnesota Power and its customers will benefit from the experience 9 \nof the Partners investments in other utility and infrastructure companies?  10 \nA. Yes, the Company  and its customers may benefit from the scale and expertise of the 11 \nPartners , but achieving operational synergies was not a core catalyst for the transaction  12 \nas discussed in the Direct Testimony of Partner Witnesses Alley and Bram . Company 13 \nWitnesses Cady and Colin B. Anderson discuss how affiliated interest of the Partners 14 \nwill be managed in competitive resource acquisitions and procurement, respectively.  15 \n 16 \nV. INVESTOR RELATIONS  17 \nQ. How are investor relations and shareholder services currently managed for 18 \nALLETE?  19 \nA. ALLETE has an investor relations and shareholder services team that currently includes 20 \nthree dedicated employees and is supported by the ALLETE CEO, CFO and Treasurer 21 \nalong with other senior management  and the Corporate C ommunications team . 22 \n 23 \nQ. Does Minnesota Power pay for any of the costs associated with these investor 24 \nrelations activities?  25 \nA. Yes. The Commission has historically approved recovery of  50 percent of investor 26 \nrelation expenses through customer  rates in each of its rate cases.  27 \n 28 \n \n 13 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  Q. Will investor relations activities still be necessary for some time period after the 1 \nAcquisition?  2 \nA. Yes, once the Acquisition closes and into the following calendar year, shareholder 3 \nservices anticipates that significant resources will be needed to assist shareholders in 4 \nestablishing cost basis and other information. After completing work with selling 5 \nshareholders, the expectation is there will be overall less time and resources dedicated 6 \nto shareholder activities and those allocated savings will flow back to Minnesota Power 7 \ncustomers in subsequent rate cases.  8 \n 9 \nQ. Will the investor relations and shareholder services team continue to provide value 10 \nafter the Acquisition?  11 \nA. Yes. Post-Acquisition, Minnesota Power will remain an investor -owned public utility, 12 \nbut will be privately held instead of publicly traded. The Company  will still need to 13 \nraise debt publicly and will need to support those offerings and address  debt investor 14 \nquestions . The Partners will also have ongoing reporting needs and questions regarding 15 \ntheir investment, and it will be the Company’s responsibility to support the new Partners 16 \nas ALLETE’s new equity investors.  17 \n 18 \nQ. What will be the impact to the investor relations and sha reholders services  role if 19 \nthe Acquisition does not close ? 20 \nA. If the Acquisition does not close, ALLETE will need to commit considerably  more time 21 \nand resources to the investor relations team. The n eed to raise hundred s of  millions of 22 \ndollars of equity and debt annually would require a large expansion of the investor base. 23 \nALLETE  would have to market the Company at as many conferences and meet with as 24 \nmany potential and current investors as reasonably possible  in North America and 25 \nglobally . The execution of the debt and equity offerings is taxing on the entire 26 \norganization as information is requested and provided, data rooms are established , and 27 \nsenior management  is responsible for answering questions regarding  strategy and 28 \nperformance.  29 \n 30 \n \n 14 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nScissons  Direct  VI.

INTRODUCTION AND  QUALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ. Please state your name and business address.  2 \nA. My name is Joshua D. Taran , and my business address is 30 West Superior Street, 3 \nDuluth, Minnesota 55802.  4 \n 5 \nQ. By whom are you employed and in what position?  6 \nA. I am employed by ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.1 My current position is 7 \nManager – Financial Planning . 8 \n 9 \nQ. Please summarize your qualifications and experience.  10 \nA. I have 13 years of experience in utility  finance. I have a Bachelor of Business 11 \nAdministration in Finance from the University of Minnesota Duluth. I joined ALLETE 12 \nin 2011 as a Financial Analyst. In 2018, I became a Senior Financial Analyst and was 13 \nnamed Supervisor – Financial Planning in 2020. I have been in my current position since 14 \n2022.  As the Manager – Financial Planning, I am responsible for financial forecasting 15 \nfor ALLETE.  16 \n 17 \nQ. Have you ever testified in any other proceeding?  18 \nA. Yes. I previously provided testimony in Minnesota Power’s most recent general rate 19 \ncase before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”) (Docket No. 20 \nE015/GR -23-155) on capital structure and cost of capital . Additionally, I testified in 21 \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission  Docket No. ER24 -1473 -000 to support 22 \nALLETE’s request to recover construction work in progress costs in rate base  for 23 \ntransmission investments . 24 \n 25 \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Direct Testimony and the \nPetition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically \ndefined, references to “ALLETE” i ndicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota \nPower and all regulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n \n 2 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Q. What is the purpose of your Direct Testimony ? 1 \nA. The purpose of my Direct Testimony is to provide an understanding of the basics of 2 \nutility financing , credit metrics,  and ALLETE’s capital needs, including those of 3 \nMinnesota Power. First, I identify the portions of the Petition of Minnesota Power for 4 \nthe Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP 5 \nInvestments”) and Global Infrastructure Partner s (“GIP”) (together, the “Partners”) (the 6 \n“Petition”). Next, I discuss the capital needs of ALLETE and Minnesota Power. Then, 7 \nI provide a discussion of how regulated utility financing works in the public markets 8 \nand with individual investors. I will also discuss risks and challenges associated with 9 \npublic equity market s, including how credit ratings  interact with these markets . Finally, 10 \nI discuss the potential consequences of Minnesota Power not having access to capital 11 \nwhen necessary, particularly given the need to ensure compliance with Minnesota’s 12 \nCarbon Free Standard . 13 \n 14 \nQ. Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding?  15 \nA. Not at this time.  16 \n 17 \nII. THE PETITION  18 \nQ. What sections  of the Petition do you sponsor ? 19 \nA. I sponsor the following sections of the Petition:  20 \n• Section IV.B.1.g: Copies of resolutions by the directors authorizing the petition 21 \nfor the issue or assumption of liability in respect to which the petition is made; 22 \nand if approval of stockholders has been obtained, copies of the resolution of the 23 \nstockholders shall be furnished (Minn. R. 7825.1400, Subp. G) ; 24 \n• Section IV.C.1 : Minn. R. 7825.1700: Petition for approval of transaction;  25 \n• Section. IV.C.2 : Minn.

What Attachments to the  Petition  do you sponsor?  2 \nA. I sponsor the following Attachments to the Petition : 3 \n• Attachment J -1: July 3, 2024 Moody’s Ratings Credit Opinion ; 4 \n• Attachment J -2: May 7, 2024 S&P Global Ratings Credit Opinion ; and  5 \n• Attachment M: Holder Position History . 6 \n 7 \nIII. ALLETE AND MINNESOTA POWER CAPITAL NEEDS  AND ACCESS  8 \nA. The Company’s Capital Needs  9 \nQ. What are ALLETE and Minnesota Power’s capital needs?  10 \nA. The Company has a significant need for capital from investors at levels that are several 11 \ntimes the size of historic levels  to continue ALLETE’s Sustainability -in-Action 12 \nStrategy, which seeks to decarbonize Minnesota Power’s generation portfolio while 13 \ncontinuing to provide safe, affordable , and reliable electric service to our customers and 14 \ncommunities.  As part of this strategy, ALLETE will need to make substantial 15 \ninvestments in renewable energy, carbon  reduction, grid resiliency, reliability, and clean  16 \nenergy -enabling technologies in the years ahead. Company Witnesses Jennifer J. Cady 17 \nand Jeffery J. Scissons provide more information on this strategy in their Direct 18 \nTestimony.  19 \n 20 \nThe majority of ALLETE’s capital needs are driven by Minnesota Power. This is 21 \nevidenced by the Company’s forward -looking capital projections . Within the 22 \nCompany’s most recent Capital Structure Petition ,2 the five -year capital expenditure 23 \nprojections for regulated operations were over $4 billion and  accounted for  87 percent 24 \nof the ALLETE Consolidated  capital expenditures .  25 \n 26 \n \n2 In the Matter of the Petition of Minn . Power  Under Minnesota Statutes 216B.49 for Approval  of its Capital \nStructure and Authorization to Issue  Securities , Docket No. E015/S -24-108. \n \n 4 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Q. Why are non -regulated businesses part of the Company’s plans at all ? 1 \nA. While the majority of ALLETE’s capital needs are driven by Minnesota Power, 2 \nALLETE has intentionally structured its mix of businesses to be complementary to each 3 \nother and to ensure flexibility. Due to the required nature of Minnesota Power’s 4 \ninvestments, regulated utility capital needs are prioritized. In contrast, ALLETE’s non - 5 \nutility operations are designed with optionality in mind and to be flexible around their 6 \ncapital needs. A diverse mix of businesses has been beneficial to the overall financial 7 \nhealth of ALLETE over the years and has helped weather difficult economic cycles.  8 \n 9 \nQ. How are Minnesota Power’s capital needs determined?  10 \nA. Regulated utility investments are identified  as part of the Company’s robust resource 11 \nplanning process with input from all stakeholder groups. This process  includes  12 \nMinnesota Power’s Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”)3 and Integrated Distribution Plan 13 \n(“IDP”),4 both approved by the Commission, and regional transmission planning 14 \nprocesses.  15 \n 16 \nQ. What types of projects does Minnesota Power need to construct that require 17 \ncapital in the five - to ten -year horizon?  18 \nA. In an Order dated January  9, 2023, the Commission  approved  Minnesota Power’s  2021 19 \nIRP, which  set forth a path to reducing carbon emissions 80 percent by 2035 and 20 \nincluded significant additions of wind and solar energy generation as well as energy 21 \nstorage  resources . The Company plans to submit its next IRP  by March  1, 2025 , which 22 \nwill address additional resources  necessary to meet the State of Minnesota’s 100 percent 23 \nby 2040 Carbon Free Standard .  These are in addition to transmission investments 24 \nnecessary to achieve these long -term goals, including projects to strengthen or enhance 25 \nthe transmission grid.  Some of these projects were identified as part of the Midwest 26 \nIndependent System Operator, Inc. (“MISO”) long -range transmission planning 27 \nprocess , and require long planning and capital horizons to finance.  28 \n 29 \n \n3 In the Matter of Minn . Power’s 2021 -2035 Integrated Resource Plan , Docket No. E015/M -21-33. \n4 In the Matter of Minn. Power’s 2023 Integrated Distribution Plan , Docket No. E015/M -23-258. \n \n 5 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Additional investments will also be needed for Minnesota Power’s existing facilities to 1 \nmaintain aging infrastructure , in addition to the previously mentioned carbon reduction 2 \ninitiatives . This includes investment in transmission and distribution  projects  to 3 \nmaintain and  expand its system to address reliability and resiliency. Additionally,  4 \ninvestments  are needed  in the generation fleet to meet safety, environmental, regulatory, 5 \nand system reliability objectives.  All of these needs are significantly increasing the 6 \nCompany’s need for capital in the years ahead.  7 \n 8 \nQ. Why are these investments  necessary?  9 \nA. This level of investment is necessary for Minnesota Power to continue to provide the 10 \nsafe, reliable, and affordable electric service that Minnesota Power’s customers expect 11 \nwhile continuing to advance the State of Minnesota’s clean energy goals. Such 12 \nincremental additions in carbon -free generation and transmission infrastructure are 13 \ncritically important when considering the anticipated transition away from coal 14 \ngeneration at Minnesota Power’s last remaining baseload generating facility, Boswell 15 \nEnergy Center, and the around -the-clock requirements from the Company’s large 16 \nindustrial customer base. The Company does not have the ability to delay or defer these 17 \nprojects given the need to ensure compliance with Minnesota’s 2040 Carbon Free 18 \nStandard . 19 \n 20 \nQ. Can you give an example of h ow these levels of regulated capital expenditures  21 \ncompare to historical levels?  22 \nA. Yes.  Over the next five years, ALLETE’s regulated capital plan of over $4 billion 23 \nrepresents a dramatic increase compared to historical investments, which were lower and 24 \nmore manageable from an access -to-capital perspective. The Company’s five -year 25 \ncapital needs represent an approximately 3.8 -times  increase in regulated investment 26 \ncompared to the historical ten -year average, as shown in Figure 1 , below . 27 \n 28 \n \n 6 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Figure 1.  ALLETE Regulated Operations – Historical and Forecasted Capital 1 \nExpenditures5 ($ in millions)  2 \n 3 \n 4 \nQ. Why does Minnesota Power need  to access capital markets for financing?  5 \nA. Company operations alone will not generate sufficient cash flow to fund the capital 6 \ninvestments discussed above . By their nature, regulated utility investments require a 7 \nsignificant amount of upfront capital that is then recovered through rates over the lives 8 \nof the assets.  As a result, utilities rely on capital markets to provide upfront capital . To 9 \ncontextualize , the capital plan for ALLETE’s regulated operations alone represents 131  10 \npercent  of ALLETE’s unaffected market capitalization on December 4, 2023 ,6 which is 11 \nabove its peer group and much higher than historic levels.    12 \n 13 \nPrior to announcing the Acquisition , ALLETE’s investor relations materials disclosed 14 \na need for approximately $1 billion of external equity over the next five years alone to 15 \nfund the over $4 billion  in planned capital expenditures , in addition to significant new 16 \ndebt issuances and refinancing. This level of  equity is needed to maintain the regulated 17 \ncapital structure and credit metrics. I describe the debt and equity markets in more detail 18 \nin Section III.B, below.  19 \n 20 \n \n5 Sourced from Annual Capital Structure Petition filings, Exhibit L.  \n6 December 4, 2023 is the date on which rumors of the Acquisition were published in trade press.  $584 \n$226 \n$122 $177 $210 $232 \n$134 $168 $160 $238 $355 $594 $1,015 $1,201 \n$1,082 \n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024E 2025E 2026E 2027E 2028E\n'14-'23 '24E-'28E Delta (x)\n225$  849 $      3.8xAverageHistorical  Forecasted  \n \n 7 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Q. What challenges would the utility face if it did not have access to sufficient capital 1 \nfor the clean energy transition ahead?  2 \nA. Because ALLETE’s operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to fund its capital 3 \nneeds, the Company would not be able to make the necessary investments to meet the 4 \nState’s Carbon Free  Standard without external capital. Minnesota Power would be 5 \nforced to delay investments that are necessary to continue providing safe, reliable 6 \nservice to customers, at likely higher costs. Even if ALLETE were able to access the 7 \npublic markets at the scale discussed in the Company’s Direct Testimony, the cost of 8 \nsuch access for a Company of ALLETE’s size is difficult to predict and unlikely to be 9 \nreliable, given the ease with which public shareholders can sell stock in small or large 10 \nquantities.  11 \n 12 \nThere are several additional risks from attempting to obtain the quantity of equity 13 \nALLETE will require from public markets. First, the amount of time and resources to 14 \nobtain equity from public markets is material. Public issuances would require sustained 15 \nfocus from ALLETE and Minnesota Power leadership over the coming years, limiting 16 \ntheir ability to attend to other important issues. Additionally, if ALLETE is able to 17 \nobtain public equity financing on the timelines that it requires, the cost of successive 18 \nissuances in a short time period could be significantly higher than historical levels, and 19 \nthereby impact customer rates and credit ratings.  20 \n 21 \nQ. Will ALLETE have difficulty meeting Minnesota Power’s future capital needs if it 22 \nremains publicly traded?  23 \nA. It is highly likely that ALLETE would have difficulty raising the amounts of capital 24 \nMinnesota Power will need in the future without the Acquisition. ALLETE is one of the 25 \nsmallest public utilities in the nation with one of the largest capital programs, relative 26 \nto its size. Additionally, Minnesota Power has a unique risk profile due to the 27 \nconcentration of sales to industrial customers. The size and risk profile of the Company 28 \nrelative to other industry participants and in relation to its ongoing capital needs creates 29 \na unique risk for the Company in terms of access to capital. While ALLETE has been 30 \nable to navigate the risks of public markets in the past, the outsized and ongoing nature 31 \n \n 8 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  of the projected capital needs presents a significant risk that needs to be addressed. The 1 \nproposed acquisition of ALLETE by CPP Investments and GIP (the “ Acquisition ”) is 2 \ncritically important to address this risk.  3 \n 4 \nQ. If regional transmission projects are cost allocated in MISO , why does Minnesota 5 \nPower need to raise capital to construct these projects?  6 \nA. As described a bove, Minnesota Power is making investment s in regionally cost - 7 \nallocated transmission projects. This includes an estimated investment of $650  million 8 \nto $750 million in MISO Tranche 1,7 with additional investments expected in Tranche 9 \n2.8 From a capital -raising perspective, t hese projects function similarly to any other 10 \nregulated utility inves tment . When a project  is cost allocated among all of MISO’s 11 \nparticipants , that simply means that MISO customers will pay their portion of the 12 \nrevenue requirements over the life of the  project . Minnesota Power must still finance 13 \nthe up -front costs of construct ion the regulated utility is supporting . 14 \n 15 \nB. Regulated Utility Financing  16 \nQ. How do publicly  traded utilities raise money for capital needs?  17 \nA. Publicly  traded utilities  generally rely on debt and equity capital to fund the large -scale 18 \ninvestments in utility assets that cannot be covered by internally generated funds . Debt 19 \nand equity investors commit capital  to utilities with the expectation that they will earn 20 \na reasonable return on their investment.  Additionally, utilities can reinvest a portion of 21 \ntheir profits back into the business in the form of retained earnings.  22 \n \n7 In July of 2022, MISO's  Board of Directors unanimously approved  $10.3 billion in new transmission \nprojects.  The Long Range Transmission Planning Tranche 1 Portfolio  is the first of four planned tranches of \ntransmission solutions developed to provide reliable and economic energy delivery to address future reliability \nneeds.  \n8 MISO’s Long Range Transmission Planning  Tranche 2.1  addresses transmission in MISO's Midwest Subregion.  \nAs of September 19, 2024, Tranche 2.1 includes 24 projects totaling $21.8 billion and provides benefits in excess \nof costs.   Planning with stakeholders commenced during the fourth quarter of 2022 and is expected to be finalized \nwith MISO Board of Directors’ approval in December 2024.   \n \n \n 9 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct   1 \nQ. What does it mean when one refers to a utility’s debt financing?  2 \nA. Debt financing refers to a utility borrowing money from an investor for a specified 3 \nperiod of time. The debt investor provides capital to the utility in return for periodic 4 \ninterest payments and the return of capital at the end of the debt security term.  5 \n 6 \nQ. What does it mean when one refers to a utility’s equity financing?  7 \nA. Equity financing is when an investor acquires an ownership interest in a utility. Equity 8 \ninvestors provide capital to the utility with the expectation that they will receive 9 \ndividend payments and an increase in value of their original investment. For a publicly  10 \ntraded utility, an equity investment refers to buying shares of the utility company’s stock 11 \nand taking on the associated risks. For a privately  owned company, an equity investment 12 \nrefers to the ownership interests of the equity investor that is likewise taking on the 13 \nassociated risk of the investment.  14 \n 15 \nQ. What information do investors rely on to make such investments?  16 \nA. Investors rely on a variety of information to determine the level of risk and to analyze a 17 \ncompany’s financial position before making an investment. For equity investors this 18 \nincludes reviewing company financial statements and ratios , assessing the company’s 19 \nhistoric dividends and potential for future growth , understanding industry trends , and 20 \nmaking comparisons to alternative investment options , among other things. Public 21 \nequity investors also rely upon reports from equity research analysts who provide 22 \nfinancial analysis and recommendations of a stock’s value.  23 \n 24 \nDebt investors  also review company financial statements and ratios  to assess  a 25 \ncompany’s financial leverage, risk, and creditworthiness.  Debt investors also rely on 26 \nratings and r eports from  independent  credit rating agencies.  27 \n 28 \nUltimately, all investors rely on assessments of the level of risk associated with their 29 \ninvestment  in determining their expectation for returns . The lower the risk of an 30 \n \n 10 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  investment, the lower the rate of return that is expected . In contrast, the higher the risk 1 \nof an investment, the higher the expected rate of return . 2 \n 3 \nQ. What types of investors are drawn to debt or equity investments?  4 \nA. Debt investors have priority of being paid first in the event an investment experiences  5 \nfinancial difficulties. As such, deb t investments represent a lower risk than equity , and 6 \ndebt investor s expect a lower return.  Therefore, d ebt investors often include insurance 7 \ncompanies and banks , as they are drawn to the  relatively lower risk profile and fixed 8 \ninterest payments.  9 \n 10 \nEquity invest ors, on the other hand , only have a residual claim on the investment’s 11 \nearnings , meaning that equity investments are considered higher risk than debt 12 \ninvestments. As a result, equity investors expect a higher rate of return.  Equity investors 13 \nare drawn to the prospect of regular and increasing dividend payments and stock price 14 \nappreciation but  must  accept the volatility and risk of loss that is associated  with equity 15 \nownership.  Equity investors include institutional investors,  like mutual funds and 16 \npension funds that invest large sums of money in equity , and individual investors who 17 \nbuy shares for their personal investment . 18 \n 19 \nQ. Why do utilities utilize both debt and equity in their capital structure ? 20 \nA. Utilities typically fund their operations using a mix of debt and equity to balance 21 \nfinancial considerations and risk management. Debt financing is generally lower cost 22 \nthan equity due to the lower risk of loss to the investor. While debt capital comes at a 23 \nlower cost, it adds financial risk due to the obligation to make regular interest payments , 24 \nplacing pressure on credit ratings . As a result, utilities seek a balanced capital structure 25 \nthat allows for just and reasonable rates  while maintaining access to capital markets at 26 \ncompetitive rates on behalf of customers.  27 \n \n 11 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct   1 \nQ. What changes are expected under the proposed Acquisition  with respect to debt 2 \nand equity financing ? 3 \nA. The Acquisition primarily  would result in a change in the Company’s equity investors. 4 \nUpon closing of the Acquisition, all outstanding publicly held shares of ALLETE stock  5 \nwill be acquired by the Partners , who will then hold all equity ownership of ALLETE .  6 \n 7 \nNo changes will occur in relation to the Company’s outstanding debt, and ALLETE and 8 \nMinnesota Power will continue to secure debt as needed to fund future projects.  9 \nImportantly, t here will be no changes in the Company’s operations  or assets as a result 10 \nof the Acquisition.   11 \n 12 \n1. Equity Markets  13 \nQ. How do public equity markets function?  14 \nA. Public equity markets function to connect buyers and sellers of equity securities. 15 \nCompanies who are looking to raise capital issue shares to the public through an initial 16 \npublic offering (in the case of a company first becoming listed publicly) or through 17 \nsubsequent follow -on offerings in which additional shares are sold to raise capital. 18 \nUnder this process, the company is selling a portion of the company’s ownership to 19 \ninvestors in exchange for funds. This type of issuance of shares by the company, in 20 \nwhich new shares are being created in exchange for funds, is referred to as a primary 21 \nmarket.  22 \n 23 \nOnce shares have been issued, they can be traded among investors on a stock exchange. 24 \nThis is a centralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can exchange shares. The 25 \nprice at which shares are traded is determined by supply and demand . These exchanges 26 \nare referred to as secondary markets  and investors are buying and selling  shares from 27 \neach other (i.e. , the company whose shares they are trading is not involved in the 28 \ntransaction).  29 \n 30 \n \n 12 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Q. What risks exist in public equity market financing?  1 \nA. There are numerous risks that exist in public equity markets , including many that are 2 \nbeyond a publicly traded company’s ability to control. Among the largest risks is 3 \nuncertainty over the ability to raise the amount of equity needed to fund capital 4 \nexpenditures. This is particularly critical for a public utility with responsibility for 5 \ninvestments needed to reliably deliver an essential service and meet essential public 6 \npolicy obligations. As discussed in Section III.A of my testimony, Minnesota Power’s 7 \ncapital investment requirements going forward will be significant , necessitating access 8 \nto equity capital at the time it is needed, in the amount that is needed, and at a price that 9 \nis reasonable.  10 \n 11 \nAs a small utility with a significant concentration of industrial customers, this presents 12 \na significant challenge to the Company given the scale of equity needs in the future and 13 \nthe volatility of public equity markets. When the Company needs to access equity 14 \nmarkets, it becomes vulnerable to economic cycles, geopolitical events, interest rate 15 \nvolatility, and other influencing factors, and is in direct competition with other publicly 16 \ntraded companies pursuing the same finite pool of investment dollars. The risks of 17 \nequity markets are further discussed in the Direct Testimony of Company and Partner 18 \nWitness John D. Quackenbush .   19 \n 20 \nQ. What is involved in a follow -on equity offering?  21 \nA. In public markets, a follow -on equity offering is a significant undertaking that adds cost, 22 \ncomplexity , and risk to accessing equity capital. This includes working with 23 \nunderwriters, marketing the offering to potential investors who conduct thorough due 24 \ndiligence, and seeking regulatory approvals. Due diligence involves establishing a data 25 \nroom, management presentations , and answering information requests from potential 26 \ninvestors.  Underwriting and other fees add significant cost to such offerings, which 27 \nreduce the proceeds to the company. Additionally, backstop financing is often required 28 \nto ensure funds are available i f the offering is unsuccessful in raising the necessary 29 \nfunds, which adds credit risk. Additional shares  are issued at a discount to the ma rket 30 \nprice and  have a dilutive impact on existing shareholders, which can push the share price 31 \n \n 13 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  down  further . Ultimately, this increases the cost of capital  (and thus customer rates)  and 1 \nadds additional challenges to attracting capital in the future.  This is significant for 2 \nALLETE, given the serial need  for external equity . 3 \n 4 \nQ. What benefits exist in public equity market financing?  5 \nA. Public equity markets are not without benefit. They provide a liquid market for shares 6 \nto be bought and sold and allow companies to seek investments from any parties who 7 \nmay be interested and able to invest. However, for ALLETE, these benefits are 8 \noutweighed by the uncertainties ALLETE faces getting timely, reliable, economic 9 \naccess to public equity as a comparatively very small utility with a higher risk profile 10 \nand unprecedented capital investment requirements going forward.   11 \n 12 \nQ. Do the same  risks exist in a structure like that proposed as part of the Acquisition?  13 \nA. No. The Acquisition would allow Minnesota Power  to more reliably access equity 14 \ncapital  without exposure to the risks described for the public market .  The Acquisition 15 \nremoves the pricing volatility associated with public equity markets as well as 16 \nlimitations on the amounts of equity that can be accessed at any given time due to the 17 \nCompany’s relatively small market capitalization.  18 \n 19 \nIt is important to note that  while  the Acquisition de -risks the Compan y’s access to 20 \ncapital,  the underlying risks of the business remain unchanged . Like other investors, 21 \nprivate infra structure investors , such as the Partners , seek a reasonable return on their 22 \ninvestments and a re asonable opportunity to earn the return authorized by the 23 \nCommissi on. Company and Partner W itness Ann E.  Bulkley p rovides additional 24 \ninformation on the impact o f Commission -approved returns on investment s in her Direct 25 \nTestimony.  26 \n 27 \nQ. What benefits exist in the Acquisition -proposed structure for financing?  28 \nA. In short, the Partners will provide the equity capital that Minnesota Power needs without 29 \nthe risks of obtaining the capital from the public market. The Partners are proposing to 30 \nacquire ALLETE because they are aligned with the Company’s long -term strategy and 31 \n \n 14 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  understand the capital needs associated with that strategy.  This alignment allows the 1 \nCompany to access more reliable financing than exists in public equity markets. The 2 \nPartners not only can provide capital, and do so on a more readily available basis, but 3 \nthey represent more patient capital compared to public equity markets.  4 \n 5 \nQ. What do you mean by “patient capital” when discussing the Acquisition and the 6 \nPartners?  7 \nA. As a publicly traded utility company, ALLETE carries the expectation of regularly 8 \ndistributing dividends to equity holders, which limits ALLETE’s ability to retain 9 \nearnings and represents another burden on the Company’s cash flow. The reference to 10 \nmore patient capital relates to the Partners’ ability to exercise more patience with respect 11 \nto quarterly earnings and dividends due to a focus on long -term returns. Public equity 12 \ninvestors and analysts are often focused on the near term and do not give credit to long - 13 \nterm growth projections or project announcements.  14 \n 15 \nIn contrast, infrastructure and pensions plan investors by nature invest in core 16 \ninfrastructure with long -term horizons with the expectation of sustainable growth and 17 \nreturns over time. Moreover, private equity investments allow for greater flexibility to 18 \nre-invest the capital that would otherwise be returned as dividends to public 19 \nshareholders.  20 \n 21 \nQ. Does access to equity through the Partners impact the Company’s access to debt 22 \ncapital?  23 \nA. Yes. Having reliable access to equity when needed will help support the Company’s 24 \ncredit rating and access to debt capita l. This will allow the Company to maintain its 25 \nregulated capital structure  and credit metrics , which will all ow the Company to access 26 \ndebt capital at a reasonable cost on behalf of customers.  27 \n 28 \n \n 15 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  2. Credit  Rating  1 \nQ. What are credit ratings ? 2 \nA. Credit ratings are the primary measure used by investors to evaluate the risk and 3 \ncreditworthiness of companies . Credit rating agencies make  independent, third -party  4 \nassessments of a compan y’s risk and its ability to meet financial obligations in full and 5 \non time.  Credit rating s are assign ed based on various financial and business risk factors. 6 \nALLETE is rated by two independ ent credit rating agencies: S&P Global Ratings  7 \n(“S&P”) and Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”).  8 \n 9 \nBusiness risk refers to the qualitative assessment made by rating agenc ies and includes 10 \nitems such as customer concentration , regulatory framework , and size.  Financial risk 11 \nrefers to the quantitative assessments made by rating agencies , including financial 12 \nmetrics that measure a company’s ability to cover its interest expense and debt 13 \nrepayments based on the cash flows generated.  14 \n 15 \nQ. Are credit ratings  different for an entity traded on a public stock exchange versus 16 \none owned by a limited number of investors?  17 \nA. No. Credit rating agencies use the same process and methodology to rate public ly traded 18 \nand privately  held companies. As discussed above, ALLETE will continue to secure 19 \ndebt capital as needed to fund a portion of its capital needs. As a result, ALLETE will 20 \ncontinue to maintain its own corporate credit rating  post-closing .   21 \n 22 \nQ. How do credit ratings  impact  a utility’s ability to raise capital?  23 \nA. Credit ratings play a critical role in a u tility’s ability to raise capital. The stronger a 24 \ncompany’s credit rating, the greater the number of investors willing to consider 25 \ninvesting in the company’s debt and the less the company will need to pay in interest 26 \nand fees in order to issue debt  (which in turn reduces the cost of capital to customers).  27 \nAdditionally, because the income available to equity holders is subordinate to debt 28 \nobligations, the weakening of a company’s credit worthiness also increase s the cost of 29 \nequity.  30 \n 31 \n \n 16 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Q. What role do current cost recovery ride rs play in credit ratin g? 1 \nA. Current  cost recovery riders benefit cash flow  and thus credit metrics by providing an 2 \nequity and debt return on the Construction Work in Progress (“CWIP”) during 3 \nconstruction and recovery of revenue requirements between general rate cases. It is 4 \nimportant to note , however, that they are not designed to recover the full up -front capital 5 \ncosts of a project  during construction . The utility must finance the up -front capital costs 6 \nand recover the related revenue requirements over the life of the project  regardless of 7 \nwhether project costs are recovered through a cost recovery rider or rate case.  8 \n 9 \nQ. Has the announcement of the Acquisition had any impact on ALLETE’s credit 10 \nrating?  11 \nA. Upon announcement of the Acquisition, both S&P and Moody’s published updated 12 \ncredit reports on ALLETE affirming ALLETE’s current credit rating. Moody’s report 13 \nincluded its view that the Acquisition was credit neutral and it does not expect material 14 \nchanges in the Company’s credit profile post -closing, reinforcing the fact that 15 \nunderlying risks of the business are unchanged by this Acquisition , while it does address 16 \nthe risk of accessing capital in the future. S&P affirmed its ratings on ALLETE ; 17 \nhowever, consistent with S&P’s  treatment of similar transactions, it did revise its 18 \noutlook from stable to negative based on the possibility that ALLETE’s credit quality 19 \ncould weaken if the post -Acquisition capital structure incorporates a greater level of 20 \ndebt leverage. However, as discussed by Partner Witnesses  Andre w Alley and Jonathan 21 \nBram , this Acquisition will not be heavily leveraged.  Additionally , the Company  and 22 \nthe Partners  made commitments to corporate separateness measures  in the Merger 23 \nAgreement , which is discussed in more detail in the Direct Testimony of  Partner and 24 \nCompany Witness Ellen Lapson and Company Witness Colin B. Anderson . These 25 \nmeasures are  designed to  mitigate risk of negative impact on ALLETE’s credit metrics. 26 \nUltimately, the credit rating agencies will continue to monitor the Acquisition through 27 \nthe regulatory approval process.  28 \n 29 \n \n 17 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Q. If the Acquisition does not close, are there any potential impacts to ALLETE’s 1 \ncredit rating?  2 \nA. Yes. If the Acquisition does not close or is materially delayed , the Company’s credit 3 \nrating could be harmed. As discussed above, there are material risks and challenge s 4 \nassociated with accessing the amount of capital needed to carry out the Company’s 5 \nstrategy . The Acquisition presents an opportunity to mitigate these risks and safeguard 6 \nthe financial health of the Comp any; therefore, the inability to close or a material delay 7 \nwould place the Company in a vulnerable  position.   8 \n 9 \nQ. What might that mean for Minnesota Power?  10 \nA. This could lead to limited or expensive access to capital for Minnesota Power, which 11 \nwould increase the cost and delay the Company’s ability to complete necessary projects 12 \nto address generation, transmission , and distribution system needs.  This would result in 13 \nnegative impacts for all of Minnesota Power’s stakeholders.  14 \n 15 \nC. Effect of the Acquisition  16 \nQ. What assurances do you have that the Partners will be able to provide Minnesota 17 \nPower the access to equity capital it needs?  18 \nA. As discussed in the Direct Testimony of Company Witness Scissons, ALLETE’s 19 \napproach to the Acquisition was designed from the start to identify partners who were 20 \naligned with the Company’s long -term strategy and had the capital necessary to execute 21 \nit. The Partners represent experienced infrastructure investors with a proven track 22 \nrecord. As described in the Petition, CPP Investments has assets under management 23 \ntotaling C AD$632.3 billion , and GIP has approximately $115 billion as of March 31, 24 \n2024. Following the closing of the Acquisition , the Partners will have a vested interest 25 \nin the success of ALLETE, just as they have an interest in the positive performance of 26 \nall their investments; the success of ALLETE, and specifically Minnesota Power and its 27 \ncustomers, is success for the Partners as well. Please see the Direct Testimony provided 28 \nthe Partners  for additional detail on their financial strength and capital commitments.  29 \n 30 \n \n 18 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Q. Are any changes to Minnesota Power’s capital structure proposed as part of the 1 \nAcquisition?  2 \nA. No. As described in the Petition, the Company is proposing to maintain the approved 3 \ncapital structure of Minnesota Power. Minnesota Power will continue to secure external 4 \ndebt to finance a portion of its capital needs and will receive equity infusions from the 5 \nPartners to fund the equity portion of its rate base.  6 \n 7 \nQ. Will the Commission still maintain oversight over Minnesota Power’s capital 8 \nstructure after the Acquisition?  9 \nA. Yes. The Commission will still maintain oversight of Minnesota Power’s capital 10 \nstructure. First, the Commission will continue to determine the appropriate regulated 11 \ncapital structure for Minnesota Power in future rate case proceedings. Additionally, 12 \nMinnesota Power will continue to file annual capital structure petitions with the 13 \nCommission for approval to issue securities, to set the overall common equity ratio, and 14 \ntotal capitalization in which the Company will operate.  15 \n 16 \nQ. Please explain what reporting to the Commission after the Acquisition might look 17 \nlike for Minnesota Power’s capital structure filings?  18 \nA. The Commission will continue to receive similar reporting from ALLETE’s capital 19 \nstructure filings going forward consistent with Minn. Stat. § 216B.49 and Minn. R. 20 \n7825.1000 -7825.1500.  21 \n 22 \nQ. If the Acquisition did not close , what would be the likely result for Minnesota 23 \nPower and its customers?  24 \nA. As discussed above, if the Acquisition  does not close, the Company will be in a 25 \nchallenging position  and will face mat erial risks in accessing the amount of capital 26 \nneeded to serve customers. A failed transaction would be a significant event for the 27 \nCompany and would harm its standing among credit rating agencies and investors . It is 28 \npossible, or even likely, that it could lead to a material negative impact on ALLETE’s 29 \nshare price, which would make it even more challenging to raise equity capital in the 30 \npublic markets.   This would add an additional layer of challenge , on top of the 31 \n \n 19 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTaran Direct  Company’s small size and unique risk profile , as it seeks to attract  an unprecedented  1 \namount of capital investment on an annual basis . This could lead to increased costs and 2 \ndelay s in project execution, which would negatively impact the Company and its 3 \ncustomers. Additionally, the Company would not be in a strong position to serve  4 \nadditional load growth opportunities  in its service territory to the detriment of current 5 \ncustomers and regional stakeholders.  6 \n 7 \nQ. Would a delay in approval of the Acquisition impact the Company?  8 \nA. Yes. As stated in the Merger Agreement , the Partners  have committed to provide  interim 9 \nfinancing  for a period of time. A material delay in regulatory approval would exacerbate  10 \nthe access to capital risks  that face the Company.  A timely approval of the Acquisition 11 \nis critical to  allow the Company to access both debt and equity  at competitive rates  on 12 \nbehalf of customers.  13 \n 14 \nIV. CONCLUSION  15 \nQ. Please summarize your Direct Testimony  for the Commission’s consideration.  16 \nA. ALLETE has significant capital needs, driven primarily by Minnesota Power. Th ese 17 \ncapital needs pose a unique risk to the Company , which  the proposed Acquisition  can 18 \nhelp mitigate . The Acquisition is consistent with the public interest in that it will provide 19 \nthe Company with the capital necessary to continue leading the State of Minnesota in 20 \ntransitioning to a cleaner energy future while maintaining the reliable, safe, and 21 \naffordable service on which Minnesota Power customers depend.  Additionally, the 22 \nAcquisition  will provide the Company access to the capital necessary to meet the State 23 \nof Minnesota’s Carbon Free S tandard.  Finally, the Acquisition is a change in the equity 24 \nownership of ALLETE, which will not cause any adverse impacts on customers, utility 25 \noperations, electric service cost or quality, employees, or communities.  26 \n 27 \nQ. Does this complete your Direct Testimony ? 28 \nA. Yes. 29"

INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ. Please state your name and business address.  2 \nA. My name is Colin B. Anderson, and my business address is 30 West Superior Street, 3 \nDuluth, Minnesota 55802.  4 \n 5 \nQ. By whom are you employed and in what position?  6 \nA. I am employed by ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.1 My current position is 7 \nController  and Vice President  – ALLETE  Rates and Taxes.  8 \n 9 \nQ. Please summarize your qualifications and experience.  10 \nA. I graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Finance from the 11 \nUniversity of Minnesota -Duluth in 2000. I then obtained a Master of Science in 12 \nAccountancy degree from the University of Notre Dame in 2002, and I was an active 13 \nCertified Public Accountant, licensed in Minnesota, for nearly 10 years. I joined 14 \nALLETE as the Controller in 2021, after working in various roles in public accounting 15 \nand the private sector for 20 years. In my current position, I am responsible for 16 \noverseeing the accounting function, including general accounting, property accounting, 17 \naccounts payable, financial reporting, and budgeting ; the tax function  for ALLETE  and 18 \nsubsidiar y companies ; and the rates department  for ALLETE , Inc. d/b/a Minnesota 19 \nPower . 20 \n 21 \nQ. Have you ever testified in any other proceeding?  22 \nA. I provided written direct  testimony in Minnesota Power’s most recent  rate case  before 23 \nthe Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”)  (Docket No. E015/GR -23- 24 \n155) (the “2023 Rate Case”)  but have not testified in person  in a proceeding before the 25 \nCommission . 26 \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Direct Testimony and the \nPetition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically \ndefined, references to “ALLETE” i ndicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota \nPower and all regulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n \n 2 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule   1 \nQ.

Please provide a brief summary of the transaction described in the Petition.  3 \nA. In the Petition, Minnesota Power seeks approval by the Commission of a transaction in 4 \nwhich entities controlled or managed by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board 5 \n(collectively “CPP Investments”) and/or Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”)2 6 \n(together, the “Partners”)  will, through a new Partner -created entity known as Alloy 7 \nParent LLC (“Parent ”), acquire all outstanding shares of ALLETE  (the “Acquisition”). 8 \nThe organizational structure after the Acquisition, as  shown in the diagram on  9 \nAttachment A -2 to the Petition, includes ALLETE, Parent (immediately above 10 \nALLETE), other intermediate entities, and then CPP Investments and GIP.  11 \n 12 \nIII. COST ALLOCATIONS  13 \nQ. Please briefly describe how Minnesota Power fits into ALLETE.  14 \nA. Minnesota Power is a division, not a subsidiary, of ALLETE and comprises the majority 15 \nof ALLETE’s activities. Net income from Minnesota Power regulated operations was 16 \napproximately 60 percent of total consolidated ALLETE net income in 2023, excluding 17 \na non -recurring gain recognized for a favorable arbitration ruling involving a subsidiary 18 \nof ALLETE Clean Energy, and is projected to be 65 percent of total consolidated 19 \nALLETE net income in 2024, excluding merger -related expenses. The remaining 35 20 \npercent of ALLETE’s projected consolidated net income in 2024 comes primarily from 21 \nthe following wholly owned subsidiaries, which are not regulated by the Commission: 22 \nALLETE Clean Energy; BNI Energy; New Energy Equity; Superior Water, Light & 23 \nPower Company; and an investment in the American Transmission Company.  24 \n 25 \n \n2 GIP will control its 60 percent ownership through two funds: Global Infrastructure Partners V (“GIP Fund V”) \nand Tower Bridge Infrastructure Partners, L.P. (“Tower Bridge”).  \n \n 4 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  Q.  Does the Company have procedures in place to ensure accurate cost assignments, 1 \noften referred to as “allocations,” between the regulated activities of Minnesota 2 \nPower and the Company’s non -regulated activities?  3 \nA. Yes. I provided detailed Direct Testimony about these procedures  in the 2023 Rate Case.  4 \n 5 \nQ. Please provide an overview of those procedures.  6 \nA. The starting point is guidance developed by the Commission in Docket No. G,E999/CI - 7 \n90-1008. In that docket, the Commission identified four principles for ensuring cost 8 \nseparation between regulated and non -regulated activities:  9 \n• Tariffed rates shall be used to value tariffed services provided to the non - 10 \nregulated activity;  11 \n• Costs shall be directly assigned to either regulated or non -regulated activities 12 \nwhenever possible;  13 \n• Costs that cannot be directly assigned are common costs, which shall be grouped 14 \ninto homogeneous cost categories. Each cost category shall be allocated based 15 \non direct analysis of the origin of the costs whenever possible. If direct analysis 16 \nis not possible, common costs shall be allocated based upon an indirect cost - 17 \ncausative linkage to another cost category or group of cost categories for which 18 \ndirect assignment or allocation is available; and  19 \n• When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost causation can be found, the 20 \ncost category shall be allocated based upon a general allocator computed by 21 \nusing the ratio of all expenses directly assigned or attributed to regulated and 22 \nnon-regulated activities, excluding the cost of fuel, gas, purchased power, and 23 \nthe cost of purchased goods sold.3 24 \n 25 \nQ. How does the Company implement this guidance?  26 \nA. First, the Company directly assigns costs whenever possible. Approximately 90 percent 27 \nof Minnesota Power’s 2023 regulated and non -regulated O&M expenses were directly 28 \n \n3 In re Investigation into the Competitive Impact of Appliance Sales and Service Practices of Minn. Gas and Elec. \nUtils. , Docket No. G,E999/CI -90-1008, ORDER SETTING FILING REQUIREMENTS  at 5, 7 (Sept 28, 1994) (clarified \nby ORDER CLARIFYING COMM ’N ORDER DATED SEPT. 28, 1994  at 2 (Mar. 7, 1995)).  \n \n 5 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  assigned. The process by which this is done is described in detail in my Direct 1 \nTestimony in the 2023 Rate Case.  2 \n 3 \nThe remaining approximately 10 percent of expenses cannot be directly assigned. These 4 \nexpenses are mostly for general and administrative support activities that benefit all 5 \nentities in the ALLETE consolidated group. To allocate such costs, a cost pool is created 6 \nfor each similar type of administrative and general activity. Expenses within each cost 7 \npool are then allocated utilizing an allocation method specifically designed for that 8 \nactivity. There are 29 different Allocation Methods currently being utilized by the 9 \nCompany.4 The allocators are specific in nature and include factors such as number of 10 \nemployees, fixed asset balances, corporate equity, number of plan participants, and 11 \nnumber of desktop and laptop computers. Again, more detail about the allocation 12 \nprocess is provided in the 2023 Rate Case.  13 \n 14 \nThe objective of the cost allocation process is to allocate general and administrative 15 \ncosts in a reasonable, prudent, and fair manner that correlates the benefit each activity 16 \nprovides to the Company’s regulated versus non -regulated and subsidiary activities. 17 \nThus, there are no general or default allocations, nor default assumptions as to whether 18 \ncosts should be allocated to regulated, non -regulated, or subsidiary activities.  19 \n 20 \nQ. Please provide more detail about the corporate equity allocator mentioned in your 21 \nprevious answer.  22 \nA. There are certain areas of costs, such as Board of Directors expenses and Audit Services 23 \ncosts, that are allocated using a corporate equity allocator. The corporate equity allocator 24 \nis appropriate for such cost areas because it aligns the expenses incurred with the value 25 \nof each entity, rather than the level of expenditures at each entity, which is neither 26 \n \n4 See In the Matter of the Petition of Minn.

In addition, the corporate equity allocator 1 \nis not subject to annual swings in expenditure levels. The Company has undertaken a 2 \ncomparison of allocation methods which shows that customers are helped, not harmed, 3 \nby Minnesota Power’s use of the corporate equity allocator. This is described in more 4 \ndetail in my testimony in the 2023 Rate Case.  5 \n 6 \n In addition, there are also some cost areas, such as Strategic Planning, Financial 7 \nPlanning, Tax Services, Financial Reporting, Finance Services, External 8 \nCommunications, Legal Services, and General Accounting Services, that are allocated 9 \nbased on combinations of corporate equity and fixed asset balances. Costs within these 10 \nareas are directly assigned when possible. However, not all charges in these areas can 11 \nbe directly assigned, because such costs are incurred routinely for the benefit of all or 12 \nmultiple areas of ALLETE.    13 \n 14 \nQ. Have Minnesota Power’s cost allocation methods changed materially since the 15 \n2023 Rate Case?  16 \nA. No, but there have been updates to adjust the allocation percentages between regulated, 17 \nnon-regulated, and subsidiary activities, as the amount of ALLETE’s regulated and non - 18 \nregulated activity has ebbed and flowed. Information about these changes is provided 19 \nin annual Compliance Filings in Docket No. E015/M -01-1416; the most recent was 20 \nsubmitted in May 2024 (the “2024 Compliance Filing”).  21 \n 22 \nQ. Does the Company provide evidence to the Commission that there is no cross - 23 \nsubsidization by Minnesota Power’s customers of the activities of its affiliated 24 \ncompanies?  25 \nA. Yes. The allocation process , which has been provided to the Commission for review  in 26 \nother dockets , ensures that there are no cross -subsidies between Minnesota Power 27 \ncustomers and the costs related to ALLETE’s non -regulated companies.5 28 \n \n5 See In the Matter of Minn.

Will the allocation process change for ALLETE or Minnesota Power after the 2 \nAcquisition if it is approved by the Commission?  3 \nA. No, the allocation process will not change. This is to be expected, because as explained 4 \nin the Petition, the Acquisition will not result in any change to the companies within the 5 \nALLETE family or in any changes to the arrangements, contracts, and agreements 6 \nwithin that family  (except that a n updated tax sharing agreement will be completed) .  7 \nIrrespective of the Acquisition, there will continue to be regular updates to allocation 8 \npercentages between regulated, non -regulated, and subsidiary activities as discussed 9 \nabove.  10 \n 11 \nQ. Will the corporate equity allocator need to be updated due to the Acquisition?  12 \nA. No. Minnesota Power does not anticipate that the corporate equity allocator will need 13 \nto be updated due to the Acquisition.  14 \n 15 \nIV. AFFILIATED INTERESTS  16 \nA. Affiliated Interest Filings  17 \nQ. Please describe Minnesota Power’s affiliated interest filings.  18 \nA. Minnesota law requires public utilities to seek approval from the Commission for 19 \ncontracts  exceeding $50,000  between the utility and an affiliated interest. Minnesota 20 \nPower  has filed with the Commission affiliated interest agreements  and tax sharing 21 \nagreements  between it and subsidiaries of ALLETE . Also,  Minnesota Power has 22 \nannually filed with the Commission an Affiliated Interest Annual Report (“Annual 23 \nAffiliate  Report”) pursuant to Minn. Rule 7825.2200(A) and Commission Orders dated 24 \nJanuary 13, 2009 in Docket Nos. E015/AI -08-339, E015/AI -08-341, and E015/AI -08- 25 \n340. The Annual Affiliate Report lists all shareholders that own greater than five percent  26 \nof the outstanding shares of ALLETE ’s stock . The Annual Affiliate Report also include s 27 \n \nBetween ALLETE, Inc. and its Subsidiary, Superior Water, Light and Power Co.

By 2 \nmaking th ese filings, the Company  has complie d with the Commission’s historical 3 \napplication of Minnesota’s affiliated interest law.  4 \n 5 \nQ. What is the purpose of these filings?  6 \nA. As I understand it, the essential purpose of Minnesota’s affiliated interest law  and the 7 \nCompany’s affiliated interest filings made with the Commission is to allow the 8 \nCommission to ensure that agreements among affiliated companies are reasonable and 9 \nto identify potential self -dealing that could harm customers.  Therefore , the affiliated 10 \ninterest statute should be interpreted and applied consistent with the Commission’s core 11 \nresponsibility to establish just and reasonable rates.  12 \n 13 \nQ.  What kinds of companies have been identified in past Annual Affiliate Reports as 14 \nowning more than five percent  of the outstanding shares of ALLETE’s stock?  15 \nA. The shareholders owning greater than five percent  of ALLETE ’s outstanding shares  16 \nhave generally been institu tional investors such as BlackRock , Inc. (“BlackRock”)  and 17 \nThe Vanguard  Group, Inc. (“Vanguard”) . Institutional investors  like BlackRock and 18 \nVanguard  typically  own stock in hundreds or thousands of individual companies.  19 \n 20 \nQ. What information, relating to institutional investors, was in Minnesota Power’s 21 \nmost recent Annual Affiliate Report?  22 \nA. Minnesota Power’s most recent affiliated interest filing, filed on April 1, 2024, 23 \nidentified two companies that owned more than five percent of its outstanding shares: 24 \nBlackRock or companies it controls held 7,691,035 shares, about 13.36 percent of the 25 \nCompany’s shares; and Vanguard held 6,589,998 shares, about 11.45 percent of the 26 \nCompany’s shares.  27 \n 28 \n \n 9 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  Q. Has the Commission  considered other  businesses in which such institutional 1 \ninvestors own interests  as affiliates ? 2 \nA. No. The Commission  has not historically treated  other businesses  in which such 3 \ninstitutional investors own similar  interests  as requiring data or filings in Minnesota 4 \nPower  affiliated interest filings . This treatment  has been  consistent ly applied by the 5 \nCommission in sim ilar instances with other utilities.   6 \n 7 \nQ. Is the Commission’s historical approach reasonable ? 8 \nA. Yes. The approach taken to date by the Commission provides enough information to 9 \nallow stakeholders to analyze affiliated interest issues and to protect against self - 10 \ndealing.  It recognizes that institutional investors are investors, not operators of public 11 \nutilities.  Changing the Commission’s historical approach would turn innumerable 12 \ncompanies owned by institutional investors  into affiliates of each Minnesota public 13 \nutility, without regard for their role as investors , not operators.  This would be entirely 14 \nunworkable —both for the Commission and for the utilities the Commission regulates. 15 \nFurther, c hanging the Commission’s historical approach  is not necessary to achieve the 16 \npurpose of the affiliated interest requirements , because  it would not protect against 17 \naffiliate self -dealing and would  not advance  the Commission’s core purpose  of 18 \nestablishing  just and reasonable rates . 19 \n  20 \nQ. How should  the Commission consider affiliated interest requirements in the 21 \ncontext of  the Acquisition?  22 \nA. The Commission should take a reasonable and flexible view of affiliated interest 23 \nrequirements, consistent with its historical approach. A reasonable application of 24 \naffiliated interest requirements is necessary in a modern marketplace where investments 25 \nof the size and scope needed by a public utility are regularly made through multi -tiered 26 \ninvestment structures and by large institutional investors that have investments in , 27 \nwithout direct control over,  many other businesses. The affiliated interest statute will 28 \nremain  an effective tool to protect the public from harm that may result from self -dealing 29 \namong related companies . But it does not follow that affiliated interest scrutiny needs 30 \nto apply where th ere is a lack of direct control over the contracting company or 31 \n \n 10 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  companies, whether it be the utility or its counterparties. Put another way, if there is not 1 \nan ability on the part of an investor to directly control or influence the contracting 2 \ndecisions of an entity, that entity’s contracts will be entered into at arms -length relative 3 \nto other interests of the investor, and the concerns of self -dealing are not present.  4 \n 5 \nQ.  Will there be any change to Minnesota Power’s existing affiliated interest  6 \nagreement s as a result of the Acquisition?  7 \nA. No, except with respect to a new tax sharing agreement . There are several reasons why 8 \nthere  will be no changes other than the new tax sharing agreement . First, the companies 9 \nwithin the ALLETE family will not change as a result of the Acquisition, and the 10 \nAcquisition will not result in any changes to the arrangements, contracts, and 11 \nagreements within that family  of businesses . Second, nothing about the Acquisition 12 \nrequires the Company to enter into new affiliate interest agreements, except for the 13 \npreviously -mentioned new tax sharing agreement . That new tax sharing agreement is 14 \nnecessary because a  new consolidated group for tax purposes will come into being on 15 \nthe day of the closing . The new tax sharing agreement will define the roles, 16 \nresponsibilities, and tax treatment within the consolidated group  and the Company will  17 \nfile that agreement within 30 days of its execution. Third, t he companies that are 18 \nacquiring ALLETE, entities controlled or managed by the Partners , are not currently 19 \naffiliated interests of ALLETE. ALLETE and the Partners have undertaken reasonable 20 \ndiligence and have not identified any material contracts between ALLETE and its 21 \naffiliates and CPP Investments or GIP  and therefore , no additional affiliated interest 22 \nagreements  are expected  upon closing of the transaction .  23 \n 24 \n Q. Please describe how the Company will manage affiliate interest reporting after the 25 \nacquisition.  26 \nA. Post acquisition, the Company will continue to file all affiliated interest and tax sharing 27 \nagreements, as applicable. The Company will also continue to file its Annual Affiliate 28 \nReport. The Annual Affiliate Report will continue to comply with the historical 29 \napplication of the affiliate interest statute and will include: the affiliate listing; the cost 30 \nallocation methodology; the total allocated and direct costs associated with ALLETE’s 31 \n \n 11 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  subsidiaries; and all agreements greater than $50,000 associated with the affiliates 1 \nidentified in the Report.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Will Minnesota Power continue to identify all subsidiaries of ALLETE in the 4 \nAnnual Affiliate Report?  5 \nA. Yes, consistent with its current process Minnesota Power will continue to identify all 6 \nsubsidiaries of ALLETE post -Acquisition.  7 \n 8 \nQ. Post Acquisition, how will Minnesota Power identify CPP  Investments  and GIP on 9 \nthe Annual Affiliate Report?  10 \nA. Minnesota Power will identify all entities directly up the chain of ALLETE corporate 11 \nownership, from Parent up to and including CPP Investments and Global Infrastructure 12 \nManagement, LLC.  13 \n 14 \nQ. Will Minnesota Power continue to identify BlackRock as an affiliated interest in 15 \nthe Annual Affiliate Report?  16 \nA. Yes. Minnesota Power will identify affiliation with BlackRock in the same way that it 17 \nis currently reported.  I note that as the Acquisition closes, BlackRock will effectively 18 \nbe selling its currently owned shares of ALLETE stock to the Partners, the same as other 19 \ncurrent ALLETE shareholders. BlackRock will no longer directly own voting shares of 20 \nALLETE.  21 \n 22 \nQ. Why is Minnesota Power taking this approach?  23 \nA. This approach is a reasonable application of Minnesota’s affiliated interest statute that 24 \nis consistent with the Commission’s past practice  of interpreting and applying the statute 25 \nin a practic al manner . Minnesota Power will focus its additional reporting on the 26 \nPartners, and continue to report BlackRock as an affiliate in the same way that it has 27 \nbeen reported for years.6  This approach can be implemented in a way that enables the 28 \n \n6 As Commission Staff noted in the September 19, 2024 briefing papers in this proceeding : “It is unlikely that \nthere are a significant number of large or medium -sized publicly traded companies in the United States that \nVanguard and/or BlackRock don’t own 5% or more of  . . . . Given the nature of Vanguard and BlackRock, it is \n \n \n 12 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  Commission to carry out its responsibility to ensure just and reasonable rates without 1 \nincurring additional, unworkable burdens that would paralyze regulatory and 2 \noperational processes. Thus, this approach can further the public interest in an efficient 3 \nregulatory process while still providing protection for the interests of Minnesotans.  4 \n 5 \nQ. Will the Company take other steps to ensure fair dealing among affiliated entities?  6 \nA. Yes. Minnesota Power continues to hold integrity and  fair dealing among its core values 7 \nand would not have entered into this transaction with these Partners if they did not share 8 \nthose values.  Further, the purpose of affiliated interest requirements, as I understand it, 9 \nis to identify those relationships that would actually have a bearing on costs to 10 \ncustomers. The Company also understands, however, that integrity must be 11 \ndemonstrated. To that end,  as described in the next section of my testimony , Minnesota 12 \nPower’s robust procurement protocols will be  augmented , there by ensuring arm’s length 13 \ntransactions and fair outcomes for Minnesota Power customers and other stakeholders. 14 \nThese filings and protocols will give the Commission and other stakeholders  ample 15 \nassurance that Minnesota Power will continue to act in the best interests of consumers . 16 \n 17 \nB. Procurement  18 \nQ. What is Minnesota Power’s process for procuring goods and services from affiliate 19 \ncompanies?  20 \nA. The Company’s Purchasing Manual (attached as Schedule 1) governs its processes for 21 \nprocuring goods and services.  Chapter 4 – Ethics of the Purchasing Manual includes 22 \nrequirements  for related par ty transactions that protect against unfair or otherwise 23 \ninappropriate dealings : contracts involving related parties must be  competitively quoted  24 \nwhere two or more vendors provide pricing and a scope of work and/or technical 25 \nspecificat ions (see Chapter 7 – Quoting Policy) , must receive management approval, 26 \nand must meet all requirements relating to the purchase order process  to ensure the 27 \npurchase is providing appropriate  value to customers . The Purchasing Manual also 28 \n \nlikely that virtually every contract that many, if not all our investor owned -utilities undertake with a publicly traded \ncorporation – and some privately held businesses – would become ‘affiliated interest’ contracts under the \ninterpretation used by the De partment.”  \n \n 13 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  includes requirements relating to  supplier guidelines, quoting/bidding policies, approval 1 \nlevels, change orders, and other topics , all of which assist with ensuring that any 2 \nprocurements involving  affiliated companies are fair and reasonable.  3 \n 4 \nIn addition, Company policies require competitive bidding where possible, and limit 5 \nsole sourcing of projects to specific  instances , such as  when it is necessary to contract 6 \nwith the  original equipment manufacturer (OEM)  or when only one vendor can meet 7 \nthe required  scope and/or technical specifications . All sole source purchases require a 8 \nwritten  justification and must follow  the required approval  process.  When they are 9 \napplicable , Request for Proposal (“RFP”) processes further protect customers by 10 \nhelping ensure multiple possible options  are considered , including supplies and 11 \ntransaction partners, which  gives the Company additional insight into market pricing. 12 \nFurther, the Company has a robust RFP process related to affiliates bidding on resource  13 \nprojects. This process is described in the Direct Testimony of Company Witness  Cady.   14 \n 15 \nQ. Has Minnesota Power developed a p rocess by which it will  identify transactions 16 \nthat are subject to affiliated interest protocols after the Acquisition has closed?  17 \nA. Yes. Going forward, Minnesota Power will create a new field in its Enterprise Resource 18 \nPlanning (“ERP”) system, Oracle, to track GIP and CPP  Investments  entities identified 19 \nin the Annual Affiliate Report.  Table 1, below, identifies the entities that, a s of the 20 \npreparation of this testimony, would  be identified in the Company’s system:  21 \n \n 14 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  Table 1   1 \n 2 \nAnnually, the Company will update the affiliate field in the supplier record as necessary.  3 \n 4 \nTracking Partner affiliate interest transactions in this way will ensure  the Company 5 \nfollow s the existing Related -party transaction process in the Purchasing Manual, 6 \nconduct transactions at arms -length, and comply with reporting requirements. Tracking 7 \naffiliates in Oracle using the method described above will also allow reports to be 8 \ngenerated to view all affiliate transactions. Additionally, t his process is a reasonable 9 \napproach to identifying and managing meaningful affiliate interest relationships – that 10 \nis, those transactions between Minnesota Power and an entity that is both within the 11 \ncontrol of a Partner and within the chain of ownership between ALLETE and a Partner.   12 \n 13 GIP Entities  CPP Investments Entities  Alloy Entities  \nGlobal Infrastructure \nManagement, LLC  Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board  Alloy Holdings LP  \nGlobal Infrastructure \nInvestors V, LLC  CPP Investment Board \nPrivate Holdings (5), Inc.

How else will Minnesota Power ensure fair and competitive procurement practices 1 \npost-acquisition?  2 \nA. Minnesota Power  will continue to follow its Purchasing Manual. The Purchasing 3 \nManual outlines policies, guidelines and requirements for all purchases  with the goal of 4 \nlowering costs while obtaining the best value for the company and customer  in an ethical 5 \nand fair manner . For example , Chapter 4 – Ethics addresses R elated Party Transactions ; 6 \nChapter 5 – Supplier Guidelines addresses Supplier obligations to the Company and 7 \nCompany o bligations to the Supplier ; Chapter 6 – Approval Levels addresses the 8 \nrequired approval levels for contracts;  and Chapter 7 – Quoting Policy of the Purchasing 9 \nManual  states , “As a regulated utility, Minnesota Power is required to obtain 10 \ncompetitive quotations or provide a single source/justification letter explaining why we 11 \ndid not get competitive quotes on all purchases of materials and services over $50,000. ” 12 \nThe only change to our robust procurement process will be the change to our list of 13 \naffiliates. All transactions with affiliates , regardless of the dollar  amount,  will continue 14 \nto be  subject to the Quoting Policy , and added level of management approval , and 15 \nconflict of interest reporting, if applicable.   16 \n 17 \nMinnesota Power will continue to ensure all relevant  employees are trained in these 18 \nprocedures. Any employee requesting access to the ERP (Oracle) system must take a 19 \nrequired trainin g and pass a short quiz which includes key points  from the Purchasing 20 \nManual , such as  the competitive bidding requirements, approval levels , contract signing 21 \nauthority and ethics . While each employee has an obligation to the company to engage 22 \nin fair business dealings, the Supply Chain/Purchasing Department serves a supervisory 23 \nrole, ensur ing that  purchasing policies are adhered to.  Every few years, these processes  24 \nare audited by our Internal Audit Department  to ensure compliance.  In addition, 25 \nMinnesota Power will continue to follow the established RFP process for competitive 26 \nbidding of large projects, mentioned above. If , while adhering to these policies,  27 \nMinnesota Power enters into an agreement with a company that is an affiliated interest, 28 \nthat agreement would be filed with the Commission consistent with Minnesota’s 29 \naffiliated interest filing requirements . The Company is open to discussions with the 30 \n \n 16 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  Commission in regard to  potential new controls that would create  a higher degree of 1 \nconfidence around our procurement process with affiliate interest s. 2 \n 3 \nQ. Does Minnesota Power also have a Supplier Code of Conduct?  4 \nA. Yes.  The Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct is shared with all vendors and is part 5 \nof the supplier onboarding process which  helps create a more ethical, compliant, and 6 \nsustainable supply chain, benefiting both the Company and its suppliers  and ensures that 7 \nwe are working with the right vendors in an effort  to provide the best value to our 8 \ncustomers . The supplier code of conduct is a valuable tool for several reasons:  9 \n1. Promotes Ethical Behavior : It sets clear expectations for suppliers regarding 10 \nethical standards, such as fair labor practices, environmental responsibility, and 11 \nanti-corruption measures.  12 \n2. Ensures Compliance : It helps ensure that suppliers comply with laws and 13 \nregulations, reducing the risk of legal issues and penalties.  14 \n3. Protects Reputation : By holding suppliers to high ethical standards, companies 15 \ncan protect and enhance their reputation.  16 \n4. Builds Trust : A clear code of conduct builds trust between the company and its 17 \nsuppliers, fostering long -term, sustainable relationships.  18 \n5. Mitigates Risk : It helps identify and mitigate potential risks in the supply chain, 19 \nsuch as labor violations or environmental harm.  20 \n6. Encourages Improvement : It encourages suppliers to continuously improve 21 \ntheir practices, aligning with the company's commitment to social responsibility.  22 \n7. Ensures Consistency : It provides a consistent framework for evaluating and 23 \nmanaging suppliers, ensuring fairness and transparency.  24 \nQ. What are the relevant requirements of the Supplier Code of Conduct?  25 \nA. Suppliers are given a copy of the Supplier Code of conduct and are asked to adhere to 26 \nit. The document outlines  the Company ’s values:  Integrity, Safety, People and Planet . 27 \nThe Company  expects its business partners, including all contractors, vendors, and 28 \nsuppliers of goods and services and their employees, agents, and subcontractors, to 29 \nembody these values and to act ethically and with integrity, in accordance with 30 \nALLETE’s Code of Business Conduct. Th e Supplier Code of Conduct outlines 31 \nALLETE’s expectations, and any failure to comply with these minimum requirements 32 \nmay jeopardize a Supplier’s relationship with ALLETE.  The Company uses the 33 \nSupplier Code of Conduct for all vendors, including affiliates, as a reminder  of our core 34 \nvalue s and we believe this , along  with the addition of the ownership question on the 35 \n \n 17 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  Vendor form , will assist us in ensuring  transactions are  executed  in the best interest of 1 \nthe Company and rate payers.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Does the Company have any other policies or procedures t hat underscore its 4 \nongoing commitment to fair dealing?  5 \nA. Yes.  Minnesota Power also has a C ode of Business Conduct that focuses on integrity , 6 \nwhich is one of the Company ’s core values. Each employee must take  annual required 7 \ntraining relating to  ethics, integrity and the Code of Business Conduc t. The Code of 8 \nBusiness Conduct  has a large section devoted to “Our Business Practices” and covers 9 \nthings like compliance, financial integrity, fair competition, fair dealing, conflicts of 10 \ninterest, business gifts and environmental stewardship.  The section on Fair Dealing 11 \nreads : “We deal fairly with our customers, suppliers and competitors. It is wrong to take 12 \nunfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged 13 \ninformation, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair -dealing practice. 14 \nFailing to deal fairly with others could damage our reputation and the company’s 15 \nreputation. It also could be illegal. ALLETE’s reputation is a reflection of how we treat 16 \nothers.”  Minnesota Power’s Purchasing Manual was developed with the Code of 17 \nBusiness Conduct as its foundation . In addition, our suppliers are given a copy of our 18 \nCode of Business Conduct when they are onboarded and many contracts with our 19 \nsuppliers either refer to or require compliance with the Code of Busines s Conduct.    20 \n 21 \nQ. What do you conclude regarding customer affiliate interest protections as a result 22 \nof the Acquisition?  23 \nA. We have strong policies in place like our Procurement Manual, Code of Business 24 \nConduct , and Supplier Code of Conduct , as well as a team dedicated to communicating 25 \nthese policies, enforcing them and executing  all purchase orders  that govern 26 \nprocurement transactions including  those with affiliate s. We work with integrity every  27 \nday and the Acquisition  will not change that. We will have the same management  team 28 \nmaking the day-to-day decisions  after the Acquisition,  and will continue to choose all 29 \nvendors based on  the value they create for our customers . We also believe our process 30 \nfor identify ing and reporting affiliates through  the Partner entities that will have 31 \n \n 18 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  ownership in ALLETE is a reasonable approach to provide transparency and assurance  1 \nagainst potential self -dealing.  2 \n 3 \nV.

Have Minnesota Power and the Partners made “ring -fencing” commitments 6 \nrelating to corporate separateness and financing?  7 \nA. Yes. Ring -fencing is a term that is used to describe arrangements that keep a regulated 8 \nutility business separate from the non -utility affiliates or holding company parent of the 9 \nutility. In the context of the Acquisition, ring -fencing refers to measures and 10 \ncommitments undertaken by ALLETE and the Partners that are intended to protect the 11 \nregulated utility and its customers from non -regulated risks and expenditures, as well as 12 \nthe business and financial risks of the Partners. The “ring -fencing” commitments made 13 \nby Minnesota Power and the Partners are outlined starting on page 20 of the Petition. 14 \nWe believe these commitments demonstrate that Minnesota Power and its customers 15 \nwill be adequately and appropriately protected and separated from non -regulated risks.  16 \n 17 \nQ. Will the financial accounts of Alloy Parent and ALLETE be commingled?  18 \nA. No. The Alloy Parent entity will have its own accounts and will not be shared with 19 \nALLETE’s financial accounts. This separation is crucial to maintaining  the separateness 20 \nof the two entities.  21 \n 22 \nQ. How will Alloy Parent LLC be financed by the Partners?  23 \nA. The Partners will purchase all the outstanding shares of ALLETE , Inc.  with 24 \napproximately $ 300 million  in debt and $3.6 billion  (cash) equity.  25 \n 26 \nQ. Will there be debt at Alloy Parent LLC?  27 \nA. Yes, Alloy Parent LLC has received commitments for a $600 million term loan, only 28 \n$300 million of which is expected to be drawn at close in connection with the 29 \nacquisition, with the balance available to fund future capital projects of the Company  30 \nafter the acquisition closes. Alloy Parent has also received a commitment for  a $100 31 \n \n 19 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  million revolving credit facility for use after the acquisition closes to assist in supporting 1 \nfuture capital needs of the Company . The Company will not be an obligor on the term 2 \nloan or revolver , and therefore it is non -recourse to  ALL ETE and/or Minnesota Power .  3 \n 4 \nQ. Can the Partners borrow against any of Minnesota Power’s assets for financing 5 \nuses other than by Minnesota Power?  6 \nA. No. Similar to  our current financing policy , Minnesota Power assets will only be used 7 \nas collateral for first mortgage bonds issued by Minnesota Power. As explained in the 8 \nPetition, Minnesota Power and the Partners have  commi tted that the Partners are 9 \nprohibit ed from making loans to or pledging the assets of ALLETE without Minnesota 10 \nPower obtaining regulatory approval. This is  also documented in the Merger Agreement 11 \nat Section 6.06 (b)(iv) , in which the parties commit to a number of separateness 12 \nconditions identified in a Company Disclosure Letter . 13 \n 14 \nQ. How will the Commission be able to confirm that Minnesota Power’s assets are not 15 \nbeing used for financing uses other than by Minnesota Power?  16 \nA. Each year, Minnesota Power is required to file with the Commission a Petition  for 17 \nApproval  of its Capital Structure and Permission to Issue Securities . That P etition 18 \ndescribes  Minnesota Power’s 18-month financing plan  and requests approval of the 19 \nidentified financing over that period . The Commission’s orders in Minnesota Power ’s 20 \nannual capital structure petition docket s have included the following reoccurring 21 \nrequirement: Within 20 days after a securities issuance, Minnesota Power must file 22 \ndetails on the specific purposes of the individual issuances, the type, timing, amounts, 23 \ncost of issuance (including price per share for common equity issuances), and interest 24 \nrates. Minnesota Power  will continue to comply with th ese filing requirements . 25 \n 26 \nQ.  Can ALLETE provide a guarantee for Alloy Parent credit facilities?  27 \nA.  No. ALLETE and the Partners pledged in the Petition tha t neither ALLETE nor Parent 28 \nshall provide direct credit support to a credit facility of the other through a guarantee , 29 \nand also none of ALLETE’s credit facilities will include a cross -default provision 30 \nwhereby a default under any of Parent’s credit facilities would cause a default under any 31 \n \n 20 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  of ALLETE’s credit facilities. This is one of the separateness requirements established 1 \nin the Merger Agreement as well.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Is there a risk that ALLETE  is exposed to any  business and financial risk exposures 4 \nrelated to Alloy Parent LLC  or the Partners ? 5 \nA. No. The Partners have pledged to hold ALLETE harmless from such exposures. In 6 \naddition, the Partners and ALLETE committed in the Petition that in the event of a 7 \nbankruptcy of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (other than ALLETE and its 8 \nsubsidiaries), a bankruptcy court will not consolidate the assets and liabilities of 9 \nALLETE with Parent or any Parent entity .  10 \n 11 \nQ.  How can regu lators get assurance that Minnesota Power will be held harmless 12 \nfrom any busin ess and financial exposures associated with  Alloy Parent LLC , the 13 \nPartners , or its affiliates?  14 \nA.  ALLETE will maintain its own corporate and debt credit rating and it s own ratings for 15 \nlong-term debt, separate from Alloy Parent LLC.  ALLETE and Alloy Parent LLC will 16 \neach obtain a  separate  annual audited financial statement  and Minnesota Power will 17 \ncontinue  to comply with  annual corporate structure  petition and compliance filings . 18 \nALLETE will provide regulators with appropriate access to ALLETE’s books and 19 \nrecords ; appropriate access to ALLETE’s financial information and filings; access to 20 \nand audit rights with respect to  the documents supporting Parent’s costs  that may be 21 \nallocated to  ALLETE ; and appropriate access to ALLETE’s board minutes, audit 22 \nreports , and information provided to or by credit rating agencies pertaining to ALLETE.  23 \n 24 \nQ. How will financing procedures between Parent and Minnesota Power  work  after 25 \nthe Acquisition ? 26 \nA. Financing at Minnesota Power will function similarly to our current procedures.  The 27 \nMinnesota Power team will identify projects and investment opportunities that align 28 \nwith the Company’s mission of providing  safe, reliable, and affordable power to 29 \ncustomers, while striving to meet all clean energy requirements.  30 \n 31 \n \n 21 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  Q. How will costs such as interest and financing expense  be treated  post-Acquisition 1 \nbetween and among Alloy Parent  LLC  and the Company  ? 2 \nA. At the ALLETE level, nothing in the process will change. Interest and financing costs 3 \nwill continue to be apportio ned between Minnesota Power and the other parts of 4 \nALLETE using the same allocation process  that is current ly used. Minnesota Power  will 5 \ncontinue to issue first mortgage bonds  to finance  the projects that will be included  in 6 \nMinnesota jurisdictional  rates . ALLETE will continue to issue additional  debt, as 7 \nneeded, for its non-regulated businesses ; such debt  will be excluded from Minnesota 8 \njurisdictional expenses for rate making purposes , as it currently is .  9 \n 10 \n All interest and financing costs incurred by issuing debt at the Alloy Parent LLC  level 11 \nwill remain at that level and will not be pushed down to ALLETE.  It is not our current 12 \nintention to have Alloy Parent LLC  issue debt to ALLETE , but if  that is  contemplated  13 \nin the future , it would require regulatory approval . For FERC reporting purposes, we 14 \nwill continue to report all debt incurred  at the ALLETE level , but we will exclude from 15 \nMinnesota Power’s jurisdictional rates any financing costs or additional interest expense  16 \nrelated to the acquisition or Alloy Parent LLC.  17 \n 18 \nQ. What measures will be in place to ensure transparency in books and records for 19 \nMinnesota Power?  20 \nA. Minnesota Power will continue to provide the Commission access to Minnesota Power’s 21 \nbooks, records, and information. In addition, the Company has compiled a comparison 22 \nof SEC and other investor -related reporting that ALLETE currently undertakes to the 23 \ncomparable information that will be available to regulators after the Acquisition. This 24 \ncomparison is attached to the Petition as Attachment H. As that comparison illustrates, 25 \nthe potentially relevant information available to the Commission post -Acquisition will 26 \nbe substantially similar to what is available now – just in slightly different forms.  27 \n 28 \n Further, Minnesota Power will continue to make all required annual filings with the 29 \nCommission, including but not limited to annual capital structure filings and 30 \nJurisdictional Annual Reports . These filings  provide extensive insight into the 31 \n \n 22 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  ownership, control, and financing of the regulated utility and the consolidated ALLETE 1 \nentity. Minnesota Power will also continue to provide additional information in these 2 \nfilings as required by Commission order, including its current obligation to provide 3 \ncredit rating agency reports. Though not required by Commission Order, ALLETE will 4 \ncontinue to publish its Corporate Sustainability Report, which contains information 5 \nrelated to environmental, social, and governance issues, including the Company’s 6 \nefforts to encourage diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.  7 \n 8 \nVI. TRANSACTION AND TRANSITION COSTS  9 \nQ. What types of  transaction costs  will be incurred in connection with the 10 \nAcquisition?  11 \nA. The Company has incurred and will continue to  incur legal and other consulting fees, 12 \nregulatory filing costs , and various other costs  in order to execute the Acquisition.  13 \n 14 \nQ. Does the Company anticipate it will incur transition costs as a result of the 15 \nAcquisition?  16 \nA. The Company anticipates there will be transition costs, such as  accounting and 17 \nvaluation -related work for the opening balance sheet  and the addition of Alloy Parent 18 \nCo, new Board of Directors on -boarding, and various other costs to transition to the new 19 \nownership structure.  20 \n 21 \nQ. Will transaction  and transition  costs incurred by ALLETE  be recovered from  22 \nMinnesota Power ’s customers?  23 \nA. No. Minnesota Power will not attempt to recover  its transaction costs or transition costs  24 \nin rates  from its utility customers . ALLETE has implemented controls and procedures, 25 \nwithin its existing accounting procedures and practices,  to track and record these costs. 26 \nALLETE employees track and report their time and other expenses associated with the 27 \nproposed transaction, and that time and those expenses will be  recorded to FERC 28 \nAccount 426.5 , Other Deductions . When Minnesota Power’s  jurisdictional rates are 29 \ndeveloped based on  its costs, costs in that account are by definition  excluded . In 30 \naddition, the Company has implemented a process to review invoices from vendors 31 \n \n 23 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nAnderson  Direct and Schedule  working on the transaction to ensure that work related to the transaction is excluded 1 \nfrom Minnesota Power’s cost of service.  2 \n 3 \nQ.  Will transaction or transition costs  incurred at Alloy Parent LLC or above,  or by 4 \nthe Partners , be passed down to Minnesota Power?  5 \nA. No. Any costs re lated to the acquisition  incurred at the Alloy Parent LLC level or at the 6 \nintermediate levels above , will be recorded at that level and will not be passed down to 7 \nALLETE. All costs incurred by the Partners will remain with the Partners .  8 \n 9 \nQ.  Will adjustments to the Company’s books and records to reflect the Acquisition 10 \ntransaction be pushed down to utility customers in any other way?  11 \nA. No. Minnesota Power and the Partners will not deploy “push down accounting” (i.e., 12 \nadjustment of Minnesota Power’s asset or liability values or books and records to reflect 13 \nthe purchase price) with respect to the Acquisition.  Minnesota Power maintains its 14 \nbooks in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and does not intend to adjust 15 \nthe historical cost values of its assets and liabilities, record any goodwill, or include 16 \ncosts in its cost of service that are related to the Acquisition. In accordance with 17 \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States, Alloy Parent LLC  will 18 \naccount for the transaction using the acquisition (or purchase) method of accounting for 19 \nbusiness combinations. The related purchase accounting journal entries, including the 20 \ncreation of goodwill, will be recorded at Alloy Parent  LLC  and will not be pushed down 21 \nto ALLETE . Thus, the costs cannot be built into the rates of Minnesota  Power’s 22 \ncustomers.  23 \n 24 \nVII. CONCLUSION  25 \nQ. Does this complete your Direct Testimony ? 26 \nA.

Purchased materials and services \naccount for a large percent of the Company ’s costs  and provide us with an excellent opportunity for cost \nreduction and control .  \n \nPurchasing is an important activity where the responsibility for procurement of materials and services is \nassigned to a group of employees ( buyers ) trained in negotiating, cost  reduction, strategic sourcing, \nelectronic commerce, and other purchasing techniques.  \n \nThe primary responsibility of the Purchasing and Contracts department (Purchasing) is to purchase materials, \nsupplies,  and services with the objective of delivery at the proper time, in the proper place, in a quantity, \nquality and price consistent with the needs of the Company . This balancing of several factors is critical.  \n \nTo achieve this overall objective, the responsi bilities, authorities,  and controls set forth in this policy and \nreferenced policies must be adhered to by all employees.  \n \nResponsibilities  \n \nPurchasing has the responsibility for the procurement of all goods and services and the processing and sale \nof surp lus and obsolete materials.  \n \nOnly those persons delegated by the Company  CEO/ -President are authorized to act as agents and commit \nthe Company  for materials, equipment, supplies, and services.  \n \nPurchasing has the responsibility for obligating the Company  and for making the determination of source of \nsupply, quantities purchased, delivery schedule and price negotiations, except where others are so \nspec ifically authorized by the CEO/ President. Thes e decisions will be made in conjunction with Operations, \nAccounting, Engineering, and other departments, as appropriate.  \n \nPurchasing has the responsibility to initiate and maintain effective and professional relationships with current \nand prospective suppl iers, as well as all Company  personnel, who are the d epartment's clients. All \nemployees involved in purchasing activities will work to maintain and enhance the Company 's image by their \npersonal conduct, methods of doing business, and practicing good public relations, giving all visitors, callers, \nand Company  personnel professional , courteous treatment.  \n \nPurchasing serves as the primary channel through which requests reg arding prices for products and services \nare handled. Buyers will conduct appropriate communication with suppliers regarding  prices or quotations. In \ncases where technical details are necessary, the user department may communicate directly with supplier.  \n \n \nAll negotiations are to include the appropriate b uyers within their delegated authority.   \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMPUC Docket No, E015/PA-24-198 \nMP Exhibit ___ (Anderson) \nDirect Schedule 1 \nPage 3 of 38\n \nBuyer  Responsibilities : \n \n- Obtain and purchase all materials and services at the best economic value, considering the guidelines \nof prices, service, quality, and deliv ery.

Following corpor ate \npurchasing policy is an easy and efficient way to ensure  that we receive the best payment \nterms and pricing available. \n \nPurchas ing off-contract often leads to higher costs. Additionally, the Non-PO invoice process \nis more costly internally as it requires more time to process these types of invoices. Although \nwe realize there are bus iness reasons to occasionally use the non-PO invoice proce ss, it is in \nthe compan y’s best interest to reduce the use of non-PO invoices. Additionally, a reduction in \nNon-PO invoices c reates benefits for our sales tax department, as it allows us to utilize the \nOracle system capabilities to streamline our sales tax classifications and  ensure proper \nsales tax treatment on invoices. The following policy was developed with these concepts in \nmind. \n \nThe following purchases req uire a PO: \n \no Any service (regardless of dollar amount). This ensures  we have proper \ninsurance in p lace. \no Material purchases for inventory items. In order to proce ss an item as inventory \nit must be tied to a PO. \no Material purchases o ver $3,000. Purchases over this amou nt need to be \ncoordinated through the Purchas ing department to ensure  competitive \npricing and compliance with contracts. \n \nNote: Purchasing will not create new purchase orders for materials  and/or services \nwhich have already been ordered, received,  or completed . Any purchases that fall into \nthis category are a direct violation of the Purchasing  Non-PO invoice policy.  The \nreque ster will need a Deviation form  (provi ded by Accounts Payable or Purchasing) \napproved by the ALLETE Treasurer or VP -ALLETE Controller & Chief Accounting Officer  \nin order to pay the invoice through the non-PO process.  \n \n \nPurchas ing can help users with the creation of internal POs. These are POs that are not sent \nto the vendor but created internally to allow for more efficient process ing of invoices. Work with \nPurchasing to determine the best type of PO to use for these types of expenses. \n \nExamples of what could be on an internal PO are as follows: \n \n• Insurance \n• Landowner Payments  \n• Payroll \n• Taxes \n• Utility Bills \n \n \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMPUC Docket No, E015/PA-24-198 \nMP Exhibit ___ (Anderson) \nDirect Schedule 1 \nPage 32 of 38\nIn add ition to using POs, we can  gain invoice pay ment efficiencies by  using corporate credit \ncards. Even if the vendor charges a fee for paying by  card, the overall benefit to the \ncompany from time savings and credit card rebates is often greater. You can work with your \nsupervisor a nd purchasing  to increase your credit card limits if needed for these types of \npayments. \n \nExamples of several types of credit card purc hases include: \n \n• Catering Services off-site \n• Conference Fees \n• Professional Licenses \n• Reservation of off-site meeting rental sp aces \n• Subscriptions \n• Travel Expenses \n \n \nAny invoices  that do not follow the above policy will be sent back to the req uester. \n1. If appropriate, they will be a sked to put the charge on their corporate  credit card. \n2. If an invoice is considered a deviation from the policy , Accounts Payable or Purchasing \nwill send the Deviation form  to the employee, which then needs to be approved by \neveryone listed on the form, ending with the ALLETE Treasurer. \n \n \nPlease refer to the Purchasing Decision Tree  to determine the correct purchasing option for \neach type of purchase.  \n \n \n*Request for Payment forms are only to be used for payments when you are not able to obtain \nan invoice and the vendor does not accept credit card payments.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMPUC Docket No, E015/PA-24-198 \nMP Exhibit ___ (Anderson) \nDirect Schedule 1 \nPage 33 of 38\nCHAPTER 1 6 – LEASE POLICY  \n \nRequests for material to be leased will be in accordance with the Lease Approval Policy \neffective 1/1/2012.

INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS 1 \nQ. Please state your name and business address. 2 \nA. My name is Laura E. Krollman, and my business address is 30 West Superior Street, 3 \nDuluth, Minnesota 55802. 4 \n 5 \nQ. By whom are you employed and in what position? 6 \nA. I am employed by ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.1 My current position is 7 \nDirector – ALLETE Human Resources. 8 \n 9 \nQ. Please summarize your qualifications and experience. 10 \nA. I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Accounting from the College of St. Scholastica. I 11 \nhave 24 years of experience with the Company. During my first four years at Minnesota 12 \nPower, I worked in the internal audit department where I had the opportunity to work 13 \non a variety of operational and financial audits. I have spent the last 20 years in human 14 \nresources, where, over 10 years, I led a variety of human resources functions, including 15 \nbenefits, compensation, and talent solutions. In my current position, I am responsible 16 \nfor all areas of human resources, including the development, implementation, and 17 \nongoing administration of the Company’s employee compensation programs, executive 18 \ncompensation programs, employee benefits, learning and organizational development 19 \nprograms, talent solutions, employee and labor relations, and payroll and human 20 \nresource information systems. 21 \n 22 \nQ. Have you ever testified in any other proceeding? 23 \nA. Yes. I have previously submitted pre-filed testimony and testified in multiple rate cases 24 \nbefore the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”). Most recently, I 25 \nfiled Direct Testimony in Docket No. E015/GR-23-155. 26 \n 27 \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Direct Testimony and the \nPetition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically \ndefined, references to “ALLETE” indicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota \nPower and all regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power. \n \n 2 OAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nKrollman Direct Q. What is the purpose of your Direct Testimony? 1 \nA. The purpose of my Direct Testimony is to discuss workforce-related commitments made 2 \nby Minnesota Power and supported by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board 3 \n(“CPP Investments”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) (together, the 4 \n“Partners”) in this proposed acquisition of ALLETE (the “Acquisition”), as set forth in 5 \nthe Petition of Minnesota Power for the Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension 6 \nPlan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners (“Petition”) filed on July 19, 7 \n2024, in this proceeding. I also support certain sections of the Petition. Further, I will 8 \nreinforce Minnesota Power’s commitments to all of its employees, both bargaining and 9 \nnon-bargaining (“union” and “nonunion”). In doing so, I specifically respond to the 10 \nCommission’s Order Point 3(F) from the October 7, 2024 Order. I will also discuss the 11 \nimportance of regulatory certainty in the attraction and retention of employees of 12 \nMinnesota Power. 13 \n 14 \nQ. Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding? 15 \nA. Not at this time. 16 \n 17 \nII. THE PETITION 18 \nQ. What sections of the Petition do you sponsor? 19 \nA. I sponsor the following sections of the Petition: 20 \n Section III.B.4: Commitments to Minnesota (as to Company Employees). 21 \n 22 \nQ. What Attachments to the Petition do you sponsor? 23 \nA. None. 24 \n 25 \nIII. THE COMMISSION’S ORDER 26 \nQ. What additional information has the Commission requested with respect to 27 \nemployees of Minnesota Power? 28 \nA. In Order Point 3(F), the Commission requested that Minnesota Power provide 29 \ninformation regarding the following: 30 \n \n 3 OAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nKrollman Direct How will the acquisition impact Minnesota Power’s union and non-union 1 \nworkforce and do the protections included in the acquisition agreement 2 \nadequately protect that workforce? 3 \n 4 \nQ. Please briefly describe Minnesota Power’s workforce. 5 \nA. Minnesota Power’s collective bargaining employees represent approximately 40 6 \npercent of our workforce. Additionally, many of Minnesota Power’s contractors, 7 \nparticularly those contracted for the construction, operation, and maintenance of electric 8 \ninfrastructure, including transmission lines and power generation facilities, are also 9 \nrepresented by collective bargaining agreements. As I have testified in multiple rate 10 \ncases before the Commission, both our bargaining and non-bargaining employees are 11 \ncritically important to our company.  12 \n 13 \nQ. Will the Acquisition impact Minnesota Power’s workforce? 14 \nA. The Company does not anticipate any negative impacts to Minnesota Power’s 15 \nworkforce. Instead, the Company anticipates any impacts will be neutral to positive. 16 \nThis is a function of both the nature of the Acquisition – maintaining Minnesota Power 17 \nintact, with its current commitments to employees, customers, and other stakeholders 18 \nlikewise unchanged – and specific terms of the Acquisition itself.  19 \n 20 \nQ. Please explain. 21 \nA. Because of the importance of our workforce, Minnesota Power felt it was valuable to 22 \nensure its ongoing commitments to these workers were memorialized as part of the 23 \nAcquisition documents. This way, instead of just telling Minnesota Power’s bargaining 24 \nemployees we would continue existing relationships with both bargaining and non- 25 \nbargaining employees and collective bargaining organizations, we would have concrete 26 \nand verifiable evidence of these commitments by Minnesota Power – and the 27 \nrecognition of these relationships by the Partners.  28 \n 29 \nThus, as stated in the Petition, “For the two-year period following the Acquisition, each 30 \nALLETE nonunion employee . . . will retain extensive protections, including the same 31 \nor better employment position in the same location, and wages, incentive, benefits, and 32 \n \n 4 OAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nKrollman Direct employee protections no less favorable than those available to the employee 1 \nimmediately prior to the Acquisition.”2 Additionally, the Petition noted “ALLETE will 2 \nalso continue to honor its union contracts.”3 Partner Witnesses Jonathan Bram and 3 \nAndrew Alley also discuss the Partners’ commitments to our workforce in their Direct 4 \nTestimony. 5 \n 6 \nQ. What additional protections for employees are included in the Merger 7 \nAgreement?4 8 \nA. In addition to the two-year timeframe explained above, employees are provided with 9 \nother customary employee protections, such as recognition of pre-Acquisition service 10 \nwith ALLETE for benefit plan purposes, waiver of pre-existing condition limitations 11 \nunder post-Acquisition health plans, and credit for deductibles and co-payments under 12 \npost-closing plans for the year of the Acquisition.  13 \n 14 \nQ. How will these terms protect Minnesota Power’s workforce? 15 \nA. The Company knows that to attract, engage, and retain our top talent, we need to have 16 \ncontinuity of our market-prevalent compensation and benefit programs. The certainties 17 \noutlined in my Direct Testimony and the Direct Testimony of Witnesses Bram and Alley 18 \nensure this consistency for our current and future workforce. 19 \n 20 \nQ. Do you have anything else to add at this time? 21 \nA. While the Merger Agreement outlines protections for employees, which again provides 22 \nconcrete and verifiable evidence of the commitment to our employees, there is 23 \nadditional value the Acquisition brings to our employees in terms of how we execute 24 \nour growth strategy. Recognizing that we are a relatively small energy company seeking 25 \nsignificant financing in the public markets, without this transaction there is no guarantee 26 \nthat Minnesota Power would be able to access the capital it needs for clean energy 27 \ntransition investments, which could have an impact on our workforce needs. 28 \n \n2 Petition at 18. \n3 Petition at 18. \n4 Petition at Attachment B. \n \n 5 OAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nKrollman Direct  1 \nThe last point I will add is that it is crucial to have a timely regulatory approval process. 2 \nSuch timely approvals are likely to minimize the stress and uncertainty that employees 3 \nmight experience. Prolonged periods of ambiguity can lead to anxiety, decreased 4 \nproductivity, and even attrition as employees worry about the Company’s future and its 5 \nworkforce needs. While we have committed to provide frequent updates to employees 6 \nand have strong employee protections included in the Merger Agreement, the longer it 7 \ntakes to gain required approvals and close on the Acquisition, the more stress employees 8 \nwill need to endure.  9 \n 10 \nIV. CONCLUSION 11 \nQ. Does this complete your Direct Testimony? 12 \nA. Yes. 13"

THE PETITION   21 \nQ. What sections of the Petition do you sponsor?  22 \nA. I sponsor the following sections of the Petition:  23 \n• Section II.B.2 : Global Infrastructure Partners ; 24 \n \n1  Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Direct Testimony and the  \nPetition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically \ndefined, references to “ALLETE” indicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota \nPower and all regulated and non -regulated sub sidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n3 • Section II.C: Description of the Acquisition (as to post -Acquisition organizational 1 \nstructure);  2 \n• Section III.B.1: The Commission’s Authority Will Be Unchanged by the Acquisition  3 \n(purpose and benefits of the Acquisition) ; 4 \n• Section III.B.3: The Reasons for the Acquisition are Sound (as to the Partners’ 5 \ninterest in the Acquisition);  6 \n• Section III.B. 4: Commitments to Minnesota (as to GIP) ; 7 \n• Section IV.B.1.h: Statement on affiliated interest (Minn. R. 7825.1400, Subp. H); and  8 \n• Section IV.D.3: A list and past history of all contracts or agreements between the 9 \npetitioner and affiliated interest, consideration received, and summary of costs.  10 \n 11 \nQ. What Attachments to the Petition do you sponsor?  12 \nA. I co-sponsor the following Attachments to the Petition:  13 \n• Attachment A -2: Post -Acquisition Organizational Structure ; and  14 \n• Attachment B: Agreement and Plan of Merger . 15 \n 16 \nIV. DESCRIPTION OF ACQUISITION   17 \nQ. Please briefly  describe the Acquisition .  18 \nA. Through the Acquisition, ALLETE will transition from a publicly traded entity to a 19 \nprivately held company wholly  owned by entities managed by GIP and CPP Investments 20 \n(the “Partners”) .  The Acquisition will provid e ALLETE and Minnesota Power (together, 21 \nthe “Company”) with improved access to capital and Partner resources that can support 22 \nMinnesota Power’s investment in the clean energy transition and the continu ed delivery of 23 \nthe safe, reliable, and affordable electric service that Minnesota Power’s customers expect.  24 \n 25 \nWhile the Acquisition will change the ownership of ALLETE, many things will not change, 26 \nincluding: (1) ALLETE’s and Minnesota Power’s management team and employees, as 27 \nwell as its operations, strategy, and values; (2) the authority of the Minnesota Public Utility 28 \nCommission (the “Commission”) over Minnesota Power and its Minnesota operations; 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n4 (3) Minnesota Power’s commitments to the customers and communities it has served for 1 \nover a century; and (4) the transparency to which the Commission is accustomed in its 2 \nregulation of Minnesota Power. Moreover, the Acquisition is not expected to impact retail 3 \nor municipal rates for utility customers or otherwise adversely affect  the utility or its 4 \ncustomers . To the contrary, the Acquisition will position Minnesota Power to continue 5 \nproviding safe, reliable, and affordable service to Minnesota Power’s customers  while 6 \naccomplishing Minnesota’s ambitious goals for the energy transition.  7 \n 8 \nQ. Why is GIP making this investment in ALLETE?    9 \nA. GIP believes that the Company  represent s a unique opportunity to acquire a growth - 10 \noriented regulated electric utility in the United States  with high -quality assets across both 11 \nregulated utility and unregulated renewables businesses, and that also is in alignment with 12 \nGIP’s invest ment  criteria.  GIP’s decision to pursue the Acquisition is directly tied to 13 \nALLETE’s significant expected growth, which is being driven by the need to comply with 14 \nMinnesota’s Carbon Free Standard and requires Minnesota Power to invest unprecedented 15 \ncapital to decarbonize its generation fleet without compromising reliabil ity. At the same 16 \ntime, Minnesota Power will need to invest in its transmission and distribution systems to 17 \ndeliver this decarbonized power to the region and to Minnesota Power’s  customers. The 18 \nscale of these investments and the speed at which they must be deployed make ALLETE 19 \nan attractive investment opportunity for GIP and make GIP and CPP Investments the right 20 \npartners for ALLETE.  21 \n 22 \nEqually important to GIP is the high quality of ALLETE’s management team and 23 \nemployees, along with the Company’s established track record of delivering on its 24 \ncommitments to the customers and communities it serves. ALLETE’s strong leadership 25 \nteam is comprised of experienced energy executives with long tenures managing utility 26 \noperations, executing and optimizing large -scale energy infrastructure projects with 27 \nexceptional levels of reliability. This management team also has an established track record 28 \nof deep engagement with communities and stakeholders as well as valuing its employees 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n5 and union workers who have been instrumental in Minnesota Power’s success.  In addition, 1 \nALLETE’s robust ESG  organization has well -established policies, reporting, and 2 \ngovernance practices committed to addressing climate risk and focused on positive 3 \nstakeholder impacts including commitments to invest in its communities, encourage 4 \neconomic development, and protect low -income customers. The quality of this 5 \nmanagement team was a primary factor in GIP’s decision to pursue the Acquisition.  6 \nMaintaining this team will ensure that Minnesota Power continue s to operate and provide 7 \nhigh-quality service while making the significant investments needed to comply with the 8 \nCarbon Free Standard . 9 \n 10 \nThe Company also has attractive renewables platforms across utility -scale wind and 11 \ndistributed solar generation with full lifecycle capabilities, providing growth opportunities 12 \nand long -term contracted cash flows across a diverse mix of primarily investment -grade 13 \ncounterparties including utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and corporates with an 14 \nattractive renewable development pipeline.  15 \n 16 \nFollowing the completion of the Acquisition , GIP expects to support the management team 17 \nin executing its ambitious and policy -driven investment plan. In particular, Minnesota 18 \nPower will benefit from GIP’s experience in renewables.   GIP currently operates 19 \n22 gigawatts (“GW”) of renewable assets globally, including bringing approximately 20 \n5 GW online in the past year and approximately 176 GW under construction or in 21 \ndevelopment assets. GIP is well positioned to support and reduce the risks of Minnesota 22 \nPower’s growth plan in the long -term. This will allow Minnesota Power to maintain strong 23 \noperational performance, execute its mission of decarbonization, and increase its value, 24 \nwhich will benefit GIP’s investors, Minnesota Power’s customers, and other stakeholders.  25 \n 26 \nQ. Please briefly describe the partner  entities that will become owners of ALLETE.    27 \nA. Upon closing of the Acquisition, a wholly  owned subsidiary of CPP Investments will 28 \nacquire 40  percent of the outstanding common stock of ALLETE. GIP will hold the 29 \nremaining 60 percent of the interests in ALLETE through two funds: Global Infrastructure 30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n6 Partners V (“GIP Fund V”) which will hold 40  percent of the interests,  and Tower Bridge 1 \nInfrastructure Partners, L.P. (“Tower Bridge”)  which will hold 20  percent of the interests.  2 \nGIP Fund V is a fund managed by a GIP -controlled affiliate and Tower Bridge is a 3 \nseparately managed account (“SMA”) managed by GIP on behalf of the California Public 4 \nEmployees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) . 5 \n 6 \nQ. What is a separately managed account?  7 \nA. An SMA is an investment vehicle with a single financial investor (as opposed to a fund 8 \nwith multiple investors). Tower Bridge is an SMA managed by GIP in which CalPERS is 9 \nthe sole limited partner and financial investor.  10 \n 11 \nQ. How did GIP Investments in ALLETE come about?    12 \nA. As explained in the Direct Testimony of  Company  Witness Jeffery J. Scissons and 13 \ndiscussed in further detail in the Background of the Merger section of Attachment L in the 14 \nPetition, ALLETE engaged J.P. Morgan to perform an initial screening of potential 15 \ninvestors.  GIP has a long track record of investment in the utility sector, maintains 16 \nrelationships across the investment industry, and has the financial capability, regulatory 17 \nexperience , and ability to consummate a transaction like the Acquisition.  As a result, GIP 18 \nwas one of the initial potential buyers contacted by J.P. Morgan.  From GIP’s perspective, 19 \nwe immediately recognized that ALLETE represents a unique opportunity to invest in an 20 \nentity that fits well with GIP’s core investment goals for the reasons described earlier in 21 \nmy Direct Testimony.  22 \n 23 \nBased on my understanding of Witness  Andrew Alley’s Direct Testimony on behalf of CPP 24 \nInvestments, a similar process unfolded with respect to CPP Investments as GIP was 25 \nevaluating the potential Acquisition with ALLETE. Ultimately, GIP determined it could 26 \nsecure capital to fund at least 50  percent  of the Acquisition , and possibly more if GIP could 27 \nparticipate in the Acquisition  jointly with additional equity partners.  GIP pursued 28 \nopportunities to partner with other investors, but those discussions ended without 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n7 agreement. After CPP Investments went through a similar process, at the direction of the 1 \nALLETE Board of  Directors , representatives of J.P. Morgan introduced representatives at 2 \neach of GIP and CPP Investments to allow the Partners to pursue the Acquisition  together. 3 \nWe were already familiar with CPP Investments and its management team and previously 4 \npartnered with CPP Investments on  a prior infrastructure investment in Pacific National, a 5 \nrail freight infrastructure company in Australia. The Partners began coordinating next steps 6 \nin the potential acquisition, and in that process, it quickly became clear that the goals and 7 \ncapabilities of GIP and CPP Investments were an excellent fit for each other and for 8 \nALLETE.  9 \n 10 \nQ.  Is GIP’s investment in ALLETE intended to be a short -term or long -term 11 \ninvestment?  12 \nA. GIP’s investment in ALLETE is intended to be a long -term investment . ALLETE’s  13 \nbusiness plan involves significant growth of both generation and transmission operations  14 \nover multiple decades drive n by Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard .  While these plans 15 \nrequire significant investment in the near term, given the nature of utility regulation, GIP 16 \nrecognizes that earnings on those investments will be recovered over the long  term. Further, 17 \nsuch investments require a significant amount of time to plan, permit, and execute, 18 \nrequiring a long -term orientation.  19 \n 20 \nV. DESCRIPT ION OF GIP  21 \nQ. Please provide a summary of the topics you will address in this section of your Direct 22 \nTestimony.  23 \nA. In this section of my Direct Testimony, I will provide brief descriptions of the history of 24 \nGIP, including  GIP’s  focus on infrastructure investment, brief descriptions of GIP Fund V, 25 \nTower Bridge and BlackRock  Inc. (“BlackRock”) , and the close fit of the Company  to 26 \nGIP’s investment goals.    27 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n8 A. History and Investment Focus  1 \nQ. Please briefly describe GIP and its  business focus.   2 \nA. As explained above, GIP is the trading name for Global Infrastructure Management, LLC , 3 \nan independent, specialist infrastructure fund manager . GIP  provides investment 4 \nmanagement services and advice to the GIP funds , which hold, indirectly, investments in 5 \nportfolio companies. GIP’s investment approach is based on combining industry expertise 6 \nwith industr y best practice business management. GIP was founded in 2006 to pursue long - 7 \nterm investments in high -quality infrastructure assets and is focused on the energy 8 \ntransportation, digital , and water / waste sectors, each an area in which the GIP team has a 9 \ndepth of expertise and relationships.  10 \n 11 \nThe first investment by a GIP Flagship Fund was made in 2008  and GIP currently manages 12 \napproximately $115 billion on behalf of its investors (such as pension funds, endowments, 13 \ninsurance companies, and other sophisticated investors ) across a variety of funds. Through 14 \nits Flagship Funds, GIP employs a differentiated investment strategy of targeting control - 15 \noriented investments in high -quality businesses of scale through focused and proprietary 16 \norigination and the application of a rigorous and independent risk and ESG assessment 17 \nprocess.  18 \n 19 \nQ. What is a fund manager?  20 \nA. A fund manager is a business that specializes in forming investment funds and providing 21 \ninvestment management and advice to the funds. The fund manager does not typically 22 \nmake any significant investments on its own behalf (although it may have limited 23 \nownership interests in funds) but acts as the manager of the funds that are formed and 24 \ndirects their investments.  25 \n 26 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n9 Q. What is an investment fund?  1 \nA. An investment fund is a business entity that is formed to invest in other businesses, which 2 \nare typically referred to as portfolio companies. An investment fund raises money from 3 \ninvestors and invests it on their behalf.  4 \n 5 \nQ. You mentioned there are other GIP funds – please provide a brief description of the 6 \nGIP funds that preceded GIP Fund V.  7 \nA. GIP is currently investing out of its fifth Flagship Fund, GIP Fund V, which is the fund 8 \nthat will hold the investment in ALLETE if the Acquisition is successfully completed. GIP 9 \nFund V is preceded by GIP Fund I, GIP Fund II, GIP Fund III and GIP Fund IV, each of 10 \nwhich is briefly described below:  11 \n 12 \nFund  Year  Size Regulated \nAssets  Currently Held \nInvestments  \nGIP Fund I 2008  $5.64bn  Gatwick, \nLondon City \nAirport, Port of \nBrisbane  2 \nGIP Fund  II 2012  $8.25bn  Freeport LNG, \nEdinburgh \nAirport, Pacific \nNational  4 \nGIP Fund \nIII 2017  $15.8bn  Naturgy, Suez, \nEnLink \nMidstream  6 \nGIP Fund \nIV 2019  $22.1  Sydney Airport, \nSuez, Columbia \nPipeline  12 \nGIP Fund V Targeting \n2025  Targeting \n$25bn  Columbia \nPipeline \nSystem; Rio \nGrande LNG  n.a. \n 13 \nNote: Table excludes two additional potential investments in GIP Fund V , ALLETE and 14 \nMalaysia Airports Holding Berhard “MAHB,” which have been announced but are subject 15 \nto approvals and have not yet closed.  16 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n10  1 \nQ. What is the status of GIP Fund V? 2 \nA. GIP Fund V is currently fundraising with a target of $25.0 billion in aggregate 3 \ncommitments, the majority of which has already been raised as of December 12, 2024 , the 4 \ndate of this  Direct  Testimony .  5 \n 6 \nQ. Can you briefly explain how GIP funds are or ganized and managed?   7 \nA. As I mentioned, GIP creates funds  for the purpose of raising capital from investors then 8 \ndeploying that capital by making certain types or categories of investments (such as an 9 \ninfrastructure fund that would have the purpose of investing in infrastructure including, 10 \namong other things, public utilities).  GIP funds are commonly organized as a limited 11 \npartnership , and w hen an investor commits to making a capital commitment to the fund, it 12 \nbecomes a limited partner in the fund limited partnership. These limited partners hold only 13 \npassive interests in portfolio companies through the fund. The fund also has a general 14 \npartner, which is controlled by GIP and participates alongside the limited partners in the 15 \ninvestment s made by the fund , though the general partner generally does not have a 16 \nsignificant ownership or financial stake in the fund. This structure allows GIP to provide 17 \nclear lines of ownership and control of the assets in which each fund invests.  18 \n 19 \nThe general partner of the fund is the entity that controls the fund and makes decisions 20 \nabout the fund’s operations and investment decisions. Through GIP’s control of the general 21 \npartner entity, GIP makes investment decisions on behalf of the fund and determines 22 \nwhether to invest capital into specific companies, like ALLETE. The fund (i.e., the limited 23 \npartnership) is the legal entity that makes the actual investment into companies and is the 24 \nentity to which the limited partners and the general partner commit capital . The limited 25 \npartners provide nearly all the capital to make the investments and receive investment 26 \nincome in return, but do not have control over the investment decisions.  This is the post - 27 \nAcquisition structure shown in Figure 2 in and Attachment  A-2 to the Petition with respect 28 \nto ALLETE. An investment committee of decision makers , including founders and senior 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n11 management members of GIP , sits at GIP’s general partner entity  and make s investment 1 \ndecisions on behalf of the general partner of GIP Fund V and Tower Bridge, with GIP 2 \nproviding advisor services.  3 \n 4 \nQ. How will GIP be compensated for its management services related to ALLETE?  5 \nA. As with its other portfolio company investments, GIP’s primary compensation in relation 6 \nto ALLETE will be through fees paid by investors in GIP Fund V and Tower Bridge  in 7 \nreturn for investment management services  provided by GIP .  This is a standard private 8 \nequity structure in which the management fees will be based on investor commitments and 9 \nactual invested capital .  10 \n 11 \nQ. How do GIP’s goals for investments differ from a public shareholder’s goals in 12 \ninvesting in stocks of a publicly traded company?  13 \nA. There are different expectations, timelines, and risk levels between shareholders of publicly 14 \ntraded stock and a private equity fund. Public shareholders typically desire a regular 15 \npayment of dividends or other forms of cash from their investments, whereas private 16 \ninvestors are more focused on long -term investments and therefore have an ability and 17 \ndesire to exercise more patience by forgoing short -term quarterly earnings and dividends 18 \nin favor of longer -term growth of the portfolio company and thus their investment. Public 19 \nshareholders’ holdings are liquid, meaning they can exit or sell their holdings at any time. 20 \nIn contrast, GIP’s investment i n ALLETE is not liquid . Thus, while GIP and its investors 21 \noperate on and commit capital based on a long -term investment assumption, public 22 \nshareholders are not bound to any investment period and are able to (and often do) sell 23 \ninterests based on shorter -term considerations.  24 \n 25 \nQ. How does GIP’s focus on infrastructure investments affect specific portfolio 26 \ncompanies like ALLETE ? 27 \nA. GIP’s focus on and experience in  private equity infrastructure investments allow s GIP to 28 \nprovide unique support to its portfolio companies in a variety of ways. As discussed later 29 \nin my Direct Testimony , GIP and CPP Investments both will provide  stable and consistent 30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n12 access to equity  capital through the Acquisition but also can facilitate deep lending 1 \nrelationships to support the goals and needs of the Company . This support from the Partners 2 \nwill allow the Company to focus less on day -to-day market conditions and more on 3 \nstrategies and operations to meet customers’ needs and the State  of Minnesota ’s energy 4 \ngoals over the long term.  5 \n  6 \nQ. How does this type of support look in practice?  7 \nA. GIP does not conduct the day -to-day operation of its portfolio companies .  As I have 8 \nexplained, the Partners ha ve committed to maintain the existing  ALLETE senior 9 \nmanagement team with the expectation that existing senior management will continue to 10 \noperate the utility in the normal course and consistent with management functions. The 11 \nsupport of the Partners will be an additional asset, helping to unlock value for customers 12 \nwhile helping Minnesota Power  meet its goals and the policy goals of the State of 13 \nMinnesota. GIP will provide  this support to the Company  through the appointment of 14 \nexperienced, professional board members who will cooperate with other board members 15 \nand the current Company management. Furthermore, joint governance between GIP and 16 \nCPP Investments will ensure that the expertise of each will be utilized and that the interests 17 \nof the Partners  and the Company  are aligned. The stability that results ensures that the 18 \nbusiness plan is executed efficiently.    19 \n 20 \nAn example from GIP’s current fund investments might be helpful.  To encourage 21 \nalignment across our portfolio, GIP has formed a CEO Council of certain platform 22 \ncompanies in the utility subsector to share best practices between its investments, 23 \nincluding, for example, benefits of development knowledge, expertise, relationships, 24 \noperations and maintenance best practices, and purchasing power. The CEO Council 25 \nconsists of the CEOs of Vena Energy, Clearway, Eolian, Skyborn and Atlas Renewable 26 \nEnergy, along with two GIP investment partners. This council allows GIP to provide 27 \nthrough portfolio company board members valuable insight into options available to the 28 \ncompany to capture value and mitigat e risk across multiple areas of the business . In this 29 \nway, GIP’s experience provides a number of potential areas for collaboration with 30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n13 ALLETE, including procurement, capex management, energy yield optimization, debt 1 \nfinancing, tax equity , and other areas to share best practices. This is one way that GIP 2 \nexpects to be able to leverage its scale and capabilities to add value to Minnesota Power , 3 \nits customers, and communities.  4 \n 5 \nQ. You mentioned that GIP invested in other utilities;  can you  give examples of some of 6 \nthose utility investments ?  7 \nA. Yes, GIP has made several utility investments across previous GIP funds (GIP Fund III 8 \nand GIP Fund  IV) and SMAs  (like Tower Bridge, which are  GIP-managed investment 9 \nvehicles on behalf of single investors).  GIP currently owns a co-controlling stake  in 10 \nNaturgy Energy Group (“Naturgy”) , which is one of the largest integrated utilities and 11 \ninfrastructure companies in Europe with over 3.8 million electric customers in Spain and 12 \nover 1 million electric customers in Argentina and Panama. Naturgy  also owns gas utilities 13 \nin Europe and Latin America serving over 10 million customers. GIP invested in Naturgy 14 \nin September 2016  and during this period has invested €12.5  billion  of capex, of which 15 \n€7.4 billion  was related to growth  projects, including  the addition of approximately 2 GW 16 \nof renewable capacity (+65  percent  increase) and an approximately 30  percent  reduction 17 \nin total greenhouse gas emissions relative to 2017 levels .   18 \n 19 \nGIP also owns a co -controlling stake in Scotia Gas Networks (“SGN”) , which is the second 20 \nlargest gas utility in the United Kingdom with assets in both England and Scotland, serving 21 \napproximately 6 million customers. GIP invested in SGN through SMAs in March 2022  22 \nand, in addition to expected upgrades and investments to maintain safety and deliver on 23 \nlong-term performance objectives , GIP  has helped SGN launch the world’s first 100  24 \npercent  hydrogen -to-homes heating network, which is still under construction and will 25 \nconnect to 300 residential customers in Scotland.  26 \n 27 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n14 Q. In addition to utilities, does GIP own and operate other regulated infrastructure 1 \nassets?  2 \nA. Yes, GIP has been managing and investing in other regulated assets (e.g. airports, ports, 3 \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission -regulated midstream assets) since investing 4 \nthrough its first Flagship Fund, GIP Fund I, in 2009 . A good example of GIP’s regulated 5 \ninfrastructure investments is its investment in Gatwick Airport (“Gatwick”).  Gatwick is the 6 \nsecond largest airport in the United Kingdom  and is regulated by the Civil Aviation 7 \nAuthority (the United Kingdom’s aviation regulator). GIP initially invested in Gatwick 8 \nthrough GIP Fund I in December 2009  and continues to invest in Gatwick today . During 9 \nthis time , Gatwick has modernized and expanded the airport facilities, improved the 10 \npassenger experience , and ranked as the world’s most efficient and busiest single runway 11 \nairport.   12 \n 13 \nQ. Please describe GIP’s prior investments and experience in the renewable energy 14 \nsector.  15 \nA. GIP is a leading investor in the renewables sector across key geographies and technologies 16 \nand has significant experience scaling and de -risking platforms. Approximately a quarter 17 \nof GIP’s investments to date have involved renewables. GIP’s renewable portfolio is one 18 \nof the largest renewables platforms in the United States  and globally. GIP’s current 19 \nrenewables portfolio includes approximately $15 billion of equity invested or committed 20 \nacross 22 GW in operation, or in 23 GW of operating or under -construction renewables 21 \nprojects royalty interests, and approximately 176 GW under construction or in 22 \ndevelopment. GIP has invested in large -scale renewables businesses in the United States , 23 \nLatin America, Europe, and Asia -Pacific through its ownership of Vena Energy, Clearway 24 \nEnergy, Eolian, Chile Renovables, Bluepoint Wind (formerly referred to as NY Bight), 25 \nSkyborn Renewables (formerly wpd Offshore), Atlas Renewables, and its joint ventures 26 \nwith Ørsted.  27 \n 28 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n15 Q. Does GIP have a specific focus when looking at potential  investments ?   1 \nA. GIP pursues a differentiated investment strategy and specific assessment process. Part of 2 \nGIP’s investment assessment process involves a rigorous and independent risk and ESG 3 \nassessment, including a focus on carbon reduction (decarbonization) throughout the life 4 \ncycle of an investment . The acceleration of climate action, decarbonization , and energy 5 \ntransition are at the core of GIP’s approach to investing and operating our businesses  and 6 \nrepresent a strategic opportunity and potential value driver for our target sectors and 7 \nportfolio companies.  GIP focuses on investments in these areas because GIP has 8 \ndetermined that they present opportunities to deploy large amounts of capital that will result 9 \nin long -term, stable returns for investors.  GIP expects all traditional infrastructure sectors 10 \nto face a similar need for significant capital investment and has therefore developed a 11 \nfocused and careful approach to new infrastructure investments.  12 \n 13 \nQ. How does that specific focus relate to the Company ? 14 \nA. GIP’s investment in the Company  is an excellent example of what this assessment process 15 \nand investment strategy look like in practice. As I explained above, GIP’s decision to 16 \npursue the Acquisition is directly tied to Minnesota Power’s  plan to decarbonize its 17 \ngeneration fleet while investing concurrently in its transmission and distribution systems 18 \nin order to deliver this decarbonized power to its customers and comply with Minnesota’s 19 \nCarbon Free Standard  policy.  ALLETE already has attractive renewables platforms across 20 \nutility -scale wind and distributed solar generation and the Partners are committed to 21 \nsupporting and helping grow these platforms. More generally , the Company  also has a 22 \nrobust ESG organization with well-established policies, reporting, and governance 23 \npractices committed to addressing climate risk and focused on positive stakeholder impacts 24 \nincluding commitments to invest in its communities, economic development, and to protect 25 \nlow-income customers.  26 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n16 B. GIP Fund V 1 \nQ. Please  briefly describe GIP Fund V and its structure.  2 \nA. GIP Fund  V, the most recent of the GIP funds, is an investment limited partnership that is 3 \ncurrently fundraising and being developed.  Consistent with the above description of the 4 \nGIP funds generally, GIP Fund V will follow the typical GIP fund structure, which 5 \nincludes : (i) the general partner,  here, Global Infrastructure GP V, L.P. , (ii) the limited 6 \npartners, and (iii) the GIP Fund V fund itself .  Global Infrastructure Management, LLC  7 \nserves as t he advisor  of the fund and is responsible for the day-to-day operations of GIP 8 \nFund V, including portfolio management and adminis trative services  (i.e., investigating, 9 \nanalyzing, structuring and negotiating potential investments, managing and monitoring the 10 \nperformance of portfolio investments and advising as to disposition opportunities), while 11 \nthe general partner has authority and control over the conduct and affairs of GIP Fund V 12 \nand is the ultimate decision -maker relating to the selection and disposition of GIP Fund 13 \nV’s investments . GIP Fund V also has an investment committee and a portfolio 14 \nmanagement committee, which consist of GIP personnel , who oversee  GIP Fund V’s initial 15 \ninvestment process and ongoing portfolio management, respectively .  The limited partners 16 \nin GIP Fund V have economics rights but are not involved in the investment decisions or 17 \nother day -to-day operations of the fund .  18 \n 19 \nQ. Please describe the investment objectives of GIP Fund V.  20 \nA. GIP Fund  V’s investment strategy builds on GIP’s previous Flagship Funds (GIP Fund I 21 \nthrough GIP  Fund  IV).  Specifically, GIP Fund  V seeks to invest in critical, national , and 22 \neconomic real infrastructure assets primarily in developed countries with the following 23 \ncharacteristics: (i)  long-life, real infrastructure assets; (ii) high barriers to entry; (iii) 24 \nfavorable policy support and supportive regulation; and (iv) alignment with thematic 25 \ntrends, including energy transition and positive decarbonization impacts.  26 \n 27 \nGIP Fund  V aims to invest in long -term, high -quality real infrastructure assets of significant 28 \nscale that have favorable policy and regulatory support and that align with GIP’s key 29 \nthematic trends such as the expansion of renewable energy and decarbonization. Through 30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n17 careful sector and geographic portfolio construction, GIP Fund V seeks to deliver a 1 \ndiversified infrastructure portfolio with strong investment attributes, including risk - 2 \nadjusted outperformance; resilience and strong downside protection; and inflation 3 \nprotection.  4 \n 5 \nQ. What is the current status of fund  raising for GIP Fund V?  6 \nA. GIP Fund V has a target of $25 billion and the majority of that target already has been 7 \nraised as of the date of this testimony.  The amount raised to date is sufficient to support 8 \nthe current and future investments in ALLETE.  9 \n 10 \nQ. What does that mean for ALLETE?  11 \nA. GIP Fund  V can access and deploy the currently committed capital into investments that 12 \nalign with GIP’s investment criteria, including ALLETE. As I mentioned, c urrent funding 13 \nin GIP Fund V provides sufficient capital reserved to complete the Acquisition and fund 14 \nALLETE’s future equity needs over time , along with the prior investments made by GIP 15 \nFund V.  This means that the success of the Acquisition and future ALLETE capital 16 \nexpenditures do not depend on any further investment into GIP Fund V.   17 \n 18 \nQ. Has GIP made other investments since fund raising began in 2023?  19 \nA. Yes.  To date, GIP Fund V has closed three investments since GIP Fund V funding began 20 \nin 2023: Columbia Gulf Transmission, LLC, Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC, and Rio 21 \nGrande LNG, LLC.   22 \n 23 \nQ, When will GIP Fund V be closed?  24 \nA. The target closing date for GIP Fund V is March 31, 2025.  25 \n 26 \nQ. Will any additional investors be added to GIP Fund V after GIP Fund V closes?  27 \nA. No.  Once a fund closes, fund raising for such fund also closes, meaning no new capital or 28 \ninvestors are introduced.  Since GIP Fund  V is expected to close on March 31, 2025, no 29 \nnew capital or investors will be added after that date.   30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n18  1 \nQ. Will GIP Fund V make future investments after closure of GIP Fund V funding?  2 \nA. Once the fund raising for GIP Fund V closes, the fund will have a five -year investment 3 \nperiod where it will consider making other investments  besides ALLETE , but in all cases 4 \nGIP Fund V will retain capital to invest in and support their existing portfolio company 5 \ninvestments, including ALLETE, for the life of GIP Fund V plus any extensions.   6 \n 7 \nQ. How will  GIP Fund V evaluate  whether to invest in projects ?  8 \nA. As explained in the Direct Testimony of Company and Partners Witness  Ann Bulkley, a 9 \nfund like GIP  Fund  V does seek to maximize the return on its investments for investors 10 \ncommensurate with the risk of the investment portfolio .  Like any other investor, at the 11 \ntime an individual investment is considered , GIP will evaluate the risk of the given 12 \ninvestment and set an expectation regarding the return required for that investment , 13 \nevaluating whether GIP will have the opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return upon 14 \nthe investment.  Importantly, however, prior to committing to invest in ALLETE we 15 \nevaluated and determined we are supportive of ALLETE’s significant capital growth plan.  16 \nAs I will explain later, in addition to the history of successful management and operation 17 \nat Minnesota Power, one of the main features of the Acquisition that was attractive to the 18 \nPartners  was the fact that Minnesota Power is regulated by the Commission .  Appropriate 19 \nCommission oversight  consistent with its existing polic ies and regulation s will help 20 \nprovide stable returns on the significant investments that must be made in the coming years . 21 \n 22 \nC. Tower Bridge  23 \nQ. Please br iefly describe Tower Bridge.  24 \nA. Tower Bridge is a separately managed account, which is a GIP -managed investment 25 \nvehicle with a single investor that is slightly different  from GIP Fund V, which has many 26 \ninvestors.  Tower Bridge’s sole limited partner is CalPERS.  A GIP affiliate  is the general 27 \npartner of Tower Bridge. GIP will provide inves tment advice and management services to 28 \nTower Bridge  just as it does with GIP Fund V.   29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n19  1 \nQ. How did the CalPERS investment in Tower Bridge come about?  2 \nA. GIP and CalPERS have maintained a strong relationship since 2009.  As of June 2024, 3 \nTower Bridge has invested over $2.5 billion and currently has adequate capital for and will 4 \ncontribute 20  percent of the initial investment in ALLETE.  As I stated above, after the 5 \nAcquisition , Tower Bridge, in conjunction with GIP Fund V and CPP Investments, will 6 \nretain capital to invest in and support their existing investments, including ALLETE.  7 \n 8 \nQ. Please describe Tower Bridge’s investment objectives.  9 \nA. Tower Bridge ’s investment objectives mirror those of the Partners and Company generally, 10 \nincluding significant investment in both generation and transmission capabilities while 11 \ntransitioning to a clean energy platform.   Like GIP Fund V, Tower Bridge has a long-term 12 \ninvestment horizon that will look past short -term quarterly and annual earnings variability 13 \nto fund projects that will earn reasonable regulated returns over time.   14 \n 15 \nQ. Is GIP compensated for the services it provides to Tower Bridge?   16 \nA. Yes. GIP receives management fees based on actual capital invested during the investment 17 \nperiod of the fund.  18 \n 19 \nD. BlackRock   20 \nQ. How is BlackRock involved in the Acquisition?  21 \nA. After the Acquisition  of ALLETE  was negotiated and announced, BlackRock acquired the 22 \nfund advisor entity Global Infrastructure Management, LLC, but BlackRock is not 23 \ninvolved in the Acquisition.  BlackRock is a publicly traded investment management firm 24 \nwhose sole business is providing investment management services to its mutual funds, 25 \ninvestment accounts, and other investment funds. While BlackRock indirectly acquired the 26 \nfund advisor entity Global Infrastructure Management, LLC, the management team of GIP 27 \ncontinues to manage the key strategic direction, operations, and activities of the GIP funds 28 \nthemselves (including decisions in respect of the portfolio companies  held by the funds ). 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n20 Accordingly, strategic and day -to-day operations and activities of GIP and its funds will 1 \ncontinue to be managed by the current management team of GIP and not by BlackRock.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Does the BlackRock acquisition change GIP’ s role or the character of the 4 \nAcquisition?  5 \nA. No.  As explained earlier in my Direct Testimony, GIP Fund V (40  percent ) and Tower 6 \nBridge (20  percent ) are making the investment in the Company , and the strategic and day - 7 \nto-day operations and activities of GIP and its funds will continue to be organized and 8 \nmanaged by the management team of GIP independently from BlackRock .  Specifically, 9 \nthe investment decisions of GIP -managed funds will continue to be made by the investment 10 \ncommittee of the respective fund , which sits at the fund’s general partner entity .  The voting  11 \nmembers of the investment committee of GIP Fund V and Tower Bridge are GIP personnel 12 \nwho will continue to operate independently from BlackRock after the BlackRock 13 \ntransaction.  As such, BlackRock does not have control over the strategic and day -to-day 14 \noperations and activities of GIP, much less those of the Company . 15 \n 16 \nQ. Will the Black Rock transaction diminish any of GIP’s obligations to its funds, 17 \nALLETE, or commitments made by GIP in this proceeding?  18 \nA. No, BlackRock will not affect or diminish the commitments made by GIP, and GIP remains 19 \ncommitted to fulfilling its obligations and commitments to its funds and to ALLETE . As 20 \nnoted in the Petition, BlackRock is currently a direct  investor in ALLETE . Just as 21 \nBlackRock is focused on investment management and not company management now,  22 \nafter closing of the Acquisition by the Partner s, BlackRock management will not be 23 \ninvolved in investment decisions  or manage the key strategic direction, operations, or 24 \nactivities of the GIP funds  or their portfolio companies . All investment decisions for a GIP 25 \nfund are made by the investment committee of the fund, which is a committee of the general 26 \npartner of the fund  made up of GIP senior professionals .  27 \n 28 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n21 VI. FUTURE OPERATION OF ALLETE  1 \nQ. How will ALLETE  be governed after the Acquisition ?  2 \nA. After the Acquisition, ALLETE will continue to exist as a corporate entity, owning and 3 \noperating Minnesota Power and its other utility and non -utility businesses , and ALLETE 4 \nwill continue to be directly managed by a Board of Directors, with the Partners expecting 5 \nto jointly govern through consent rights . As explained in Company Witness  Scissons ’ 6 \nDirect Testimony , ALLETE will continue to have its own Board of Directors with similar 7 \nresponsibilities and authority to the current Board.  8 \n 9 \nQ. What is the basic governance structure that the Par tners intend for ALLETE?  10 \nA. The ALLETE Board will provide oversight focused on ensuring that the Company is 11 \nmanaged in a manner that builds long -term value for shareholders, customers, employees, 12 \nand communities, continuing to focus on the current values, culture, and strategy of the 13 \nCompany.  The ALLETE B oard will continue to have an active role overseeing the 14 \nCompany’s strategy and approving the strategic direction of the Company, including any 15 \nchanges in long -term capital structure, significant transactions, and any entry into 16 \nsubstantial new lines of business.  17 \n 18 \nQ. How will the members of the  ALLETE B oard be selected?  19 \nA. The Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer  of ALLETE, Bethany M. Owen, will be 20 \non the Board, and the other members will be appointed by the Partners.  The Board will 21 \ninclude local representation as well, with a t least one Director from Minnesota, another 22 \nfrom Wisconsin, and at least two Directors who will be independent.   GIP feels these are 23 \nimportant commitments that help ensure consistency and representation of local interests 24 \non the ALLETE Board.  Maintaining local representation on the ALLETE B oard will help 25 \nensure the Board has the benefit of knowledge and information of local interests to factor 26 \ninto its decisions.  27 \n  28 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n22 Q. Are these governance arrangements common for these types of entities?  1 \nA. Yes, this arrangement reflects the commonly recognized economic principle that the parties 2 \nthat bear the economic risk and results of the business’s operations should determine 3 \nmembership of the boards of directors and decide the key drivers of such operations, such 4 \nas the budgets and business plan adopted for the business, and the execution thereof by its 5 \nofficers.  The Partners’ substantial commitment of resources through the Acquisition 6 \ndemonstrates their intent to support and ensure the success of ALLETE  and its utility 7 \ncustomers, and the governance arrangement allows the Partners to provide that support.  8 \nThe fact that the internal cash generated by ALLETE will not be sufficient to meet the 9 \nrequirements of ALLETE’s capital expenditure plan  adds to the significance and scope of 10 \nthe Partner’s commitment and support for these governance arrangements.  I will discuss 11 \nthe scope of ALLETE’s capital expenditure requirements in relation to ALLETE’s 12 \nprobable earnings later in my Direct Testimony.   13 \n 14 \nQ. Does GIP anticipate making any changes to the operation of ALLETE or Minnesota 15 \nPower after acquiring ALLETE?  16 \nA. No. GIP is not expecting any changes in operations as a direct result of the Acquisition .  17 \nMinnesota Power will continue to operate within the current family of ALLETE companies 18 \nand with the current management and staffing to support safe, reliable, and affordable 19 \nelectric service. The Acquisition , likewise, will not change the way the Company operates 20 \nto serve its customers. Minnesota Power will remain regulated by the Commission and 21 \nsubject to all the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements governing investor - 22 \nowned utilities in Minnesota.  23 \n 24 \nQ. Will ALLETE’s senior management team be retained after the Acquisition?  25 \nA. Yes, ALLETE’s current senior management team will be maintained consistent with the 26 \nterms of the Merger Agreement, subject to changes to account for voluntary departures or 27 \nterminations in the ordinary course.  As explained in the Petition and in my testimony 28 \nabove, the high quality of ALLETE’s management team and employees was an important 29 \nfactor in GIP’s decision to pursue the Acquisition . GIP recognizes the importance of the 30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n23 strong, experienced team that has helped ALLETE manage utility operations, execute, and 1 \noptimize large -scale energy infrastructure projects, and maintain exceptional standards of 2 \nreliability.  3 \n 4 \nQ. Will ALLETE management continue to exercise its current functions?  5 \nA. Yes.  ALLETE management will continue to manage operations of the business  consistent 6 \nwith how Company Witness  Scissons describes current operations in his Direct Testimony . 7 \nIn particular, the Minnesota Power management team makes the day -to-day decisions that 8 \nare needed to operate the utility and provide safe, reliable, and affordable service to 9 \ncustomers. Some important decisions, such as approval of budgets , financing , and strategy , 10 \nare reviewed and approved by the Board. The Partners do not intend to change this structure 11 \nor relationship.  12 \n 13 \nVII. ACCESS TO CAPITAL  14 \nQ. What do you see as some of the key benefits of the Acquisition of ALLETE  by the 15 \nPartners ?   16 \nA. As explained in the Petition, one of the key benefits of the Acquisition is the availability 17 \nof capital from the Partners to support the needs of the Company.  Obtaining improved 18 \naccess to equity capital from the Partners is important because it is more stable and less 19 \nvolatile than relying on public equity financing.   Access to capital from the Partners also 20 \nwill help ALLETE overcome some of the challenges it could face obtaining equity in the 21 \npublic equity markets.  These benefit s are more fully explained in the Direct Testimon ies 22 \nof Company Witness Joshua D. Taran  and Company and Partner Witness John D. 23 \nQuackenbush.   24 \n 25 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n24 Q. Do you agree with Company Witness  Taran’s  assessment of ALLETE’s  need for 1 \naccess to capital?  2 \nA. Yes.  GIP also identified similar issues related to ALLETE’s need for and access to capital 3 \nand that is one of the primary reasons the Acquisition is beneficial to both the Partners and 4 \nALLETE, including Minnesota Power.  5 \n 6 \nQ. Given the challenges in funding ALLETE’s  capital expansion plan, why is GIP 7 \npursuing the Acquisition?  8 \nA. The fact that there was this significant capital need was a material driver in GIP’s decision 9 \nto acquire ALLETE.  The Acquisition provides a solution to ALLETE’s challenges 10 \naccessing capital and will allow ALLETE’s skilled management team to deploy GIP’s 11 \ncapital to the benefit of GIP, ALLETE, and Minnesota Power’s customers.  12 \n 13 \nFurther,  ALLETE will represent  a key asset for GIP into which we can deploy our capital  14 \nconsistent with our long -term investment strategies to focus on infrastructure investments 15 \nin decarbonization with regulated returns . To the extent that there are risks in achieving the 16 \ncapital plan, the  challenges factored into GIP’s valuation  and decision to invest .  The 17 \nAcquisition will also benefit the Company  by allow ing it to access capital from the Partners 18 \nwhen needed to support the reliability, safety, and development of evolving electricity 19 \ninfrastructure and allow the Company to focus less on day -to-day market conditions and 20 \nmore on its strategies and operations to meet customers’ needs and state energy goals.  21 \n 22 \nAdditionally, capital from the Partners  will be more accessible than what may be available 23 \nin the public market and comparatively more flexible on a long -term investment horizon 24 \nand timing with respect to raising capital. With private owners, ALLETE will no longer 25 \nneed access to equity financing through the public market, which is preferable given 26 \nALLETE’s outsized capital needs relative to other industry participants and the potential 27 \nfor dilutive effects of raising capital in the public markets. The Acquisition will not cause  28 \nALLETE to lose access to the large institutional investors active in public markets  because 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n25 the Partners have relationships with large institutional investors that they can leverage after 1 \nclosing.  Rather, the Acquisition will add to the existing base of available investors through 2 \nthe Partners’ relationships with banking institutions and other investors and improve 3 \nALLETE’s flexibility in accessing capital.  4 \n 5 \nQ. How can Minnesota Power’s stakeholders be assured that GIP will make the 6 \ninvestments in ALLETE  that ALLETE  needs?  7 \nA. It is important to recognize that, notwithstanding current investment plans or statutory or 8 \nregulatory requirements, i ndividual investment decisions for Minnesota Power will 9 \ncontinue to be made based on an assessment of the risk of the given investment and the 10 \nexpectation of the return required for and available from that investment .  As I discussed 11 \nabove, however, GIP made its decision to invest in ALLETE based in part on the 12 \nCommission’s regulation of Minnesota Power and its rules and regulations related to 13 \ndetermination of the return available from Minnesota Power’s investments.  On that basis, 14 \nGIP expects it will have the opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return upon 15 \ninvestment s in ALLETE, particularly in light of the fact that many of the investments 16 \nALLETE plans to make are not discretionary but are required in order to meet Minnesota’s 17 \nCarbon Free Standard .  18 \n 19 \nFurthermore, GIP’s interests and the interests of its investors are fully aligned with the 20 \ninterest s and needs of Minnesota Power and ALLETE more broadly.  Like any other 21 \ninvestor, GIP seeks to maximize the return on its investments and has an obligation to its 22 \ninvestors to try to do so.  But GIP will only obtain a good return on its investment if 23 \nALLETE is successful in both the short and long term. And t he success of ALLETE is 24 \ninextricably driven by the success of Minnesota Power , which in turn depends on 25 \nMinnesota Power continuing to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electricity service to 26 \ncustomers and complying with the regulatory requirements of the Commission  and the 27 \npolicy goals of the State of Minnesota . In short, GIP’s investment will only do well if 28 \nMinnesota Power does well, and GIP recognizes that substantial investments into 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n26 Minnesota Power will be needed for Minnesota Power to continue to do well  and comply 1 \nwith the statutory and regulatory requirements in the State of Minnesota . 2 \n 3 \nFurther,  GIP’s investment in ALLETE is not liquid because it cannot be readily reduced, 4 \nmuch less entirely sold, into an established market and the transfer of GIP’s investment in 5 \nALLETE would require Commission approval.   In other words, the return that the GIP 6 \ninvestors expect and could receive from the investment in ALLETE depends on the long- 7 \nterm success of ALLETE itself  not the ability to quickly sell GIP’s interests in ALLETE .  8 \nThat long-term success requires additional investments in ALLETE necessary to support 9 \nits future needs.  10 \n 11 \nWhile the specific form of these investments will be determined through the regulatory 12 \nprocess, it is clear that significant capital investments will be required to meet the 13 \nrequirements of Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard .  Moreover, ALLETE can benefit from 14 \nincreased access to capital from the Acquisition and meet these state requirements only if 15 \nthe Partners actually provide the capital that is needed. GIP is committed to making that 16 \ncapital accessible as is apparent from the scope of the investment: GIP is investing more 17 \nthan $2 billion to purchase ALLETE, representing 60 percent of the Acquisition price, and 18 \nwill invest additional capital to fund future capital expenditures.  19 \n 20 \nThese facts demonstrate  that GIP is committed to investing in ALLETE  and that the only 21 \nway to make the investment in ALLETE successful is to support and provide capital for 22 \nALLETE’s investment plan .  In addition, as discussed in the Direct Testimony of Company 23 \nWitness  Colin B. Anderson and Company and Partner Witness  Ellen Lapson, the Partners 24 \nhave agreed to ring -fencing protections against diversion of Minnesota Power’s resources, 25 \nwhich provides further protection  for the utility and its customers . This combination of 26 \nfactors provides solid assurance that the interests of Minnesota Power and its customers 27 \nwill be secured and that needed investments will be made.    28 \n 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n27 Q. What is the magnitude of GIP’s  commitment to make the investments that ALLETE  1 \nrequires ? 2 \nA. GIP recognizes that the investments needed for ALLETE to comply with Minnesota policy 3 \nrequirements are very significant. In fact, making these investments will likely require 4 \nadditions to ALLETE’s equity that are similar to virtually all of ALLETE’s  earnings for 5 \nthe next ten years. GIP further recognizes that these investments are necessary to comply 6 \nwith Minnesota law and Commission requirements. In short, GIP anticipates substantial 7 \ninvestment into ALLETE and relatively limited dividends to GIP and the other Partners in 8 \nthe short  term. GIP  is committed to making these necessary investments and to ensuring 9 \nthe long -term success of ALLETE  and the investments that it will make .  10 \n 11 \nQ. Could ownership by the Partners also provide benefits in relation to ALLETE’s 12 \naccess to debt financing?  13 \nA. Yes, the Partners also could  provide benefits to the Company with respect to debt financing  14 \nthrough the Partners’ existing relationships within the financial industry, which could help 15 \nfacilitate financing opportunities that otherwise might not be available to ALLETE absent 16 \nthe relationship with the Partners .  Unprecedented capital expenditures like those described 17 \nby Company Witness Taran and  Company and  Partner Witness Quackenbush may pressure 18 \nvaluation and debt metrics, and therefore would reasonably increase borrowing costs for 19 \nALLETE. Access to private markets can help avoid and alleviate the upward pressure on 20 \nborrowing costs.  21 \n 22 \nWith respect to the Acquisition specifically, t he Partner -created entity known as Alloy 23 \nParent LLC (“Alloy Parent”), which is the vehicle used to acquire all shares of ALLETE 24 \nand hold all interest in the enterprise going forward, will be the 100  percent  owner of 25 \nALLETE following the close of the proposed Acquisition. As an initial matter, Alloy 26 \nParent already has received commitments for a term loan and a revolving credit facility, 27 \nproviding for up to $300  million (out of a total $600 million term loan) and $100 million 28 \nof revolving credit debt financing, respectively, available after the Acquisition closes to 29 \nfund future capital projects. The Partners expect $300  million  of the term loan to be used 30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n28 to fund the purchase price for the capital stock of ALLETE at closing, while the revolving 1 \ncredit facility and remaining portion of the term loan that may be borrowed for purposes 2 \nof go -forward support for ALLETE .  This capital will be contributed by Alloy Parent to 3 \nALLETE in the form of equity contributions, with debt remaining at the Alloy Parent level.  4 \nThe term loan and revolver will be non -recourse with respect to ALLETE, its subsidiaries, 5 \nand their assets, as  neither  ALLETE , the Minnesota Power  utility, nor ALLETE’s  6 \nsubsidiaries will be obligors under such facilities .  The credit facilities of ALLETE will not 7 \nbe tied to any credit ratings of Alloy Parent or its affiliates and no credit facilities at the 8 \nAlloy Parent level or above would cause cross -default or cross -acceleration of ALLETE’s 9 \ncredit facilities . In other words, a failure by the Partners to re -pay the term loan and revolver 10 \nwill not directly permit the lender to seek to obtain the assets of ALLETE or Minnesota 11 \nPower  or seek acceleration of any ALLETE credit facilities .  12 \n 13 \nQ. In addition to the capital commitments, are the Partners making any other 14 \ncommitments as part of the Acquisition ? 15 \nA. Yes, t he Partners have made a number of other commitments as discussed in more detail 16 \non pages 17 through 22 of the Petition.  I will provide more detail about these commitments 17 \nthroughout this section.  18 \n 19 \nQ. How will affiliated interest and conflict of interest concerns be handled given the 20 \nscope of other investments by GIP?  21 \nA. Minnesota Power , and not GIP, will continue to be the entity subject to the Commission’s 22 \nrules and requirements related to affiliated interest agreements. Company Witness 23 \nAnderson provides more information about how that will work at the ALLETE level 24 \nfollowing the Acquisition.   GIP is committed to following the Commission’s requirements 25 \nrelated to affiliated interests, as protecting the integrity of its investments is a core part of 26 \nGIP’s business model.    27 \n 28 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n29 Q.  Will the Acquisition by the Partners impose significant added debt on ALLETE or 1 \nthe ownership structure of ALLETE?  2 \nA. No.  The Acquisition is structured with very low debt leverage, expected to be $300 million 3 \nof a total of $3.9 billion Acquisition price, which is less than 8 percent . This is unlike many 4 \nAcquisitions, which often include debt financing for a substantial portion of the Acquisition 5 \nprice.  As I mentioned above, this debt will remain at the Alloy Parent level  and will not be 6 \nadditional debt of ALLETE .  Similarly, in connection with and following the Acquisition, 7 \nthe Partners commit that ALLETE will not lend to the Partners, Alloy Parent or its 8 \naffiliates , nor will the Partners pledge the assets of ALLETE (including Minnesota Power  9 \nutility assets) to secure debt of the Partners .  As explained by Company Witness Anderson, 10 \nMinnesota Power assets will only be used as collateral for first mortgage bonds or other  11 \nCompany  debt. 12 \n 13 \nQ. Will there be some additional debt at the Alloy Parent level?  14 \nA. We expect that Alloy  Parent  will carry some amount of debt in support of its obligations 15 \nto ALLETE’s regulated and unregulated businesses, with the amount to be determined by 16 \nAlloy  Parent  during the availability period of the obtained committed financing.  Any such 17 \ndebt would be held at the parent or holding company level, separate from the Minnesota 18 \nPower utility.  ALLETE (and Minnesota Power) would not be an obligor under such debt, 19 \nand none of the assets of ALLETE (including any assets of Minnesota Power) would be 20 \nencumbered by liens securing such debt  for any entity other than ALLETE  and its 21 \nsubsidiaries .  This is a key component of our ring -fencing commitments that protects 22 \nALLETE and its customers and compliments the low level of debt leverage in the 23 \nAcquisition.   24 \n 25 \nQ. Will the Acquisition lead to reduced compensation for ALLETE employees?  26 \nA. No. As part of the Acquisition, the Partners agreed to provide each Company non- 27 \nbargaining  employee who continues employment as of the effective time of the Acquisition 28 \nwith certain protections (generally for the two -year period following the Acquisition ), 29 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n30 including (1)  the same or better employment position in the same location as held by the 1 \nCompany employee immediately prior to the effective time, (2) a base salary or wage rate 2 \nthat is no less favorable than that provided to the Company employee immediately prior to 3 \nthe Acquisition , (3) aggregate annual and long -term incentive compensation target 4 \nopportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to the Company employee 5 \nimmediately prior to the Acquisition , and (4) employee benefits that are no less favorable 6 \nin the aggregate than those provided to the Company employee immediately prior to the 7 \nAcquisition . The Partners have  also agreed to other customary employee protections, such 8 \nas recognition of pre -Acquisition  service with the Company for benefit plan purposes, 9 \nwaiver of pre -existing condition limitations under post -Acquisition  health plans and credit 10 \nfor deductibles and co -payments under post -closing plans for the year of the Acquisition . 11 \n 12 \nQ. Will ALLETE’s collective bargaining agreements  continue to be honored after the 13 \nPartners become the owners?  14 \nA. Yes.  With respect to each Company employee who is covered by a Company collective 15 \nbargaining agreement , Alloy  Parent will cause the Company  or its applicable subsidiary to 16 \nhonor the collective bargaining agreements  in effect at the effective time of the Merger 17 \nAgreement.  18 \n 19 \nQ. Will ALLETE’s non-bargaining  employee s and their compensation level be retained 20 \nafter the Partners become the owners of ALLETE?  21 \nA. Yes.  The Merger Agreement provides Company non-barga ining employees who continue 22 \nemployment as of the effective time of the Merger Agreement with protections (generally 23 \nfor the two -year period following the Merger), including the employee protections I 24 \nmentioned above.  25 \n 26 \nQ. Will the Acquisition lead to cross subsidy or self-dealing?  27 \nA. No. GIP will benefit from the Acquisition by virtue of ensuring ALLETE remains 28 \nsuccessful and deploys capital consistent with its plans for growth and investment , not by 29 \ncross -subsidization or self -dealing . After the close of the Acquisition, the Commission’s 30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n31 authority over Minnesota Power and its Minnesota operations will continue unchanged, 1 \nincluding protections against subsidization. As evidenced by various commitments 2 \nprovided in the Merger Agreement and Petition, a detailed list of which is provided in the 3 \nPetition at page 20, ALLETE will maintain certain corporate separateness (i.e., “ring - 4 \nfencing”) commitments that will help protect against any risk of cross -subsidization or self - 5 \ndealing.   Company and Partner Witness Lapson also explains the ring -fencing proposed by 6 \nALLETE and the Partners.    7 \n 8 \nQ. Will the Acquisition lead to reduced service quality?  9 \nA. No, the Acquisition will not reduce the quality of service provided by ALLETE or 10 \nMinnesota Power. The Partners recognize that Minnesota Power has been consistently 11 \nfocused on maintaining reasonable costs and a high quality of service for decades, 12 \nconsistent with its ongoing constructive relationships with stakeholders and the 13 \nCommission. The purpose of the Acquisition is not to change the nature or quality of 14 \nservice provided by the utility. Rather, the driving force for the Acquisition is the need for 15 \ncapital that can facilitate future investments necessary to serve customers, not cutting costs ; 16 \ncutting costs  could negatively impact Minnesota Power’s effective operations and high 17 \nquality of service, both of which are key attributes that make ALLETE an attractive 18 \ninvestment.  19 \n 20 \nGIP also recognizes that Minnesota Power, which is the core businesses of ALLETE, has 21 \nan obligation to provide safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers, and that the 22 \nprovision of this service is subject to close regulation by the Commission.  23 \n 24 \nQ. Does the Acquisition reduce or alter the Commission’s oversight authority ?  25 \nA. No.  There is nothing about the Acquisition that reduces Commission oversight or 26 \nregulatory authority , and GIP has no intention of reducing regulatory oversight or seeking 27 \nto modify the regulatory environment in which Minnesota Power operates.  The regulated 28 \nstatus of Minnesota Power was one of the main features of the Acquisition that was 29 \nattractive to the Partners. The regulated nature of Minnesota Power is attractive to GIP 30 \n \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBram  Direct  \n \n32 because it will provide  for a stable stream of returns on the significant investments that 1 \nmust be made in the coming years, subject to appropriate oversight from the Commission. 2 \nFurthermore, the Merger Agreement contains commitments to maintain current oversight 3 \nand as I explained above, t he day -to-day operations of Minnesota Power will be conducted  4 \nby the same individuals operating the business prior to the Acquisition and under the same 5 \nregulatory oversight.  6 \n 7 \nVIII. CONCLUSION  8 \nQ. Please summarize the conclusions of your Direct Testimony.  9 \nA. The Company  need s external equity to fund the unprecedented increase in capital 10 \nexpenditures needed to meet Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard.  The Partners’ long -term 11 \ninvestment goals will provide  the Company  with a reliable source of that equity capital that 12 \nis insulated from the short -term pressures of the public equity market.  The Partners’ long - 13 \nterm goals and priorities, enhanced by their extensive experience with infrastructure 14 \ninvestment in renewable energy, are an optimal match for the Company .  The Partners will 15 \nalso continue ALLETE’s and Minnesota Power’s commitments to their stakeholders and 16 \nwill not cause risks for ALLETE or Minnesota Power.  The Acquisition will position 17 \nMinnesota Power to achieve its long -term goals to comply with Minnesota policy 18 \nrequirements, such as the Carbon Free Standard, while continuing to provide safe, reliable, 19 \nand affordable service to its customers. As a result, the Acquisition is in the public interest 20 \nand should be approved.   21 \nQ. Does this complete your Direct Testimony?  22 \nA. Yes. 23"

OVERVIEW OF C ANADA PENSION PLAN  AND CPP INVESTMENTS  10 \nA. History  and Mission  11 \nQ. Please describe  the history  of the Canada Pension Plan and its  mission and mandate .  12 \nA. The Canada Pension Plan (the “CPP”) was created in 1965 pursuant to the Canada Pension 13 \nPlan  Act (the “CPP Act”),3 which is described in the statute as “ [a]n Act to establish a 14 \ncomprehensive program of old age pensions and supplementary benefits in Canada payable 15 \nto and in respect of contributors .” The underlying goal of the CPP is to help ensure all 16 \nworkers in Canada have a minimum level of financial security in retirement, and to provide 17 \nincome support through disability, death, survivor, children’s , and post -retirement benefits 18 \nfor eligible contributors and their families . The CPP is funded by the contributions of 19 \nemployees, employers, and self-employed persons , as well as revenue earned by CPP 20 \nInvestments . It covers substantially all employed and self -employed people in Canada, 21 \nexcluding Quebec, which operates its own plan . As of March  2024, the CPP has more than 22 \n22 million participating contributors and beneficiaries.  23 \n 24 \nQ. What is CPP Investments  and how is it related to the CPP ? 25 \nA. As noted above, the CPP was created in 1965 and originally was solely funded from 26 \ncontributions of employees, employers , and self -employed persons  to the CPP. As 27 \nCanada’s demographics and economy evolved, the premiums being paid into the CPP 28 \n \n3 Canada Pension Plan , https://laws -lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c -8/page -1.html#h -167616 .  \n4 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  became insufficient to cover the benefits drawn by contributors , jeopardizing  the CPP’s 1 \nability to pay pensions in the long run.  2 \n 3 \nIn 1997,  CPP Investments was created pursuant to an act of Parliament , the Canada Pension 4 \nPlan Investment Board Act (the “CPPIB Act”) .4 CPP Investments invests the funds 5 \ntransferred to it from the CPP that are not currently needed to pay benefits in an effort to 6 \ngrow the CPP fund in the best interests of the CPP contributors and beneficiaries . The 7 \nreturns on those investments are used to fund the benefits provided by  the CPP. Today , 8 \nCPP Investments manages CAD $675. 1 billion in assets, with over 2,000 employees 9 \nworldwide and investments in 56 countries.5  10 \n 11 \nQ. How  does CPP Investments  obtain funds from the CPP ? 12 \nA. The CPP transfers to CPP Investments funds  collected from CPP contributors that are not 13 \nimmediately required to pay CPP benefits . Following the transfer, these  funds are legally 14 \nand beneficially owned by CPP Investments and are invested in CPP Investments’ own 15 \nname and legal capacity.  16 \n 17 \nQ. Please summarize the role of CPP Investments.  18 \nA. CPP Investments is a professional investment management organization . It is not a pension 19 \nfund, pension plan, or pension plan administrator, and was structured to ensure its 20 \nindependence . Its investment decision -making  is overseen by an independent Board of 21 \nDirectors . CPP Investments ’ mandate , the “investment -only mandate ,” is set forth in the 22 \nCPPIB Act , which states that the “objects” of CPP Investments are to: (a) assist the CPP in 23 \nmeeting its obligations to contributors and beneficiaries under the CPP; (b) manage 24 \namounts transferred to it under the CPP Act in the best interests of CPP contributors and 25 \nbeneficiaries; and (c) invest its assets with a view to achieving a maximum rate of return, 26 \nwithout undue risk of loss, having regard to the factors that may affect the funding of the 27 \n \n4 197 S.C. ch.40 (Can.) of 1997, available at https://laws -lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C -8.3/. Note that the CPPIB Act \napplies only to CPP Investments; other Canadian pension funds are governed by separate statutes.  \n5 These figures are as of September  30, 2024 , and therefore differ slightly from those contained in the Petition.   \n5 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  CPP and the ability of the CPP to meet its financial obligations on any given business day .6 1 \nCPP Investments’ investment strategy is informed by the CPPIB Act, its guiding principles, 2 \nand investment beliefs , as I discuss herein  and as described more fully in CPP Investment s’ 3 \nAnnual Report .7 I also describe CPP Investments’ investment -only mandate in more detail 4 \nbelow .  5 \n 6 \nQ. Is CPP  or any Canadian governmental authority involved in the investment decisions 7 \nof CPP Investments?  8 \nA. No. CPP Investments operates independently of the CPP and at arm’s length from both the 9 \nCanadian federal government and Canadian provincial governments . As defined in the CPP 10 \nAct, the purpose of CPP Investments  is to help CPP provide a foundation upon which 11 \ncontributors and beneficiaries can build their financial security in retirement  and to 12 \ncontribute to the financial strength of the CPP by maximizing returns without undue risk 13 \nof loss . Importantly , CPP Investment s’ Parliamentary mandate does not allow for any 14 \nCanadian Government involvement in its decision -making or any secondary policy -related 15 \nobjectives (absent Parliamentary legislation to introduce a change).   16 \n 17 \nQ. Please explain CPP Investment s’ independence from Canadian provincial and federal 18 \ngovernments.   19 \nA. The CPPIB Act establishes a governance model premised on CPP Investments operating 20 \nfree from political interference so that it can effectively achieve its statutory investment 21 \nmandate . The governance system created under the CPPIB Act is recognized worldwide as 22 \na leading standard for national pension plans . The CPPIB Act prohibits  CPP Investments 23 \nfrom making investments for the purpose of implementing, advancing , or promoting 24 \npolicies of any government . CPP Investments may not in any way be directed by the 25 \ngovernment as to which investments it may make . CPP Investments does not submit its 26 \ninvestment strategy, business plan , or compensation policies for government approval . 27 \n \n6 CPPIB Act at §  5. \n7 CPP Investments’ Annual Report is available at https://www.cppinvestments.com/wp -\ncontent/uploads/2024/07/CPP -Investments -F2024 -Annual -Report.pdf . \n6 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Moreover, CPP Investments’ Code of Conduct expressly provides that directors, officers 1 \nand employees shall not allow any of its business activities to be subject to political 2 \ninterference . The CPPIB Act further assures  CPP Investments’ independence, as the 3 \nlegislation itself can only be changed by agreement by both the federal government  and 4 \ntwo-thirds of the participating provinces  that also represent two -thirds of the population.  5 \n 6 \nQ. What is the investment -only mandate?  7 \nA. As discussed above, CPP Investments’ “investment -only mandate” is set forth in the 8 \nCPPIB Act . This mandate  prohibits CPP Investments from engaging in activities other than 9 \ninvesting its assets . CPP Investments and its employees limit their involvement to an 10 \ninvestment management role, for example, by appointing directors and permitting those 11 \ndirectors to prudently exercise their duties as contemplated within the applicable 12 \ngovernance structure . CPP Investments and its employees do not perform the fu nctions of 13 \nthe senior officers or managers and do not otherwise participate in the day -to-day 14 \nmanagerial or operational control of any of the companies  in which it invests .    15 \n 16 \nQ. Is CPP Investments’ approach to investment long -term or short -term?  17 \nA. CPP Investments takes a long -term approach to investing because Canadians will continue 18 \nto contribute to the CPP and draw on their benefits in perpetuity . To ensure that these  19 \ninvestments will be available  in the long -term, Canada’s Office of the Chief Actuary of 20 \nCanada, an independent federal body, asses ses the state of the  plan every three  years . The 21 \nmost recent review, completed in December  2022, concluded that the CPP will continue to 22 \nbe sustainable for 75 years and beyond.   23 \n 24 \nQ. How does the mission of CPP  affect CPP Investments’ overall approach to investing?   25 \nA. As explained above, t he CPP must serve Canadians for many generations to come . As a 26 \nresult, CPP Investments has a longer investment horizon than many other types of 27 \ninvestors . CPP Investments can assess the prospects of its strategies and opportunities over 28 \ndecades, not just over quarters or years . CPP Investments can withstand short -term 29 \ndownturns to create value over the long run, particularly  in contrast to public equity 30 \n7 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  investors,  which often  take a shorter -term approach  to stock price and the need for dividend 1 \npayments . As a result, public equity investors may be more limited than CPP Investments 2 \nin their ability to invest or retain investments where the benefits are expected to be fully 3 \nrealized over a longer -term horizon . 4 \n 5 \nQ. Please describe how private investments fit into CPP Investment s’ strategy.   6 \nA. Private investments play a vital role in CPP Investments’ strategy by providing 7 \ndiversification, long-term growth potential, access to unique investments, alignment of 8 \ninterests, and superior risk -adjusted returns . Private investments help CPP Investments 9 \nfulfill its statutory mandate to maximize returns for the CPP while managing risk and 10 \nensuring the long -term financial security of Canadian retirees.  11 \n 12 \nQ. Please describe how CPP Investments approaches private investments.   13 \nA. CPP Investments takes a comprehensive and strategic approach to private investments, 14 \nleveraging its scale, expertise , and long -term perspective . In particular, CPP Investments 15 \ninvests in a wide range of private assets globally, both directly and with partners like GIP . 16 \nIn contrast to investments made in public companies, private investments are less liquid  17 \nbecause  they cannot be sold readily into established market s, and therefore CPP 18 \nInvestments focus es on earning returns through a long er-term strategy and value creation.  19 \n 20 \nB. CPP Investments ’ Organization al Structure  21 \nQ. Please explain how CPP Investments is organized.   22 \nA. CPP Investments  employs a diversified investment strategy, allocating assets across public 23 \nequities, private equities , fixed income , and real assets  to build a balanced portfolio . The 24 \nAcquisition is managed through CPP Investments’ infrastructure group, which is part of 25 \nthe real assets department . Real asset investments include investments in conventional and 26 \nrenewable energies, infrastructure, and real estate  globally . Reflecting the complex nature 27 \nof its investments , CPP Investments organizes  its investments through subsidiaries and 28 \ninvestment vehicles, as discussed further below .  29 \n 30 \n8 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Q. Does  CPP Investments have a particular focus on  any types of investments or 1 \nprojects?   2 \nA. CPP Investment s’ focus is on  fulfilling its mandate, rather than being  focused on any 3 \nspecific sector or type of project . Over CPP Investments’ 25 -year history, it has generated , 4 \nand continue s to generate , returns by remaining focused on the long term and on building 5 \ndiversified portfolios with robust governance and risk management . To achieve maximum 6 \nreturns without undue risk of loss, CPP Investments’ investments span multiple asset 7 \nclasses  and geographic jurisdictions . This diversification is reflected through CPP 8 \nInvestments’ different Investment Departments , including the real assets  department, 9 \nthrough which the ALLETE transaction  is being executed . CPP Investments’ sector, 10 \ngeographical , and operational expertise  enables such diverse investments , leveraging CPP 11 \nInvestments’ global relationships to identify and access differentiated investment 12 \nopportunities at scale . CPP Investments’  flexibility of capital and legislative mandate 13 \nenable it to invest in the areas of greatest relative value . Engaged management of CPP 14 \nInvestments’ assets and portfolio , including focusing on investments in entities with strong 15 \nmanagement teams,  further enable s CPP Investments  to maximize value creation at all 16 \nstages of the investment life cycle  while respecting the investment -only mandate .  17 \n 18 \nC. CPP Investments’ Experience and Expertise in the Energy Industry  19 \nQ. How does the energy industry fit into CPP Investments’ strategy?  20 \nA. As an institutional investor with a broad global portfolio, CPP Investments invests across 21 \nthe energy sector, including investments related to the energy transition . CPP Investments 22 \nalso has deep expertise across utilities, midstream  energy companies , and energy 23 \ngeneration and has strategically partnered with numerous companies across these sectors.   24 \n 25 \nQ. How do climate -related considerations fit into that approach?  26 \nA. As a long -term investor, CPP Investments consider s sustainability -related factors to make 27 \nmore informed decisions to deliver strong  long-term investment outcomes, in alignment 28 \nwith its legislative mandate.  CPP Investments’ diversified investment strategy affords 29 \nflexibility to invest across asset classes and into all types of climate change -related 30 \n9 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  opportunities . Effective management of sustainability risks and opportunities is one of the 1 \nways companies can preserve and increase their value over the long term . CPP Investments 2 \nrecognizes that climate commitments at various levels of governments represent an 3 \ninvestment opportunity and that its performance will be contingent on the ability of CPP 4 \nInvestments and the companies in which it invests to adapt to those climate commitments.      5 \n 6 \nQ. Does  CPP Investments have  investments in other utilities?   7 \nA. Yes. CPP Investments  holds substantial  investments in utility and energy companies , many 8 \nof which  are in  the United States . For example, CPP Investment s’ portfolio includes 9 \nownership interests in Essential Utilities , Pattern Energy Group LP , and Cordelio Power 10 \nLP. Through these investments and otherwise, CPP Investment s has been involved in the 11 \ndevelopment and upstream ownership of large energy infrastructure projects, including 12 \nrenewable generation facilities and geothermal and battery storage facilities . CPP 13 \nInvestments’ ownership in Cordelio Power LP includes an investment in approximately 14 \n650 megawatts (“ MW”) of wind and solar facilit ies in the Midcontinent Independent 15 \nSystem Operator, Inc. market in the United States . Additionally, through Pattern, CPP  16 \nInvestments  has been involved in the development of significant transmission projects , 17 \nsuch as SunZia Transmission , LLC’s ongoing development  of two approximately 550 - 18 \nmile, single circuit, 500 kilovolt (“ kV”) transmission lines in New Mexico and Arizona . In 19 \naddition, CPP Investments has made numerous investments in regulated infrastructure 20 \nassets both in the United States  and globally . These investments includ e Puget Energy, Inc. 21 \n(“Puget Energy”) (owns Washington electric and gas utility), Essential Utilities  (owns 22 \nPennsylvania water and gas utility) , Transelec SA (Chilean electricity transmission), 23 \nNedgia (Spanish gas distribution), and Iguá Saneamento  (Brazilian water utility) . 24 \n 25 \nQ. Please describe the investment in Puget Energy.   26 \nA. CPP Investments ’ past investment s include a successful  partnership with Puget Sound 27 \nEnergy (“ PSE”), through its parent, Puget Energy,  the largest electric and gas utility in 28 \nWashington state with over 1.2  million customers, through  a take -private transaction . CPP 29 \nInvestments alongside a consortium of financial investor s reached an agreement to take 30 \n10 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Puget  Energy  private at a total cost of approximately $7.4 billion .8 The transaction closed 1 \nin 2009 after receiving all requisite regulatory approvals , including approval from the 2 \nWashington Utilities and Transport ation  Commission  (“WUTC”) . This partnership 3 \nenabled Puget Energy to execute its long -term growth strategy and accelerate its 4 \ndecarbonization efforts.  5 \n 6 \nCPP Investments  was interest ed in Puget Energy for many of the same reasons it is 7 \ninterested in ALLETE . Regulated utilities provide stable long-term cash flows that fit with 8 \nCPP Investments ’ investment strategy to focus on the long -term health of the CPP . A 9 \nsignificant factor in the decision to invest in Puget Energy was the substantial capital plans 10 \nthat Puget Energy needed to fund . Puget Energy would have needed to obtain a very large 11 \namount of funding from the public equity markets to accomplish its capital plans . Doing 12 \nso would have been challenging for Puget Energy because, even though it is larger than the 13 \nCompany , Puget Energy is relatively small compared to other entities seeking capital in 14 \nthe public equity market . CPP Investments was also attracted to Puget Energy due to its 15 \nstrong management team, supportive regulat ory environment  and substantial capital 16 \ninvestment opportunity largely focused on the energy transition.  17 \n 18 \nQ. Describe the performance of PSE during CPP  Investment s’ ownership .  19 \nA. The performance of PSE was strong during CPP Investments ’ ownership  and was  driven 20 \nby a focus on maintaining constructive relationships  with stakeholders  such as  the WUTC 21 \nlow-income advocates, government agencies, environmental groups and labor  groups . PSE 22 \nwas able to successfully manage an ambitious capital investment plan  and continue its 23 \nfocus on employee and customer safety . Under CPP  Investments’  ownership  there was an 24 \nimprovement in key safety metrics . On several important metri cs, PSE saw substantial 25 \nimprovements and outperformed  Bureau of Labor Statistics utility industry averages . In 26 \n2022, after many successful years and substantial benefit for both Puget Energy and CPP 27 \nInvestments , CPP Investments sold its share of Puget  Energy to two other private investors 28 \npursuant to the approval of the WUTC . 29 \n \n8 Unless noted otherwise, all dollar figures are in USD . \n11 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct   1 \nQ. How will CPP Investments’ experience with these prior investments align with the 2 \npublic interest ?  3 \nA. CPP Investments has demonstrated that it is a responsible, experienced investor in, and 4 \nowner of, businesses that provide essential services to customers . Moreover, CPP 5 \nInvestments’ success in investing in major infrastructure entities, and particularly in utility 6 \nand energy businesses, demonstrates that CPP Investments has the experience to be a 7 \nsuccessful investor in ALLETE  and makes CPP Investments a particularly good fit for 8 \nMinnesota Power . In particular, CPP Investments’ experience with its investment in Puget  9 \nEnergy ’s growth and decarbonization efforts gives CPP Investments a unique perspective 10 \nas a financial investor in a company similar to ALLETE.   11 \n 12 \nD. CPP Investments’ Decision  to Invest  in ALLETE  13 \nQ. Please briefly  describe the Acquisition.   14 \nA. The Acquisition  will result in ALLETE going from a publicly  traded company to a 15 \nprivately held company through  a transfer of upstream ownership in ALLETE, including 16 \nMinnesota Power,  to a new entity, Alloy Parent LLC  (“Alloy  Parent ”), created by CPP 17 \nInvestments  and GIP . A merger subsidiary, Alloy Merger Sub LLC , will merge with 18 \nALLETE , with ALLETE  continuing as the surviving entity and becoming a wholly owned 19 \nsubsidiary of Alloy  Parent . As a privately held company, ALLETE will benefit from  20 \nenhanced access to the capital and resources it needs to advance the State of Minnesota’s 21 \nclean energy goals  and the operations, relationships, and strong Minnesota presence of the 22 \nMinnesota Power utility . The overall post -Acquisition organization structure was provided 23 \nas Figure 2 and Attachment A -1 to the Petition.  24 \n 25 \nQ. How did CPP Investments become involved in acquiring ALLETE?   26 \nA. CPP Investments  became involved in th e Acquisition through a structured acquisition 27 \nprocess  initiated by ALLETE . As explained in the Petition, ALLETE’s Board routinely 28 \nconsiders opportunities to enhance stakeholder objectives, including potential sales . In 29 \nMarch  2023, the ALLETE Board engaged with J .P. M organ Securities LLC (“J .P. 30 \n12 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Morgan”) to explore potential buyers interested in purchasing a small - to mid -cap electric 1 \nutility . J.P. Morgan conducted initial outreach to several pension and infrastructure funds 2 \nto gauge interest . On July 1, 2023, representatives of J .P. Morgan met with CPP 3 \nInvestments to discuss the possibility of an acquisition  of ALLETE . CPP Investments 4 \nexpressed interest in the opportunity.   5 \n 6 \nFollowing this initial interest, CPP Investments  met with ALLETE’s  management to 7 \ndiscuss ALLETE’s  strategy, outlook, and capital needs . CPP Investments’ interest in 8 \nALLETE grew quickly as it realized that the business aligned with CPP Investment s’ 9 \nstrategy and portfolio composition goals . CPP Investments was impressed with the 10 \nSustainability -in-Action Strategy , the forward -looking growth strategy, the culture of 11 \nexcellence fostered by management, and ALLETE’s commitment to its customers.  12 \n 13 \nQ. How does ALLETE fit with CPP Investment s’ goals ?  14 \nA. ALLETE is a good investment for CPP Investments because it fits with CPP Investments’ 15 \nstrategic objectives: long -term, stable investments; investments in companies engaged in 16 \ndecarbonization efforts; and investments that will provide an opportunity to deploy capital 17 \nto realize a return on investment for the mutual benefit of the Partners, Minnesota Power,  18 \nand Minnesota Power’s customers.  19 \n 20 \nQ. How  does the investment into ALLETE  support CPP Investments’  goal to select long - 21 \nterm, stable investments?  22 \nA. As I explained above, CPP Investments has a long-term investment strategy, which 23 \ncontemplates that its portfolio include s investments in  regulated utilities and  both 24 \nconventional and renewable energy assets globally . While CPP Investments invests with a 25 \nview to obtaining a return on its capital, as a private investor , CPP Investments is not driven 26 \nby quarterly dividends and earnings reports . As such, CPP Investments can be more patient 27 \nand strategic than investors in the public market.  28 \n 29 \n13 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Further, CPP Investments is able to invest for the long  term for the sustainability of the 1 \nCPP and its beneficiaries . ALLETE represents an attractive opportunity because of the 2 \ninherent long -term duration of utilities and their investment plans . As with any public 3 \nutility, Minnesota Power’s investments are ongoing and long -term and will ensure  safe and 4 \nreliable delivery of essential electric services to customers in their service area . These 5 \ninvestments also include a decarbonization plan that will be executed over the long -term, 6 \nwhich aligns with CPP Investments’ long -term investment goals.  7 \n 8 \nQ. How  does the investment into ALLETE align with CPP Investments’ sustainability 9 \nand decarbonization goals ? 10 \nA. In accordance with its Policy on Sustainable Investing,9 CPP Investments ’ plan to meet its 11 \nsustainability and carbon reduction goals involves both its own operations as well as its 12 \nportfolio . Two of the principles supporting the portfolio goa ls are (i) investing for a whole 13 \neconomy transition and (ii) supporting responsible transition . The goals of companies like 14 \nALLETE align with these principles . Through the Acquisition, CPP Investments will help 15 \nfacilitate Minnesota Power’s  carbon reduction efforts by providing support and capital to 16 \nexecute on Minnesota Power’s plans . ALLETE’s strong management team and its 17 \ncommitment to advancing a sustainable, clean -energy future while delivering safe, reliable , 18 \nand affordable energy services to its customers  aligns with CPP Investments’ investment 19 \ncriteria . A LLETE’s Sustainability -in-Action Strategy and Minnesota Power’s 20 \nEnergyForward  strategy align well with CPP Investments’ vision for regulated utility 21 \ninvestments .   22 \n 23 \nQ. How  does the investment in ALLETE  support CPP Investments’  goals to deploy 24 \ncapital for the benefit of the CPP ? 25 \nA. CPP Investments’ mission is to deploy the capital provided by the CPP for the benefit of 26 \nthe CPP and Canadian citizens . As explained in more detail by Company Witness Joshua  27 \n \n9 CPP Investments’ Policy on Sustainable Investing  is available at https://www.cppinvestments.com/wp -\ncontent/uploads/2024/02/CPP -Investments -Policy -on-Sustainable -Investing -February -2024 -FINAL -ENGLISH.pdf ; \nsee also CPP Investments’ 2023 Report on Sustainable Investing, available at  https://www.cppinvestments.com/wp -\ncontent/uploads/2023/12/SI -Report -2023 -EN.pdf .  \n14 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  D. T aran in his Direct Testimony, ALLETE has a substantial need for capital to fund its 1 \nplans to comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard, and to continue to provide high 2 \nquality service to its customers . This presents an attractive opportunity for CPP 3 \nInvestments to make large investments in stable , well -managed  infrastructure projects  in a 4 \nsupportive regulatory environment . And, as further explained by Company Witness Taran 5 \nand Company and Partner Witness John  D. Q uackenbush, this investment will provide 6 \nbenefits to Minnesota Power’s customers.  7 \nQ. Is CPP Investments’ investment in ALLETE intended to be a short -term or long -term 8 \ninvestment?   9 \nA. CPP Investments views ALLETE as a long -term investment. Given CPP Investments’ 10 \nlong-term strategy, it can enjoy equity appreciation over the long term without needing to 11 \nsell its interest on a particular timeframe .  12 \n 13 \nQ. How  did CPP Investments  decide to partner with GIP?  14 \nA. J.P. M organ introduced representatives of each of CPP Investments and GIP, at the 15 \ndirection of the ALLETE’s Board of Directors, on December  29, 2023 . CPP Investments 16 \nand GIP representatives coordinated and once it became clear that the Partners  shared 17 \ncommon  goals and strategy regarding an investment in ALLETE, we decided to partner 18 \ntogether.  19 \n 20 \nQ. Did BlackRock’s acquisition, which was announced after CPP Investments decided 21 \nto partner with GIP, affect CPP Investments’ view of this investment and 22 \npartnering with GIP?  23 \nA. No. CPP Investments is comfortable that it is aligned with GIP regarding the investment in 24 \nthe Company , and the BlackRock -GIP transaction did not change that.   25 \n 26 \n15 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  E. CPP Investments Post -Acquisition Structure Relative to ALLETE  1 \nQ. Can you provide additional information regarding  the specific entities that will hold 2 \ninterests in ALLETE upon close of the Acquisition ? 3 \nA. Yes. Following the Acquisition, ALLETE will be wholly and directly owned by Alloy  4 \nParent , which will be owned by : (1) 12980037 Canada Inc.  (“CPP Alloy Partner”); (2) 5 \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners V  (“GIP  Fund  V”) and Tower Bridge Infrastructure Partners, 6 \nL.P. (“Tower Bridge”).  7 \n 8 \nQ. Please describe CPP Alloy Partner . 9 \nA. CPP Alloy Partner is a corporation formed for the sole purpose of serving as the CPP 10 \nInvestments entity that will indirectly own ALLETE .  11 \n 12 \nQ. Please briefly de scribe the structure of CPP Investment s’ ownership in ALLETE.  13 \nA. CPP Investments will hold its ownership of ALLETE through several entities . In particular , 14 \nCPP Alloy Partner will be one of the owners, along with GIP Fund V and Tower Bridge, 15 \nof Alloy Holdings GP LLC , which is the general partner  of Alloy Holding s LP. CPP Alloy 16 \nPartner, GIP Fund V, and Tower Bridge will also be the limited partners in Alloy Holdings 17 \nLP. Below is an organizational chart showing CPP Alloy Partner’s relationship to CPP 18 \nInvestments .  19 \n 20 \n16 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Figure 1 . CPP Investments Organization Chart  1 \n 2 \nAs shown, CPP Alloy Partner is wholly  owned by CPP Investment Board Private 3 \nHoldings  (6) Inc., which is in turn wholly owned by CPP Investment Board Private 4 \nHoldings (5) Inc . (“CPPIB (5)”) .10 These entities are each wholly owned subsidiar ies of 5 \nCPP Investments , created to manage certain investments of CPP Investments , including 6 \nALLETE . As wholly owned subsidiaries of CPP Investments, these entities are held to the 7 \n \n10 Under its governing regulations, CPP Investments may not invest in the securities of a corporation to which are \nattached more than 30  percent  of the votes that may be cast to elect the directors of the corporation.  The “30% Rule” \ndoes not limit CPP Investments’ investment in securities (whether equity or debt) that do not carry the right to vote \nfor directors.  CPP Investments is using an appointer structure such that an indirect securityholder (CPPIB (5)), has the \npower to appoint directors.  GIP has adopted a similar approach in order to conform to CPP Investments’ statutory \nrequirements.  As a result, the indirect acquisition by CPP Investments of ALLETE will be compliant with the 30% \nRule.   \n\n17 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  same standards that CPP Investments is held and must conduct themselves accordingly, as 1 \nrequired by the CPPIB Act . Breach of this obligation would constitute a breach of CPP 2 \nInvestments’ governing statute.  3 \n 4 \nQ. What portion of ALLETE will CPP Investments and the two GIP -managed 5 \ninvestment  entities own?   6 \nA. Through Alloy  Parent , when the Acquisition closes : (1) CPP Investments will hold a 40  7 \npercent  ownership interest in ALLETE ; (2) GIP Fund  V will hold a 40 percent ownership 8 \ninterest ; and (3) Tower Bridge will hold a 20 percent ownership interest . More information 9 \nabout the GIP Fund V and Tower Bridge entities is provided in the Direct T estimony of 10 \nGIP Witness  Jonathan Bram.  11 \n  12 \nQ. What  will be the basic governance structure  for ALLETE  after the Acquisition  13 \ncloses?   14 \nA. After the Acquisition closes, ALLETE will continue to exist as the surviving corporation 15 \nunder Minnesota law and will become a subsidiary of Alloy Parent . At that point, CPP 16 \nInvestments and the GIP funds will jointly be the owners of ALLETE . ALLETE will 17 \ncontinue to be directly managed by a Board of Directors , with the Partners expecting to 18 \njointly govern through consent rights .  19 \n 20 \nQ. Is this  governance structure typical for these types of companies and investments?   21 \nA. Yes. It is typical in private investments for  the parties that bear the economic risk  of a 22 \nbusiness’s operations to have the ability to have decision making authority regarding key  23 \ndecisions (e.g., the budgets and business plan adopted for the business, and the execution 24 \nthereof by its officers) . In this case , the planned governance structure is particularly 25 \nappropriate in light of the scope of  capital expenditures needed for ALLETE to meet 26 \nstatutory mandates , and because of the long -term nature of this investment . These factors 27 \nincrease the importance of ensuring CPP Investments is engaged with ALLETE , has a 28 \nvoice in the most important decisions , and can comply with its investment -only mandate.  29 \n 30 \n18 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Q. Will appointment of Board members by the Partners provide benefits to Minnesota 1 \nPower ?  2 \nA. Yes. The Partners’ appointment of Board members will benefit Minnesota Power . The 3 \nPartners will select Board members that can provide a range of global experience in utility 4 \nmanagement to guide the Company . Specifically, the Partners will appoint Board members 5 \nthat have considerable experience and background in Minnesota Power’s major focal 6 \npoints, including capital expenditures, renewable development, and financing a clean 7 \nenergy transition . As explained by Company Witness Jeffery  J. Scissons, the ALLETE 8 \nBoard is currently, and will continue to be, focused on overseeing the Company’s strategy 9 \nand approving the strategic direction of Minnesota Power, including any changes in long - 10 \nterm capital structure, significant transaction s and entry into substantial new lines of 11 \nbusiness . The ALLETE Board is not involved in the day -to-day operation of Minnesota 12 \nPower.  13 \n                     14 \nF. Future Operation of the Company  15 \nQ. Do the Partners  intend to change the way that the Company  operate s? 16 \nA. The Partners do not intend to change how the Company  operate s. To the contrary, the 17 \nPartners have made commitments to maintain the headquarters in Duluth, to maintain the 18 \nCompany’s commitments to its employees and communities, and to maintain the existing 19 \nmanagement team . I will describe these commitments in more detail in this section.  20 \n 21 \nQ. Will the senior management team be retained after the Partners become the owners?   22 \nA. Yes. The Partners have committed to maintaining the ALLETE  senior management team 23 \nafter the Partners take ownership of ALLETE . This commitment is reflected in the Merger 24 \nAgreement  in Section  6.06(b)(i)(5), which provides that ALLETE agrees to maintain the 25 \ncurrent senior management team,  subject to voluntary departures or ordinary course 26 \nterminations.  27 \n 28 \n19 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Q. Why have the Partners  committed to maintaining the existing leadership of the 1 \nCompany ? 2 \nA. The Partners have committed to maintaining the Company’s existing leadership and 3 \nrecognize their demonstrated track record of success . In fact, the quality of ALLETE’s 4 \nleadership team is one of the reasons that CPP Investments was attracted to invest in 5 \nALLETE, and maintaining the team is an important part of continuing that success going 6 \nforward.  7 \n  8 \nQ. Do the Partners anticipate changes in  the current priorities for Minnesota Power  as 9 \na result of the Acquisition ?  10 \nA.  As noted before  and as reflected in the Merger Agreement , CPP Investments  pursued the 11 \nacquisition of ALLETE  because its current priorities are well-aligned with CPP 12 \nInvestments’ own priorities on multiple fronts , including  a commitment to a sustainable, 13 \nclean -energy future  that continues to provide  safe, reliable, and affordable energy services 14 \nto customers; a focus on safety, integrity, community engagement, and employee 15 \ndevelopment; a high-quality management team and employees; and  a well-established 16 \ntrack record and business plan .  17 \n 18 \n In particular, CPP Investments recognizes that Minnesota Power must comply with 19 \nMinnesota’s recently enacted Carbon Free Standard and other existing state policies . The 20 \nopportunity to deploy the capital needed to achieve these goals is attractive to CPP 21 \nInvestments, and CPP Investments  intends  to facilitat e ALLETE ’s compl iance  with 22 \nMinnesota law and policy requirements, including the Carbon Free Standard .  23 \n 24 \n20 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Q. Will authority continue to be delegated to ALLETE management?   1 \nA. Yes, authority will continue to be delegated to ALLETE management, as laid out in the 2 \nMerger Agreement . The ALLETE Board will manage the business and affairs of ALLETE 3 \nand will determine the officers of the Company . The ALLETE  management team will have 4 \nthe authority to directly oversee and manage the day -to-day operations of the business, 5 \nincluding , but not limited to , the implementation of ALLETE’s  annual capital expenditure 6 \nbudgets , managing Minnesota Power , making employee -related decisions, managing 7 \nrelationships and agreements with customers and suppliers,  and ensuring the provision of 8 \nsafe, reliable, and affordable electric service  to its customers . 9 \n 10 \nIV. PUBLIC INTEREST BENEFITS.  11 \nQ. Please summarize the public interest benefits of the Acquisition and the concerns that 12 \nhave been raised   13 \nA. There are two primary public interest benefits of the Acquisition: (i) access to funding ; and 14 \n(ii) access to expertise . I provide additional detail in this section  regarding access to 15 \nfunding, and discuss CPP Investments’ expertise in Section  III. 16 \n 17 \n21 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  A. Benefits of More Reliable Access to Equity Capital  1 \nQ Will the Partners  provide  the Company with  better access to equity capital  than 2 \nALLETE  can access through public markets ?  3 \nA. Yes. As the Company  continue s the transition  to more renewable, cleaner, and increasingly 4 \nreliable transmission, generation , and distribution infrastructure, its need for capital 5 \ninvestment will substantially increase  to fund these many investments that will be required 6 \nto meet  Minnesota’s decarbonization requirements , as explained by  Company Witness  7 \nTaran. As Company and Partner Witness Quackenbush  explains in detail,  the Company 8 \nwould face significant challenges in obtaining the capital needed  for this investment plan  9 \nin public markets . The Partners, who are well-financed private investors, can provide more 10 \nreadily  available capital than ALLETE can access  reliably in the public markets,  which , as 11 \nCompany and Partner Witness  Quackenbush explain,  tend to be subject to unpredictability 12 \nand short -term performance pressures, and to provide less flexible financing arrangements . 13 \n 14 \nQ. Do the Company’s  capital expenditure needs affect the risk of an investment  in 15 \nALLETE?   16 \nA. The Company’s  capital expenditure needs pose both a risk and an opportunity for CPP 17 \nInvestments . As Company Witness Scissons explains, ALLETE’s Sustainability -in-Action 18 \nStrategy  includes an approximately $20 billion capital plan over the next 20 years , and as 19 \nCompany Witness  Taran explains, the majority of ALLETE’s capital needs are driven by 20 \nMinnesota Power, including a five -year capital expenditure projection for regulated 21 \noperations over $4 billion . This level of required investment is indicative of significant 22 \ngrow th potential, which would also benefit ALLETE’s upstream ownership, including CPP 23 \nInvestments . There is a risk that this significant level of investment does not result in the 24 \nexpected level of return, which is a risk for any investment of this scope . The Partners’ 25 \nexperience in investments of this type and scope support s the legitimacy of their 26 \nrisk/reward analysis of the Acquisition, and mitigate s the risk that the ir investment might 27 \nnot progress as expected.  28 \n 29 \n22 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  Q How does the Partners’ long -term focus compare to public market investors in 1 \nutilities?  2 \nA. The long -term focus of the Partners  offers significant advantages compared to public 3 \nmarket investors  for utilities such as Minnesota Power . Public market investors , in contrast, 4 \nfrequently focus on quarterly earnings reports , regular dividends , and short -term financial 5 \nperformance, which may lead to pressure on utilit ies to prioritize immediate profitability 6 \nover long -term strategic investments . This can create challenges for a busin ess, and 7 \nparticularly for one that is embarking on a very large capital expansion plan . In contrast, 8 \nthe Partners’ long-term investment horizon  will allow Minnesota Power to focus on making 9 \nthe investments that are needed without regard to quarterly earnings reports and dividends.   10 \n 11 \nQ. How will the Company’s  access to equity capital be different with the Partners 12 \nrelative to access today in the public equity market?   13 \nA. As discussed above, compared to ALLETE’ s current access  to capital  in the public equity 14 \nmarket, the Partners will be able to efficiently, quickly, and continuously provide the 15 \nCompany with significantly enhanced access to capital without the pressure of short -term 16 \nmarket fluctuations . 17 \n 18 \nQ. To what extent will  CPP Investments  make the capital investments in the Company  19 \nthat are needed?  20 \nA. As explained herein, CPP Investments currently manages CAD $675.1  billion  in assets and 21 \nreceives from the CPP funds collected from CPP contributors that are not immediately 22 \nrequired to pay CPP benefits . The Company’s  planned investments are required to meet 23 \nMinnesota’s Carbon Free Standard . While CPP Investments allocates its funds across its 24 \nentire portfolio  and performs regular portfolio reviews to ensure its funds are appropriately 25 \ndeployed , it recognizes that significant capital investments are necessary to meet 26 \nMinnesota’s  requirements . CPP Investments is pursuing the Acquisition  fully recognizing 27 \nALLETE’s capital plan  and is committed to supporting the Company  in satisfying these 28 \nrequirements . It is through these investments, and ALLETE’s and Minnesota Power’s 29 \n23 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  success, that CPP Investments will earn returns on its overall investment and likewise be 1 \nsuccessful.  2 \n 3 \nQ. What has CPP Investments done to analyze ALLETE’s access to capital needs, and 4 \nhow does CPP Investments view those needs in relation to the Acquisition?  5 \nA. GIP Witness Bram discusse s GIP’s analysis of ALLETE’s access to capital needs, and its 6 \nconclusions therefrom. CPP Investments conducted a similar analysis and generally 7 \nformed similar conclusions, and concurs with Witness Bram’s testimony on this topic.  8 \n 9 \nB. Other Public Interest Benefits of the Acquisition.   10 \nQ. Could ownership by the Partners also provide benefits in relation to ALLETE’s 11 \naccess to debt financing ?  12 \nA. Yes, ownership by the Partners c ould provide benefits for ALLETE ’s access to debt 13 \nfinancing . The Partners ’ networks and relationships within the financial industry could 14 \nopen doors to financing opportunities that m ay not be available to A LLETE  as a standalone 15 \npublic company .  16 \n 17 \nQ How can the Partners’ expertise and focus on renewables benefit  Minnesota Power ?  18 \nA. As explained above  and in the Direct T estimony of GIP Witness Bram , both Partners have 19 \ndecades of experience in renewable energy and bring extensive knowledge and connections 20 \nin the energy sector that will help Minnesota Power meet its clean energy transition 21 \ncommitments . The Partners’  financial strength and history invest ing in large -scale  22 \nrenewable projects , transmission,  and ancillary infrastructure and technology will provide 23 \nthe Company with necessary support and access to capital . The Partners will  be able to 24 \nsupport  the Company in manag ing the financial risks associated with the high up -front 25 \ncosts and long er payback periods typical of large infrastructure and renewable energy 26 \nprojects.  27 \n 28 \n24 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  C. Absence of Risks   1 \nQ. Will the Acquisition  have negative impacts on Minnesota  Power ?  2 \nA.  As CPP Investments has  explained, the Acquisition will simply substitute the current 3 \nowners of ALLETE (its current shareholders) with new owners (the Partners  as 4 \nshareholders ). Ownership by the Partners will provide the benefits of increased access to 5 \ncapital, and access to the expertise of the Partners, as described above . The Partners have 6 \ncommitted that ALLETE and the Minnesota Power utility will continue to operate in a 7 \nsimilar way, under the same management, after the Acquisition, and no negative impacts 8 \nare anticipated for ALLETE, Minnesota Power, or Minnesota Power’s customers.  9 \n 10 \nQ. Will there be negative impacts on the Company  if the Acquisition  is not approved in 11 \na timely manner?  12 \nA. Yes. As explained further by  Company and Partner Witness  Quackenbush, i f the 13 \nAcquisition is not approved, the Company  would be required to obtain the necessary capital 14 \nfrom public markets, with all associated risks and challenges . It may be even more 15 \nchallenging to obtain this capital from public markets during a long pend ency of a 16 \nregulatory proceeding or, worse, immediately after a failed transaction.   17 \n 18 \nQ. Will the Acquisition by the Partners impose significant added  debt on ALLETE or its 19 \nownership structure?   20 \nA. No. The $3.9 billion purchase price is being funded through $3.58  billion of equity and 21 \n$300 million of debt .11 The $3.58 billion of equity is being provided  on the following pro 22 \nrata basis:  GIP Fund V is funding $1.43 billion (40  percent ); CPP Investments is funding 23 \n$1.43 billion (40  percent ); and Tower Bridge is  funding $716.12 million (20  percent ). In 24 \naddition, Alloy Parent has received commitments for a $600 million term loan, of which 25 \n$300 million is expected to be drawn at close in connection with the Acquisition  (as noted 26 \nabove) . The $300 million balance  will be available to fund future capital projects . Alloy 27 \nParent  has also received a commitment for a $100 million revolving credit facility for use 28 \n \n11 The overall Acquisition is $6.2 billion, which includes the assumption of ALLETE’s existing debt.  \n25 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  after the Acquisition closes to assist in supporting future capital needs . This debt will 1 \nremain at the Alloy Parent level and will not be additional debt of ALLETE; nor will 2 \nALLETE (nor the Minnesota Power utility or any of ALLETE’s subsidiaries) be an obligor 3 \nunder these facilities, and therefore they are non -recourse with respect to the Company . 4 \nThis capital will be contributed by Alloy Parent to ALLETE in the form of equity 5 \ncontributions, with debt remaining at the Alloy Parent level. The credit facilities of 6 \nALLETE will not be tied to any credit ratings of Alloy Parent or its affiliates , and no credit 7 \nfacilities at the Alloy Parent level or above would cause cross -default or cross -acceleration 8 \nof ALLETE’s credit facilities. In other words, a failure by the Partners to re -pay the term 9 \nloan and revolver will not directly permit the lender to seek to obtain the assets of ALLETE 10 \nor Minnesota Power or seek acceleration of any ALLETE credit facilities. This amount of 11 \ndebt facility is modest in the context of the overall Acquisition and purchase price.   12 \n 13 \nSimilarly, in connection with and following the Acquisition, the Partners commit that 14 \nALLETE will not lend to the Partners, or to Alloy Parent or its affiliates, nor will the 15 \nPartners pledge the assets of ALLETE or Minnesota Power to secure debt of the Partners. 16 \nAs explained by Company Witness Colin B. Anderson, Minnesota Power assets will only 17 \nbe used as collateral for first mortgage bonds or other debt issued by ALLETE.  18 \n 19 \nQ. Will the Partners  change the financial or business risks of  the Company’s  operations ?  20 \nA. The Partners have no  intention of changing ALLETE’s core operations . To the contrary, 21 \nthe way ALLETE  conduct s its operations was a major factor in CPP Investments ’ interest 22 \nin acquiring the Company . Further, as discussed by Company and Partner Witness Ellen  23 \nLapson  and Company Witness Anderson , the Partners have proposed ring-fencing 24 \nconditions to ensure that  the Company’s  operations remain separate from those of the 25 \nPartners.  For example, while Alloy Parent is expected to carry some amount of debt in 26 \nsupport of its obligations to ALLETE’s regulated and unregulated businesses, ALLETE 27 \n(including the Minnesota Power  utility ) would not be an obligor under such debt, and none 28 \nof the assets of ALLETE (including any assets of Minnesota Power) would be encumbered 29 \nby liens securing such debt for any entity other than ALLETE and its subsidiaries. This is 30 \n26 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  a key component of our ring -fencing commitments that protects ALLETE and its 1 \ncustomers and compliments the low level of debt leverage in the Acquisition.   2 \n 3 \nQ. Will the Acquisition impose on Minnesota Power customers transaction costs, 4 \ntransition costs, or recovery of an acquisition  premium?   5 \nA.  Both Partners have explicitly agree d that t he Acquisition of A LLETE  will not result in the 6 \nimpos ition of  transaction costs or transition costs, or involve the recovery of an acquisition 7 \npremium from  Minnesota Power customers . These commitments ensure that any financial 8 \nburden of the Acquisition will not be passed on to Minnesota Power’s customers so as to 9 \nprotect them from costs associated with the transaction.  10 \n 11 \nQ. Will the Acquisition lead to reduced compensation or job loss for ALLETE 12 \nemployees?   13 \nA.  The Partners have structured the A cquisition to protect the interests of A LLETE  14 \nemployees  to ensur e that employee  compensation and benefits remain intact , provided that 15 \nthe employee remains in good standing . The Partners have committed across multiple 16 \npublic filings that t he Acquisition will not lead to reduced compensation for A LLETE  17 \nemployees . The Partners have committed in the Merger Agreement to maintain the current 18 \nsenior management team and to honor existing collective bargaining agreements and union 19 \ncontracts , to retain non -bargaining  employees at no less than current compensation levels, 20 \nand to maintain benefit levels . Many of the companies in which CPP Investments invests 21 \nhave unionized workforces and, as a long -term investor, CPP Investments has  seen the 22 \nimportance of constructive labor relations in producing positive outcomes for all 23 \nstakeholders.  24 \n 25 \nQ. Will the Acquisition lead to cross subsidies or self -dealing?   26 \nA. No. Cross subsidiz ing operations or engag ing in self -dealing  goes against CPP 27 \nInvestments’ investment approach . There are a number of reasons for this . First, given its 28 \ninvestment -only mandate, CPP Investments does not participate in the day -to-day 29 \noperation of its investments , and accordingly  would not be able to  identify opportunities 30 \n27 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  for, or engage in any type of , cross subsidization or self -dealing . This mandate is the 1 \ncornerstone of CPP Investments’ approach to investment . Second, ring-fencing 2 \ncommitments in the Merger Agreement , such as t he appointment of independent directors 3 \nto the A LLETE  Board  to ensur e impartial oversight  and maintain ing corporate 4 \nseparateness , will insulat e ALLETE  from self-dealing risks . As a first principle, 5 \noperational and regulatory strategies and decisions will continue to rest with management . 6 \nSignificant transactions will require approval processes involving  proposals brought to  the 7 \nALLETE Board on the recommendation of management for approval where necessary , 8 \nwhich will prevent self -dealing and ensur e arm’s length transactions . In addition, even if 9 \neither Partner wanted to engage in self-dealing (which they do not), neither would be able 10 \nto engage in self -dealing without harming the other, and therefore it is in the interest of 11 \nboth parties to serve as a check on the other to prevent any self-dealing . Finally, the Federal 12 \nEnergy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) , the Commission , and the Public Service 13 \nCommission of Wisconsin  (“PSCW ”) all impose and oversee r egulatory conditions that 14 \nwill ensure compliance with regulatory requirements with respect to self -dealing . 15 \n 16 \n Q. Will the Acquisition adversely affect the quality of service provided by Minnesota 17 \nPower ?  18 \nA. No. It is not in the interest of the Partners to reduce service quality . As mentioned above, 19 \nthe quality of ALLETE’s operations  was part of what attracted CPP Investments to the 20 \nAcquisition , and maintaining quality of service to Minnesota Power customers benefit s not 21 \nonly customers, but other stakeholders, including  CPP Investments and GIP, in light of 22 \ntheir long-term investment strategy . The Merger Agreement include s several safeguards to 23 \nensure service quality is maintained , such as the appointment of local representation to the 24 \nBoard and committing to maintain historic levels of economic development and charitable 25 \ncontributions in service territories for five years after closing . A reduction in service quality 26 \nwould be adverse to CPP Investments’ interests and commitments to building and 27 \nmaintaining the long -run success of Minnesota Power . CPP Investments recognizes that 28 \nowning a public utility in Minnesota comes with the obligation to provide safe, reliable, 29 \n28 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  and affordable utility service to customers, to comply with all Minnesota requirements, and 1 \nto be closely regulated by the Commission.  2 \n 3 \n CPP Investments recognizes that providing high -quality service is core to the success of 4 \nthe Company . In order for CPP Investments’ investment in ALLETE to be successful, 5 \nMinnesota Power needs to be successful  and maintain its strong relationships with 6 \nstakeholders and with the Commission . CPP Investments’ incentives are aligned with those 7 \nof Minnesota Power and its customers.  8 \n 9 \nQ Will the Acquisition lead to loss of regulatory oversight?   10 \nA. No. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval from FERC , the Commission , and the 11 \nPSCW . FERC, the Commission , and PSCW will continue to exercise regulatory oversight 12 \nover ALLETE  to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and standards . The Merger 13 \nAgreement  also explicitly includes commitments to maintain regulatory compliance , and 14 \nALLETE’s  governance structure includes provisions for maintaining corporate 15 \nseparateness between A LLETE’ s regulated and unregulated businesses . Although 16 \nALLETE will no longer be subject to oversight applicable to public companies, in its 17 \ncapacity as a public utility,  Minnesota Power  will continue to be subject to the 18 \ncomprehensive regulatory regime governing public utilities.  19 \n   20 \nV. CONCLUSION  21 \nQ. Please summarize the conclusions of your Direct Testimony.  22 \nA. The Company is  in need of access to a significant amount of equity to fund the substantial 23 \nincrease in capital expenditures required to satisfy Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard. The 24 \nPartners have long -term investment goals and are well -positioned to provide the Company  25 \nwith a reliable and stable source of equity capital that is not subject to the same pressures 26 \nthat exist in the public equity market. CPP Investments’ investment -only mandate and 27 \npriorities, coupled with its extensive experience with infrastructure investment and 28 \ndevelopment, are an optimal match for the Company . In addition, CPP Investments ’ 29 \npriorities align with those of the Company  on multiple fronts, including a commitment to 30 \n29 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nAlley  Direct  a sustainable, clean -energy future  that continues to provide  safe, reliable, and affordable 1 \nenergy services to customers . The Partners also do not expect the Acquisition to introduce 2 \nany material risks , and for all of these reasons, the Acquisition is in the public interest and 3 \nshould be approved.    4 \n 5 \nQ. Does this conclude your testimony?  6 \nA. Yes. 7 \nAndrew Alley  \n72 Hudson Drive, Toronto, Ontario, M4T 2K3  \nTel: + 1 416 557 3693  Email: aalley@cppib.com  \n \nEDUCATION  \n \nRichard Ivey School of Business , University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario                                                2007   \nMaster  of Business Administration  - With Distinction   \nDean's Entrance Award  \nDean’s List for academic achievement  \n \nMichigan State U niversity , East Lansing, Michigan                                                                                                 2003   \nBachelor of Arts, Finance - High Honours   \nDean's List  for academic achievement : 2000 -2003  \nAcademic All -Big Ten award for combination of athletics and academics: 2000 -2003  \n \nCFA Institute  2010  \nChartered Financial Analyst Charterholder  \n \nWORK EXPERIENCE  \n \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board , Toronto,  London, Sydney, Hong Kong  2007 -Present  \nManaging Director, Head of Infrastructure, North America & Australasia, Global Leadership Team : Current  \nManaging Director , Real Assets - Infrastructure: Apr il 2016 – November  2021  \nPrincipal, Private Investments - Infrastructure: Apr il 2010 – April 2016  \nSenior Associate, Private Investments - Infrastructure: Oct ober 2007 - April 2010   \n• Leader of North America, Australia, and Asia Infrastructure investment teams  \n• First CPPIB employee to be based in Australia and led the establishment of CPPIB’s Sydney office  \n• Built strategy for Indonesia a s an investment jurisdiction and led CPPIB’s first direct investment in the country    \n• Leadership and continued Board level oversight of CPPIB’s largest investment (407 ETR) and multiple other \nlarge  global infrastructure investments ; significant Director experience across 7 CPPIB portfolio company Boards  \n \nPengrowth Energy Trust , Calgary , Canada                                                                                                              2006   \nFinancial Consultant - Business Development Group   \n• Analyz ed acquisition targets , and provided senior management with recommendations  for suitable transactions  \n• Constructed d etailed analysis of comp etitive positioning within the energy sector  on important financial and \nsustainability metrics to aid senior management in the development of strategic plans  \n \nRBC Capital Markets , Calgary , Canada                                                                                                           2003 -2005  \nInvestment Banking Analyst - Energy Group   \n• Served primary analytical role on deal teams for  lead-managed initial public offerings  and other financings, as \nwell as mergers and acquisitions transactions ; conducted valuation analysis including DCF modeling, merger \nmodeling, comparable companies analysis and precedent transactions anal ysis \n• Analyzed trends in  the financial markets and in  the energy industry, focusing on  conventio nal oil & gas \ncompanies, energy trusts, oil s ands producers, and pipeline &  utility companies ; communicated results to senior \nmembers of RBC Capital Markets and directly to external clients  \n \nACTIVITIES & INTERESTS  \n \n• Full s cholarship athlete on Michigan State track and field and team , and former  Canadian national junior (under -\n20) track and field champion in the 5000 metre run  \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339\nMPUC Docket No, E015/PA-24-198\nCPP-GIP Exhibit ___ (Alley)\nDirect Schedule 1\nPage 1 of 1"

INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ. Please state your name and business address.  2 \nA.  My name is Ann E. Bulkley.  My business address is One Beacon Street, Suite 3 \n2600, Boston, Massachusetts 02108.  4 \n 5 \nQ. By whom are you employed and in what position?  6 \nA.  I am a Principal at The Brattle Group (“Brattle”).  7 \n 8 \nQ. Please summarize your qualifications and experience.  9 \nA.  I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Finance from Simmons College and 10 \na Master’s degree in Economics from Boston University, with more than 25 years 11 \nof experience consulting to the energy industry.  I have advised numerous energy 12 \nand utility clients on a wide range of financial and economic issues with primary 13 \nconcentrations in valuation and utility rate matters.  Many of these assignments 14 \nhave included the determination of the cost of capital for valuation and ratemaking 15 \npurposes.  I have included my qualifications  as MP Exhibit  ___ (Bulkley), Direct 16 \nSchedule 1 to this testimony.  17 \n 18 \nQ. Have you ever testified in any other proceeding?  19 \nA.  Yes. I have testified in multiple regulatory proceedings, including before the 20 \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”). I have included a 21 \nsummary of testimony that I have filed in other proceedings as part of  MP Exhibit 22 \n___ (Bulkley), Direct Schedule 1 to this testimony.  23 \n 24 \n \n2 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  Q. On whose behalf are you testifying?  1 \nA.  I am submitting this Direct Testimony before the Commission on behalf of 2 \nALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power ,1 as well as Canada Pension Plan Investment 3 \nBoard (“CPP Investments”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”).  4 \n 5 \nQ. What is the purpose of your Direct Testimony?  6 \nA.  The purpose of my Direct Testimony is to provide the Commission with 7 \ninformation regarding how the  return on equity (“ROE”) and overall rate of return 8 \ncan be analyzed for Minnesota Power following the acquisition of ALLETE, Inc. 9 \nby CPP Investments and GIP  (CPP Investments and GIP together, the “Partners”) 10 \n(the “Acquisition”) .  I do not make any specific proposals regarding ROE , as this 11 \nis not a cost recovery proceeding.  Rather, I first provide information about 12 \nconsolidation in the energy industry, underscoring that other commissions have 13 \nalso considered transactions and therefore have needed to (and been able to) 14 \nconsider cost of capital determination processes  for utilities post -merger or 15 \nacquisition.  I also provide insight into the reasons  why the established process for 16 \ndetermining  a utility’s  authorized cost of capital  in Minnesota, primarily  via a proxy 17 \ngroup , well -known  ROE models , and comparisons to other authorized ROEs,  will 18 \nbe unchange d as a result of the Acquisition.  19 \n 20 \n Q. Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding?  21 \nA.  Yes. I am sponsoring MP Exhibit ___ (Bulkley), Direct Schedule 1 to my Direct 22 \nTestimony . 23 \n 24 \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Direct Testimony and \nthe Petition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise \nspecifically defined, references to “ALLETE” i ndicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including \nMinnesota Power and all regulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general \nreference to ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n \n3 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  II. CONSOLIDATION AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE ELECTRIC UTILITY 1 \nINDUSTRY  2 \nQ. What is the purpose of this section of your Direct Testimony?  3 \nA. This section of my Direct Testimony d iscusses  the consolidation of the regulated 4 \nelectric utility industry and the expectations of investors  in the regulated electric 5 \nutility industry .  I provide this information as a backdrop for the later discussion in 6 \nmy Direct Testimony of how a utility’s risk and cost of capital is assessed post - 7 \nmerger or acquisition.  8 \n 9 \nQ. To what extent has the industry faced transactions involving the acquisition of 10 \npublicly traded electric utilities ?   11 \nA.  As shown  below, over the past 30 years, the electric utility indust ry has experienced 12 \nsignificant consolidation. In 1995, there were 95 companies classified by Value 13 \nLine as regulated electric utilities. Since that time, there has been steady 14 \nconsolidation of the industry and currently there remain 39 companies that are 15 \nclassified by Value Line as regulated electric utilities. The majority of these 16 \ncompanies are holding companies that are predominantly regulated but do also have 17 \nunregulated operations.  18 \n \n4 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  Figure 1: Number of Investor - Owned Utilities 1995 -20232 1 \n  2 \n 3 \nQ. Is the consolidation in the industry limited to utility company mergers?  4 \nA.  No. Some of these transactions that the Commission has had experience with are 5 \nutility mergers, such as the acquisition of Minnesota Energy Resources 6 \nCorporation ’s (“MERC”) parent company Integrys Energy Group by what is now 7 \nWEC Energy Group, the acquisition of Minnegasco by Reliant Energy, and the 8 \nconsolidation of Northern States Power (“NSP”), Southwestern Public Service 9 \n(“SPS”) and Public Service of Colorado (“PSCo”) into Xcel Energy .  However , 10 \ninfrastructure partners and other investors have been acquiring utility companies 11 \nover this time period.  12 \n 13 \nQ. Please provide examples of utility company acquisitions that are not the 14 \nmerger or consolidation of regulated utility operations.  15 \nA.  Berkshire Hathaway Energy has acquired several utilities over time, specifically, 16 \nMidAmerican Energy, PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power, Nevada Power and 17 \nSierra Pacific Power.  18 \n \n2 2023 Financial Review, Annual Report of the U.S. Investor -Owned Electric Utility Industry, EEI at 33.  0102030405060708090100\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n \n5 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule   1 \nQ. Do investment fund owners consider the risk of utility operations and available 2 \nreturns on equity in their investments?  3 \nA. Yes.  As discussed in the Petition, the Partners bring sector expertise and long -term 4 \ncapital support that can be used to finance the investments in the Company’s clean 5 \nenergy transition. These funds are often focused on investments in certain 6 \nindustries ; in this case, the general  infrastructure investment . However, the purpose 7 \nof the Partners’ investments is to maximize the return on its investments for 8 \ninvestors, commensurate with the risk of the investment portfolio.  Therefore, they 9 \ndo consider the risk of utility operations in setting their expectations regarding the 10 \nreturn requirements for the investment.  11 \n 12 \nQ. What market evidence demonstrates that investment funds consider the risk 13 \nof the utility operations they own?  14 \nA. In his February 2024 letter to Shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive 15 \nOfficer Warren Buffett noted the unexpected risks associated with the regulatory 16 \nrisk faced by the company’s utility holdings through Berkshire Hathaway Energy 17 \n(“BHE”).  18 \nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last 19 \nyear occurred at BHE. Most of its large electric -utility 20 \nbusinesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed 21 \nabout as expected. But the regulatory climate in a few states 22 \nhas raised the specter of zero profitability or even bankruptcy 23 \n(an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current 24 \nthreat in Hawaii). In such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project 25 \nboth earnings and asset values in what was once regarded as 26 \namong the most stable industries in America.  27 \n*** 28 \nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s 29 \nforest -fire losses and can intelligently make decisions about 30 \nthe desirability of future investments in vulnerable western 31 \nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory 32 \nenvironment will change elsewhere.  33 \n*** 34 \n \n6 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  When the dust settles, America’s power needs and the 1 \nconsequent capital expenditure will be staggering. I did not 2 \nanticipate or even consider the adverse developments in 3 \nregulatory returns and, along with Berkshire’s two partners at 4 \nBHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.  5 \n 6 \nWhile I recognize that the source of the performance issues  noted above  related to 7 \nregulatory support surrounding wildfire risk, this summary of the risks of BHE’s 8 \nelectric utility operations, particularly the risk related to regulation , highlights the 9 \nimportance of continued constructive regulation for Minnesota Power.  These 10 \nexamples  also illustrate that while equity and infrastructure fund investors have 11 \nincreased capability to fund energy companies as a whole , particularly where they 12 \nare aligned with the  goals of the underlying company, investors continue to pay 13 \nattention to risk and obtaining reasonable returns on their investment.  14 \n 15 \nIII. ESTIMATING THE COST OF CAPITAL FOR  16 \nREGULATED UTILITIES  17 \nQ. Why is it necessary to estimate the cost of capital for Minnesota Power?  18 \nA. Throughout its history, the Commission has recognized that Minnesota Power is an 19 \noperating division of ALLETE, which has other regulated and unregulated 20 \nsubsidiaries and businesses in addition to the Minnesota utility business. Even for 21 \nutility companies that are traded publicly, it has been common practice to rely on 22 \nmarket data for a proxy group of companies to estimate the cost of equity so as not 23 \nto bias the estimate by a limited sample.  Thus , the ROE for the Minnesota Power 24 \nregulated utility is developed on the basis of a proxy group comparison and 25 \nassociated market data .   26 \n 27 \nFollowing the acquisition of ALLETE by CPP Investments and GIP , this structure 28 \nwill be unchanged .  The Minnesota Power utility  will still be only a subset of 29 \nALLETE and the regulated utility  will still not have market pricing available that 30 \ncould be used to estimate the investor -required ROE  for the Company.  For all of 31 \n \n7 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  these reasons, the determination of Minnesota Power’s authorized ROE  is and will 1 \ncontinue to be  based on estimates  using market data for a proxy group of publicly 2 \ntraded companies . 3 \n 4 \nQ. Please describe the guiding principles to be used in establishing the cost of 5 \ncapital for a regulated utility.  6 \nA.  The U.S. Supreme Court’s precedent -setting Hope  and Bluefield  cases established 7 \nthe standards for determining the fairness or reasonableness of a utility’s authorized 8 \nROE.  Among the standards established by the U.S. Supreme Court in those cases 9 \nare: (1) consistency with other businesses having similar or comparable risks; (2) 10 \nadequacy of the return to support credit quality and access to capital; and (3) that 11 \nthe end result, as opposed to the methodology employed, is the controlling factor 12 \nin arriving at just and reasonable rates.3 13 \n 14 \nQ. Has the Commission provided similar guidance in establishing the appropriate 15 \nreturn on common equity?  16 \nA.  Yes, it has.  For example, in a recent fully litigated case, the Commission cited 17 \nMinn . Stat. § 216B.16, subd. 6, which states that:  18 \nIn determining just and reasonable rates, the Commission is required 19 \nto “give due consideration to the public need for adequate, efficient, 20 \nand reasonable service and to the need of the public utility for 21 \nrevenue sufficient to enable it to meet the cost of furnishing service, 22 \nincluding adequate provision for depreciation of its utility property 23 \nused and useful in rendering service to the public, and to earn a fair 24 \nand reasonable return upon the investment in such property .”4 25 \n In the same Order, the Commission stated that it “must set rates at a level that 26 \npermits stockholders an opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return on their 27 \ninvestment and permits the utility to continue to attract investment.”5 This guidance 28 \n \n3 See generally  Federal Power Com. v. Hope Natural Gas Co. , 320 U.S. 591 (1944);  Bluefield Water Works \n& Improvement Co. v. Public Serv. Comm’n , 262 U.S. 679 (1923).  \n4 In re Petition by Great Plains Natural Gas Co., a Div. of Montana -Dakota Utils., Co., for Auth. to Increase \nNatural Gas Rates in Minn ., Docket No. G0 04/GR-19-511, FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS AND ORDER  \nat 14 (Oct. 26, 2020)  (quoting Minn. Stat. § 216B.16, subd. 6) (emphasis in original).  \n5 Id. \n \n8 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  is in accordance with my view that an allowed rate of return must be sufficient to 1 \nenable regulated companies, like Minnesota Power, the ability to attract capital on 2 \nreasonable terms  on a stand -alone basis . 3 \n 4 \nQ. Is there also academic support for the stand -alone principle?  5 \nA.  Yes.  The well -known and often relied on corporate finance  textbook, Principles of 6 \nCorporate Finance , notes that t he assets of a company should be evaluated as if 7 \neach asset were a “mini -firm” in which investors could invest directly in each asset.  8 \nThe company cost of capital is not the correct discount rate if 9 \nthe new projects are more or less risky than the firm’s existing 10 \nbusiness. Each project should in principle be evaluated at its 11 \nown opportunity cost. This is a clear implication of the value - 12 \nadditivity principle introduced in Chapter 7. For a firm 13 \ncomposed of assets A and B, the firm value is : 14 \nFirm value = PV(AB)= PV (A) +PV(B)  15 \n                       = sum of separate asset values.  16 \nHere PV(A ) and PV(B) are valued just as if they were mini - 17 \nfirms in which stockholders could invest directly.  18 \n*** 19 \nThe o pportunity cost of capital depends on the use to which 20 \nthat capital is put.6  21 \n 22 \nQ. Is determining a fair rate of return just about protecting the utility’s interests?  23 \nA.  No. As the U.S. Supreme Court noted in Bluefield , a proper rate of return not only 24 \nassures “confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, 25 \nunder efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit [but 26 \nalso] enable[s the utility] to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of 27 \nits public duties.”7  As the U.S. Supreme Court further explained in Hope , “[t]he 28 \n \n6 Brealey Meyers Allen, Principles of Corporate Finance  at 214 (10 th ed.2011).  \n7 Bluefield , 262 U.S. at 693.  \n \n9 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  rate-making process . . . involves a balancing of the investor and consumer 1 \ninterests.”8 2 \n 3 \nQ. Why is it important for a utility to be allowed the opportunity to earn an ROE 4 \nthat is adequate to attract capital at reasonable terms?  5 \nA.  An authorized ROE that is adequate to attract capital at reasonable terms enables 6 \nthe utility to continue to provide safe, clean, and reliable electricity service while 7 \nmaintaining its financial integrity.  That return should be commensurate with 8 \nreturns required by investors elsewhere in the market for investments of comparable 9 \nrisk.  It is important to recognize that equity investors , whether investing through 10 \nthe stock market or in a portfolio of privately held businesses,  have a choice of 11 \nwhere to invest capital.  If the authorized ROE is not comparable to the returns 12 \navailable for comparable risk investments, the value to current equity holders is 13 \nharmed and can affect the capital available to the utility.  Where investors are 14 \nfocused on short -term dividends  and earnings, the availability of capital can be 15 \nseverely restricted.  That said, it is reasonable to expect that equity investors will 16 \nseek investment opportunities for which the expected return reflects the perceived 17 \nrisks  and will expect reasonable authorized returns for their investments.  18 \n 19 \nQ. Do Minnesota Power’s operations change as a result of the Acquisition ? 20 \nA.  No. After the Acquisition , Minnesota Power will continue to be the same company, 21 \nwith better access to capital. Minnesota Power is still a local company. The 22 \noperations of the electric utility will continue without disruption or changes in 23 \nMinnesota. Regional employment opportunities at Minnesota Power and the 24 \nmultiplier effect of that employment in the region remains unchanged. Finally, 25 \nMinnesota Power will continue to support local causes as it has throughout its 26 \nexistence, as owned by ALLETE and as a stand -alone entity prior to the current 27 \norganizational structure.  Additionally, Minnesota Power will remain the largest 28 \nsegment of ALLETE, meaning that the health of ALLETE as a Minnesota 29 \n \n8 Hope , 320 U.S. at 603.  \n \n10 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  company, employer, and property tax base  continues to depend heavily on 1 \nreasonable cost recovery and returns in the State of Minnesota.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Does the market -required ROE  invested in Minnesota Power change as a 4 \nresult of access to funds through the Partners?  5 \nA. No. Consistent with the principles of corporate finance, the investor -required ROE  6 \nis based on the risk of the investment, not the source of the capital that is invested.  7 \nThe determination of the ROE is not based on the specific investors or type of 8 \ninvestors ( e.g., institutional investors versus individuals) who will hold an equity 9 \ninterest in the company. This has long been the case, as investors in ALLETE have 10 \nbeen a mix of individuals and institutional investors, with the market -required 11 \nreturn focused on the Company (i.e., the investment).  Therefore, the cost of equity 12 \ncontinues to be based on the risks of Minnesota Power’s operations.  13 \n 14 \nQ. Does better access to capital mean that the return requirements for Minnesota 15 \nPower are lower?  16 \nA.  No. While the Acquisition  will provide better access to capital, investors still 17 \nrequire a reasonable return on that investment.  Further, the Company’s operations 18 \nare predominantly in Minnesota. Therefore, the return that is established by this 19 \nCommission is the largest contributing factor to the return for the Company overall.  20 \n 21 \nQ. What are the financial benefits of the transaction for Minnesota Power ? 22 \nA.  As discussed in the Company’s Petition9 the Acquisition  will provide Minnesota 23 \nPower access to capital to fund its clean energy transition, which requires more than 24 \n$4 billion of investment over the next five years alone. Further, the capital available 25 \nthrough the Partners  will reduce the Company’s exposure to volatility in the 26 \nfinancial markets, and can provide liquidity in tight market conditions when short - 27 \nterm market disruptions would otherwise result in illiquid markets.  These benefits 28 \n \n9 Petition at 13.  \n \n11 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  are discussed in more detail by other witnesses for the Company, GIP, and CPP 1 \nInvestments.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Is it appropriate to review the authorized ROE for Minnesota Power in the 4 \ncurrent Acquisition  proceeding?  5 \nA.  No. A review of just the ROE  without consideration of the other costs of operations 6 \nwould be considered single -issue ratemaking, which is not the process that this 7 \nCommission has used to establish just and reasonable rates. Traditionally , the 8 \nCommission has reviewed the cost of equity and authorized a ROE  in the context 9 \nof a traditional rate proceeding, when all costs of service are evaluated for prudence. 10 \nIt is reasonable to continue to consider the appropriate ROE  in the context of these 11 \nbroader rate proceedings.  12 \n 13 \nQ. Does the fact of the Acquisition change how the cost of equity will be estimated  14 \nfor Minnesota Power  going forward ? 15 \nA. No.  As noted previously, the Company’s cost of equity should be evaluated in rate 16 \nproceedings based on the risk of the investment, which has not changed. The 17 \nAcquisition changes the source of funding, but not the risk of the operation. 18 \nTherefore, it is reasonable to rely on the same methodologies that have been used 19 \nin prior rate proceedings to evaluate the cost of equity for Minnesota Power.  20 \n 21 \nQ. Please explain further.   22 \nA.  Over the past decade, the Commission has  relied on traditional cost of equity 23 \nestimation models , applied to a proxy group of generally risk - comparable publicly 24 \ntraded companies  as one of the key indicators of the cost of equity .  In addition, the 25 \nCommission has historically recognized that it is necessary to evaluate the relative 26 \nbusiness risks of the subject company as compared to the proxy group companies.  27 \nThose estimation tools  do not depend on the owner of the subject company , which 28 \noften itself is not publicly traded as noted above; rather,  they depend on public 29 \ninformation and forward -looking models employing proxy group data.  Thus , while 30 \n \n12 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  ALLETE may no longer be used in other proxy groups,  the Acquisition itself does 1 \nnot change the proxy group to which Minnesota Power  would  be compared.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Has this Commission changed the methodology that it has relied upon to set 4 \nthe ROE for a company as a result of a merger?  5 \nA. No. There have been several acquisitions of utilities in Minnesota that have not 6 \nresulted in any change in the methodology for determining the ROE for the acquired 7 \ncompanies. For example, as discussed previously, Minnegasco was acquired by 8 \nReliant Energy in August 1997. Reliant was transformed into CenterPoint Energy 9 \nin 2002. MERC was acquired by what is now WEC Energy Group  as part of its 10 \nmerger with Integrys Energy Group  in 2015. In both cases, despite the change in 11 \nownership, the Commission has continued to evaluate the cost of equity on a stand - 12 \nalone basis for each of these companies.  13 \n 14 \nQ. Has the Commission established one methodology that they have relied on 15 \nexclusively in setting ROE?  16 \nA.  No. Historically , the Commission placed significant weight on the results of the 17 \nTGDCF model; however, since approximately 2015, while the Commission has 18 \ngiven primary weight to the TGDCF model, it has also considered various other 19 \nfactors, including the results of other models, market conditions, and company risk 20 \nfactors.  For example, in its 2017 Order for Otter Tail Power Company’s (“Otter 21 \nTail”) rate case, the Commission noted that:   22 \nThe record in this case establishes a compelling basis for selecting 23 \nan ROE above the mean average within the DCF range, given Otter 24 \nTail’s unique characteristics and circumstances relative to other 25 \nutilities in the proxy group. These factors include the company’s 26 \nrelatively smaller size, geographically diffuse customer base, and 27 \nthe scope of the Company’s planned infrastructure investments. The 28 \nCommission has also considered Otter Tail’s recognized [sic] the 29 \nCompany’s performance in completing major infrastructure projects 30 \nsubstantially under budget, its history of providing reliable service 31 \nwith stable rates, and its record of effectively serving the needs of 32 \n \n13 \nOAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/ PA-24-198 \nBulkley Direct Testimony and Schedule  its customers, as measured by multiple customer -satisfaction 1 \nmetrics.10 2 \nLikewise, in its 2018 Order for MERC ’s rate case, the Commission acknowledged 3 \nthat the record included a broad diversity of modeling and noted that the authorized 4 \nROE was set in light of the record as a whole:  5 \nThe Commission believes that the record evidence in this case, 6 \nincluding the broad diversity of modeling and expert testimony, 7 \nestablishes a range of reasonable costs of equity, within which the 8 \nCommission must identify one value.  9 \nThe record does not formulaically dictate a particular ROE to be 10 \napproved.  Instead, the record presents a range of reasonable returns 11 \non equity that the Commission has carefully evaluated based on the 12 \nanalyses and arguments in the record. As such, the Commission will 13 \nset the Company’s authorized ROE in light of the record as a 14 \nwhole.11 15 \nThe Commission used a similar approach in its orders for Minnesota Power12 and 16 \nGreat Plains Natural Gas Company (“Great Plains”).13  17 \n 18 \nQ. Has the Commission considered the authorized ROEs in other jurisdictions  as 19 \none data point in setting a Minnesota utility’s ROE ?  20 \nA.  Yes. The Commission has routinely reviewed authorized ROEs in other 21 \njurisdictions in the determination of the ROEs for the companies that it regulates. 22 \nFor example, in its decision in the Company’s 2021 Rate Case, the Commission 23 \nstated:  24 \n[W]hile the decisions of other jurisdictions are not binding and have 25 \nlimited persuasive value because of the fact -intensive nature of cost - 26 \n \n10 In re Application of Otter Tail Power Co. for Auth. to Increase Rates for Elec.

What are your conclusions regarding the estimation of the cost of equity for 7 \nMinnesota Power following the Acquisition ?  8 \nA.  The investor -required return is based on the risk of the investment, not the source 9 \nof funds  and it is reasonable for investors to expect a return on their investment that 10 \nis commensurate with the risk of that investment.  Since the  operations of 11 \nMinnesota Power are not changing as a result of the Acquisition , the investor - 12 \nrequired return is also not changing as a result of the Acquisition . Therefore, it is 13 \nappropriate that the ROE for Minnesota Power be determined as it has been  in prior 14 \nproceedings , considering the risks of Minnesota Power  on a stand -alone basis . This 15 \nis consistent with this Commission’s past practice  determining the cost of equity 16 \nfor other companies that have been acquired or consolidated into larger holding 17 \ncompanies. Further, the methodologies that have been considered by this 18 \nCommission and other regulatory commissions, which include the review of results 19 \nfrom traditional cost of equity models, using proxy groups of publicly traded 20 \ncompanies,  consideration of the relative business risks of the subject company, and 21 \nconsideration of  recent ROE determinations, established in similar market 22 \nconditions  are reasonable and appropriate to review and consider in setting the ROE  23 \nfor Minnesota Power following the Acquisition .  24 \n 25 \nIV. CONCLUSION  26 \nQ. Does this conclude your Direct Testimony?  27 \nA.  Yes, it does.  28 \n \n14 In re Application of Minn. Power for Auth. to Increase Rates for Elec.

INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ. Please state your name and business address.  2 \nA. My name is  John D. Quackenbu sh, CFA,  and my business address is 46320 Station 3 \nRoad, New Buffalo, MI 49117.  4 \n 5 \nQ. By whom are you employed and in what position?  6 \nA. I am employed by JQ Resources , LLC . My current position is President . 7 \n 8 \nQ. Please summarize your qualifications and experience.  9 \nA. I have more than forty years of experience working in the fields of utility regulation and 10 \nfinance.  That experience comprises more than nine years’ service as a utility regulator , 11 \nboth as chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission (“Michigan PSC”) and a  12 \nfinance staff member  of the Illinois Commerce Commission (“ICC”) , more than two 13 \ndecades of work in and with the capital markets for regulated entities , competitive firms,  14 \nand a leading global financial services firm, and, most recently, consulting with 15 \nregulators and regulated entities concerning capital market and utility finance issues.   16 \n 17 \nI have served as the President of JQ Resources, LLC since April 2016.  My primary 18 \nresponsibilities in that role include providing professional advice and education to 19 \nparticipants in the regulated utility industries through consulting services that bridge the 20 \ngap between the regulatory and investment communities.  In that role, I am retained by 21 \nand my services are used by regulators, regulatory organizations, regulated entities, and 22 \nother stakeholders in the regulatory process.  Recently, for example, on behalf of the 23 \nNational Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners ( “NARUC ”), I authored two 24 \ntariff toolkit primers, the April 2020 tariff toolkit primer entitled “A Cost of Capital and 25 \nCapital Markets Primer for Utility Regulators,” and the April 2021 “Primary Drivers of 26 \nElectricity Tariffs for Utility Regulators ,” which have been used to support NARUC 27 \n \n 3 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  training activities internationally.1  I also continue to monitor how investors perceive 1 \nand evaluate utility investment opportunities and risks, and to interact with and stay 2 \nabreast of the views of credit rating agencies, buy -side institutional investors, and sell - 3 \nside analysts focusing on the utility sector.   4 \n 5 \nAs a regulator, I served as the Chair of the Michigan PSC.  In that position, I was charged 6 \nwith both setting policy and evaluating evidence of the full range of regulatory issues, 7 \nincluding concerning utility finance, access to capital, and the cost of that capital.  While 8 \nChair of the Michigan PSC, I served on the NARUC Committee on Gas, its Committee 9 \non Consumer Affairs, and its Subcommittee on Pipeline Safety during 2011 through 10 \n2016.  11 \n 12 \nAs a member of the ICC staff, including as its Chief Financial Analyst, I advised the 13 \nCommission concerning finance issues.  Among my roles was supporting the 14 \nCommission in the determination of utility cost of capital and assessing the methods by 15 \nwhich the Commission could gain accurate insight into capital costs and the factors that 16 \naffect them , including through the use of cost of capital models.  17 \n  18 \nI was employed for 11 years by UBS Global Asset Management (“UBS”), an affiliate 19 \nof a leading international investment bank, where I led the global utilities team in 20 \nbuilding utility equity portfolios.  In that role, I covered approximately 80 North 21 \nAmerican companies, including approximately 60 to 65 regulated utilities at any time, 22 \nand met regularly with their senior management, customers, suppliers, and regulators.  23 \nI was primarily responsible for investment recommendations, thesis statements, and 24 \nfinancial models for any utility investment that was selected for  U.S. or Canadian 25 \ndomestic equity portfolios, as well as global equity portfolios. I also regularly interacted 26 \n \n1  NARUC “A Cost of Capital and Capital Markets Primer for Utility Regulators,” April 2020 , available at  \nhttps://pubs.naruc.org/pub.cfm?id=CAD801A0 -155D -0A36 -316A -B9E8C935EE4D ; NARUC “Primary \nDrivers of Electricity Tariffs for Utility Regulators,” April 2021 , available at  \nhttps://pubs.naruc.org/pub.cfm?id=5AF87EC9 -155D -0A36 -31A2 -6ACF453362F4 .  These primers are two of a \nseries of primers in NARUC’s Cost -Reflective Tariff Toolkit focusing on the regulator’s role achieving cost -\nreflective tariffs.  \n \n 4 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  with utility sell -side analysts who research and publish reports on electric , natural gas, 1 \nand water utility equities and with utility buy -side analysts who were my peers and 2 \ncompetitors.  3 \n 4 \nFinally, I have 14 years’ experience performing regulatory and treasury functions for 5 \nSprint Corporation (“Sprint”), spanning the period during which local exchange carriers 6 \nwere subject to cost -of-service regulation and the transition to price cap regulation.  At 7 \nSprint, I prepared risk -adjusted cost of capital estimates used for capital investment, 8 \nvaluation, mergers and acquisitions, strategic decision -making, and product/service 9 \ncosting analysis across divisions , including more than 2 2 regulated local exchange 10 \ncarriers ( “LECs ”) operating in more than 17 states, as well as the competitive long 11 \ndistance and wireless divisions .  United Telephone Company of Minnesota (later 12 \nrenamed Sprint – Minnesota) based in Chaska was  one of the LECs.  I was also 13 \nresponsible for managing Sprint’s parent and subsidiary relationships with four credit 14 \nrating agencies, providing the quantitative and qualitative information required by the 15 \nrating agencies, and assessing and analyzing how those rating agencies differentiated 16 \nrisk among different companies and subsidiaries of the parent company.  During this 17 \ntime, I served as Treasurer for United Telephone Company of Ohio, and the Central 18 \nTelephone Company ( a multi -state LEC operating in North Carolina and Nevada).  I 19 \nalso regularly interacted with credit rating agency analysts that published credit rating 20 \nresearch reports along with corporate financial professionals who were my peers at other 21 \nregulated and competitive firms.  22 \n 23 \nI have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Economics from Calvin College and a 24 \nMaster of Business Administration degree with a concentration in Finance from 25 \nMichigan State University.  I am a Chartered Financial Analyst (“CFA”) and a member 26 \nof the CFA Institute and the CFA Society of Chicago.  27 \n 28 \nMy resume  provid ing more comp lete detail is attached as MP Exhibit ___ 29 \n(Quackenbush ), Direct Schedule 1 . 30 \n 31 \n \n 5 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  Q. Have you testified in any other proceeding s? 1 \nA. Yes, I have testified as an expert witness before the Federal Energy Regulatory 2 \nCommission (“FERC”) and several state regulatory commissions including the Arizona 3 \nCorporation Commission, the Florida Public Service Commission , the Illinois 4 \nCommerce Commission, the Kansas Corporation Commission, the Missouri Public 5 \nService Commission, the Montana Public Service Commission, the Nevada Public 6 \nService Commission, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the North Carolina 7 \nUtilities Commission, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the Oregon Public 8 \nUtility Commission, the South Carolina Public Service Commission, the Tennessee 9 \nPublic Service Commission, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, and the Public 10 \nService Commission of Wisconsin.   My summary of expert witness proceedings is 11 \nattached as MP Exhibit ___ (Quackenbush ), Direct Schedule 2 : Summary of 12 \nProceedings.  13 \n 14 \nQ. What is the purpose of your Direct Testimony ? 15 \nA. The purpose of my Direct Testimony  is to provide perspective on  debt and equity capital 16 \nmarkets, the access of investor -owned utilities  (“IOUs”) to the capital markets , and the 17 \npotential impact o f the Acquisition by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP 18 \nInvestments ) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) (together, the  “Partners”) on  19 \nALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.2 20 \n 21 \nQ. Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding?  22 \nA. Yes. I am sponsoring the following schedules to my Direct Testimony:  23 \n• MP Exhibit ___ (Quackenbush ), Direct Schedule 1 : Statement of Qualifications;  24 \n• MP Exhibit ___ ( Quackenbush ), Direct Schedule 2 : Summary of Proceedings;  25 \nand 26 \n \n2 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Direct Testimony and the \nPetition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically \ndefined, references to “ALLETE” i ndicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota \nPower and all regulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power . \n \n 6 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  • MP Exhibit ___ ( Quackenbush ), Direct Schedule 3: EEI 2023 Financial Review 1 \nTable of U.S. Investor -Owned Electric Utilities  Market Capitalization . 2 \n 3 \nQ. How is your Direct Testimony organized?  4 \nA. First,  I describe capital markets , the difference between debt and equity, the difference 5 \nbetween public and private capital,  and access to capital issues for regulated utilities . 6 \nThen, I describe how those capital markets principles and access to capital issues apply 7 \nto the proposed acquisition of ALLETE by the Partners (the “Acquisition”) in this 8 \nproceeding . 9 \n 10 \nQ.  Please summarize  your Direct Testimony . 11 \nA.  Capital market access is important to regulated utilities and is even more important to 12 \nALLETE given its small size and outsized capital spending plan that is necessary to 13 \nenable Minnesota Power to achieve Minnesota state policy goals.  The proposed private 14 \nequity transaction is an ideal fit for ALLETE’s capital requirements.  In turn, Minnesota 15 \nPower customers will benefit from a financially healthy utility.  Private equity is 16 \nuniquely positioned to support long -term infrastructure investment and enhance 17 \nALLETE’s access to capital and its ability to achieve carbon reduction standards in 18 \nMinnesota .   19 \n 20 \nII. THE PETITION  21 \nQ. Have you reviewed the Petition and other filings made to date by Minnesota Power 22 \nand the Partners in this proceeding ? 23 \nA. Yes. I have reviewed the Petition; the Merger  Agreement ; the August  26, 2024 Reply 24 \nComments, the October 8, 2024 Supplement al Filing , and comments filed by 25 \nintervening parties to date.  26 \n 27 \n \n 7 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  III. THE IMPORTANCE OF CAPITAL MARKET  ACCESS TO UTILITIES  1 \nA. Common Goals of Utilities and Regulators  2 \nQ. Do utility regulators and utilities share common goals?  3 \nA. Yes. Both utilities and regulators want to ensure affordable and fair bills for customers, 4 \nreliable and safe service, a positive customer experience, and a transition to clean 5 \nenergy.  Customers are at the center of all four of these goals.  Regulators work toward 6 \nthese goals through their policies, rules, and orders.  Utilities contribute toward 7 \nmeeting these goals by investing in infrastructure, efficiently raising capital, and 8 \ncontrolling O&M costs.  Infrastructure investment is particularly important to 9 \nachieving the goals of enhancing reliability by replacing aging infrastructure and 10 \ninvesting in new customer -facing and clean technologies.   11 \n 12 \nCustomers have grown accustomed to reliable and safe electricity being available on 13 \ndemand with minimal service disruptions.  Many customers are also interested in 14 \nelectric ity that is produced with lower carbon and other emissions .  Utilities must 15 \ninteract with the capital markets regularly to raise capital to obtain the funds for new 16 \ninfrastructure investment as well as re -finance maturing debt.  Customers benefit if 17 \nutilities are able to obtain capital at reasonable and cost -effective rates, resulting in 18 \naffordable and reasonable  bills for service provided to customers . 19 \n 20 \nB. The Role of Capital Markets in Serving Customers  21 \nQ. Why are capital markets important for regulated utilitie s, their regulators, and 22 \ntheir customers ? 23 \nA. Regulated utilities are required to raise capital from investors in order to provide safe, 24 \nreliable, and affordable service to customers , and meet public policy objectives .  Utility 25 \nservice is provided through investments in infrastructure that is constructed to last for 26 \nmultiple decades, which makes utilities among the most capital -intensive industries.  27 \nInvestors supply capital to a utility  to pre -fund utility work that serves customers,  with 28 \n \n 8 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  investors then having the appropriate  expectation of earning a return  on their 1 \ninvestments .  Although utilities provide public information about their plans, goals, and 2 \nprojects, investors provide capital to  the utility company rather than for individual 3 \nprojects.  Specifically, i nvestors require a return on an investment in relation to the risk 4 \nof that utility , which includes  a portfolio of individual projects and workstreams .  In 5 \nturn, u tility customers pay bills for utility service that include a component to provide 6 \nfor the recovery of the utility’s cost of obtaining capital.  7 \n 8 \nQ. Why is the access to capital markets important for regulated utilities, their 9 \nregulators, and their customers?  10 \nA. Regular sustained access to the capital markets is important because regulated utilities 11 \nmust continually invest in infrastructure that supports the continued provision of safe, 12 \nreliable, affordable, and clean service at the time customers demand it.  A financially 13 \nhealthy utility will have access to capital, which includes the availability of capital and 14 \nthe cost of that capital.  The more capital intensive an industry is, and the more frequent 15 \ncapital raising needs are, the more important is the access to capital.   16 \n 17 \nQ. Are utilities guaranteed access to capital in the public markets?  18 \nA. No.  Investors have a choice of competing investments and they make their selections 19 \nby weighing risks versus returns.  Capital markets are global, with investments 20 \ncompeting against alternatives across the world on a risk -adjusted basis, and capital 21 \nflows to investments that provide attractive risk -adjusted returns.  Investment 22 \nopportunities in utilities – or any other company, for that matter – that do not provide 23 \nsufficient risk -adjusted returns will not attract capital.  Even within a company or 24 \nholding company family, capital allocation is a process that must take risk-adjusted  25 \nreturns into consideration.  Over time, a utility or holding company will have no choice 26 \nbut to direct capital to the activities, divisions, or jurisdictions that provide appropriate 27 \nrisk-adjusted returns that recognize the market cost of that capital.   28 \n \n 9 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules   1 \nQ. Please describe and compare debt and equity capital markets.  2 \nA. There are two primary types of capital: debt and equity.  A debt investor essentially 3 \nlends debt capital to the utility and expects to receive periodic interest payments and the 4 \nreturn of principal at the end of the life of the debt security.  In contrast, an equity 5 \ninvestor acquires stock which represents an ownership interest in a utility and expects 6 \nto receive periodic dividend payments and stock price appreciation upon selling the 7 \nstock.  In general, an equity investment is considered of higher risk than a debt 8 \ninvestment , and therefore requires a higher return.   Debt holders have a higher claim  on 9 \nthe assets of a company and will be paid before share holders in the event of bankruptcy.   10 \nShare holders are last in line to be paid, after debt holders and other creditors.  11 \n 12 \nBoth debt and equity securities are traded in the capital markets.  Alternative capital 13 \ninvestments are evaluated by investors on their individual merits and risk metrics.  Debt 14 \nis issued by a utility into the primary debt market, after which it may be traded in the 15 \nsecondary market where its market value will change as fundamental factors such as 16 \ninterest rates , perceived risk s, and credit ratings  change .  Public e quity is issued by a 17 \nutility into the primary equity market, after which it will be traded in the secondary 18 \nmarket on a stock exchange where its market value will fluctuate over time in response 19 \nto supply and demand , fundamental factors such as perceived company -specific risk 20 \nchanges and economic conditions , market sentiment , and technical factors.  It is 21 \ntypically expected that a utility’s stock price will be more volatile than its debt prices.    22 \n 23 \nQ. Do customers benefit from a financially healthy utility?  24 \nA. Yes.  A financially healthy utility can attract capital at a more cost -effective rate than 25 \na financially weak utility.  Customers, not just investors, benefit by having a 26 \nfinancially stable utility that has the earnings and cash flow sufficient to attract equity 27 \nand debt on reasonable terms, and the ability to provide safe, reliable electric service.  28 \nHaving a reasonable authorized return on equity  and regulatory adjustment 29 \nmechanisms to recover costs in a timely manner are important contributor s to financial 30 \nstability.  The long-term customer benefits that result from being served by a 31 \n \n 10 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  financially healthy utility outweigh the illusory short -term “benefits” of artificially 1 \nlower customer rates that produce a negative regulatory climate that heightens 2 \nregulatory risk  and weakens financial health . 3 \n 4 \nQ. How do customers benefit from a financially healthy utility?  5 \nA. Utilities require reliable access to the capital markets at reasonable cost in order to 6 \nsupport and maintain that investment if they are to serve their customers effectively.  7 \nInvestors, in turn, supply capital with the expectation of earning a return on their 8 \ninvestment, and they require a return proportional to the risk of their investment.  A 9 \nfailure to honor investor requirements will, counterproductively, leave the utility 10 \nunable to secure capital at a reasonable competitive cost, can increase its perceived 11 \nfinancial risk, and will ultimately increase its costs and make provision of service to 12 \ncustomers more difficult.  Because customers have a strong interest in ensuring that 13 \nutilities can raise the capital required for safe, reliable, clean, and affordable service, 14 \ntheir interest in receiving service at a reasonable cost is not well -served by a financially 15 \nweak utility with limited access to capital.  16 \n 17 \nThe risks faced by utility investors are important to utility customers.  As discussed in 18 \nthe NARUC Cost of Capital and Capital Markets Primer for Utility Regulators:3 19 \nThe risks faced by utility investors are important to utility customers 20 \nbecause risks to investors get reflected in the capital costs to the utility 21 \nwhich are ultimately paid for by customers.  Regulatory risk as 22 \nperceived by investors impacts the availability and cost of capital.  23 \nWhen investors perceive higher risk, the corresponding costs of debt 24 \nand equity increase.  If investors are les s willing to provide capital, 25 \ncapital is less cost -effective for customers.   26 \n 27 \nIt is clear that t he risk levels of a  regulated utility  impact its cost of obtaining capital.   28 \nFor example, a heightened level of risk would place upward pressure on its cost of 29 \nshort -term debt and its embedded cost of long -term debt, since  new long -term debt 30 \nsecurities would be issued at higher interest rates.  Moreover, revolving credit facilit ies 31 \noften  immediately re -price upward to higher interest rates, as heightened risk is  tied to 32 \n \n3 NARUC “A Cost of Capital and Capital Markets Primer for Utility Regulators,” April 2020, at 9. \n \n 11 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  higher credit spreads.  Also, elevated risk  may impact the amount of unsecured credit 1 \nextended by natural gas and wholesale power counterparties as well as their collateral 2 \ndemands.  Additionally, the utility ’s cost of equity would increase as equity investors 3 \nwould require a higher rate of return to compensate for additional risk.    4 \n 5 \nIt is often said that the role of conventional cost -of-service regulation is to “balance” 6 \nthe interests of utility customers and utility investors.  However, that balance is not 7 \nalways a seesaw where actions in the interest of one are to the detriment of the other.  8 \nIn many ways, the interests of investors and customers are aligned and not in conflict.  9 \nAs mentioned in the NARUC Cost of Capital and Capital Markets Primer  for Utility 10 \nRegulators :4 11 \nUtility management has a fiduciary responsibility to deploy investors’ 12 \ncapital productively.  Investors recognize the importance of regulatory 13 \nand stakeholder relationships and expect utility management to provide 14 \nsafe, reliable, and affordable service to customers in order to preserve 15 \nand enhance the value of their invested capital.  In many ways, the 16 \ninterests of investors and customers are aligned and not in conflict and 17 \ncan become more aligned through regulatory policy.  Regulators are 18 \nmore effective at serving customers when they harness investors’ desire 19 \nto provide capital rather than constrain it.  20 \nCustomers expect that the utility will make and support the investments necessary to 21 \nprovide adequate, safe, and reliable service and do so with reasonably priced capital 22 \nin the short and long  run.  The interests of investors and customers are aligned through 23 \nregulatory practices that accurately assess utility risks and capital costs and reflect 24 \nthose determinations, consistently, in rates.  25 \n 26 \nMoreover, an additional benefit of utility  investment is the enhanced quality of life 27 \nthat inures to the communities in a utility’s service territory from economic 28 \ndevelopment and job creation.  29 \n 30 \n \n4 NARUC “A Cost of Capital and Capital Markets Primer for Utility Regulators,” April 2020, at 9. \n \n 12 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  Q. Please describe and compare public and private capital markets . 1 \nA. The public capital markets refer to  markets for  securities that are publicly traded or 2 \nlisted on an exchange .  Specific  to equity investments , public equity refers to stocks 3 \nthat are publicly traded or listed on a stock exchange.  In the utility industry, companies 4 \nthat are public equity  owned are often referred to as investor -owned utilities.  MP 5 \nExhibit ___ ( Quackenbush ), Direct Schedule 3 shows a list of U.S. investor -owned 6 \nelectric utilities at December 31, 2023 as identified by the Edison Electric Institute 7 \n(“EEI”). Public equity utility investors include a mix of long -term and short -term 8 \ninvestors.  Long -term utility investors generally seek the lower risk attributes of low 9 \nvolatility, stability, certainty, and predictability, along with modest returns and are 10 \nfocused on fundamental factors  that drive equity valuations over the long run .  11 \nALLETE , including action on behalf of its utility operations,  compete s for capital in a 12 \nglobal securities market and particularly against other long -term stable investment like 13 \nother North American utilities.  Investors in ALLETE long-term debt and equity  14 \ninclude large institutional investors that invest on behalf of public employee pension 15 \nfunds, teacher pension funds, and mutual funds, as well as ordinary Americans 16 \ninvesting in their 401k accounts and individual Minnesotans such as those represented 17 \nby the grassroots Minnesota Utility Investors Association.  Institutional investors 18 \nincorporate ALLETE long-term debt and  stock into the retirement accoun ts of many 19 \nordinary Americans.   20 \n 21 \nLong -term utility debt investors expect regular interest payments and repayment of 22 \ncapital at maturity.  Long -term utility equity investors expect dividend payments and 23 \nmodest capital appreciation at a future sale date in line with other long -term stable 24 \ninvestments.  Neither long-term utility debt nor equity investors are seeking  volatility 25 \nor outsized returns, since there are sectors other than utilities to invest in if that is the 26 \ninvestor’s goal.  Other  non-utility  sectors regularly earn returns greater than their cost 27 \nof capital.   Long -term equity investors are likely to use fundamental valuation models 28 \nthat focus on earnings, cash flows, dividends, growth, and discount rates.  Efficient 29 \nmarkets imply that long -term equity prices will gravitate toward fundamental 30 \nvaluations.  31 \n \n 13 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules    1 \nQ. Please contrast the impact of short -term equity investors and long -term equity 2 \ninvestors.  3 \nA.  Short -term equity investors in the public markets may include hedge funds  and short 4 \nsellers  who are more interested in short -term stock price movements than long -term 5 \nfundamentals .  Significant transactional activity by short -term investors m ay lead to 6 \ntemporary valuation disruptions away from long-term fundamentals.   At times, these 7 \ntemporary valuation  disruption s can persist for noticeable periods of time.  A n equity 8 \nissuer can  be inconvenienced if it needs to raise equity capital during a valuation 9 \ndisruption.  A serial equity issuer can be seriously hampered during valuation 10 \ndisruptions because it has less control over issuance timing  and may have no choice but 11 \nto issue shares at a disadvantageous price , potentially raising less capital than needed .  12 \nA non-serial equity issuer  can more readily wait through a valuation disruption and time 13 \nthe market for a higher valuation, thus raising the amount of capital it needs.    14 \n 15 \nIn contrast, p rivate equity investing is investing in shares of companies that are not 16 \npublicly traded or listed on a stock exchange.   Private equity is stock in a private 17 \ncompany that does not offer stock to the general public.  Typically, a private equity fund 18 \ndevelops specific financial goals, management preferences, and investment strategies.  19 \nOften , the investment strategy focuses  on the long -term growth and expansion of the 20 \nacquired companies.  Private equity  often raises investment funds from institutional 21 \ninvestors such as pension funds , infrastructure funds, and ultra -high-net-worth 22 \nindividuals to pursue a stated long-term investment strategy.  Private market long-term 23 \nutility investors also generally seek the lower risk attributes of low volatility, stability, 24 \ncertainty, and predictability, along with modest returns.  Like long term -public market 25 \ninvestors, t hey would look toward other non -utility sectors if their goal was outsized 26 \nreturns.   An issuer that has access to private equity has no exposure to temporary 27 \nvaluation disruptions caused by short -term investors.  28 \n 29 \n \n 14 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  Q. How can other exogenous factors such as market volatility, technical factors , and 1 \nmarket sentiment influence the public equity market?  2 \nA. Markets can be volatile  during unstable times.  Utilities need to prepare as if market 3 \nvolatility may be  imminent because of the potentially severe consequences of swings in 4 \nspreads and limitations on access to capital.  Capital market access may be diminished 5 \nor severely restricted during times of crisis, such as the 2008 global financial crisis or 6 \nthe COVID -19 pandemic impact on the commercial paper market in March 2020.  Debt  7 \nsecurities are typically priced as a spread to comparable -maturity U.S. Treasury 8 \nsecurities.  Long -term spreads also widen during a crisis with lower credit quality issuers 9 \nhaving to accept a larger spread differential compared to higher credit quality issuers 10 \nthan typical during stable times.  Moreover, in unstable markets, investor sensitivity to 11 \ninstability in the utility’s financial condition, or its regulation, is typically greater.  12 \nQuarterly earnings reports, news reports, and regulatory decisions can all impact the 13 \ntiming of public capital issuance if they create unfavorable periods of time for issuance.  14 \n 15 \nTechnical factors can also alter the supply of and demand for a company’s stock.  For 16 \nexample, a large investor might buy or short a stock as a hedge against another 17 \ninvestment.  This hedging activity can alter the demand for the stock, thus altering the 18 \nobserved public market valuation for technical, rather than fundamental, reasons.  19 \nChanging investor demographics, short -term momentum trends, and liquidity 20 \nconstraints can all impact stock valuations at any point in time.  21 \n 22 \nMarket sentiment  refers to the individual and collective psychology of market 23 \nparticipants .  Some stocks appear to be mispriced by the public market for noticeable 24 \nperiods of time for no discernable reason based on fundamentals.  The relatively new 25 \nfield of b ehavioral finance  is exploring this observed phenomenon .   26 \n 27 \nQ. How is private  equity  uniquely positioned to support long -term infrastructure 28 \ninvestment  and enhance access to capital ? 29 \nA. Private equity is typically long -term focused  and more patient , in contrast to the public 30 \nequity market consisting of a mix of long -term and short -term investors.  Although 31 \n \n 15 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  public equity  valuations will fully reflect fundamental factors in the long run in the 1 \nefficient market , potential negative impacts of other factors related  to short -term 2 \nvaluation disruptions , market volatility, technical factors, and market sentiment  are also 3 \navoided  with private equity .  An o ccasional  issuer of moderate to large size can perhaps 4 \nnavigate more nimbly through an adverse environment, but a serial issuer  assumes more 5 \nrisk of having to raise capital at an inopportune time .  Private equity is a more flexible 6 \nand patient capital resource for a serial issuer on size and timing of repeated equity 7 \ninfusions and dividends.  Sensitivity to timing of quarterly earnings reports, news 8 \nreports, and dividend declarations becomes less important  to private equity .  Private 9 \nequity can enable a repea ting (“ serial ”) issuer  such as ALLETE  to more readily maintain 10 \na balanced capital structure.   The private equity environment can contribute toward 11 \nminimizing the cost of capital that customers ultimately pay for through rates.  From a 12 \nutility’s perspective, access to more flexible  private equity capital can provide a l ower 13 \nrisk of beneficial infrastructure investment for customers being delayed or minimized 14 \ndue to a constraint on public capital transactions.  15 \n 16 \nQ. Do you agree with Company  Witness Joshua D. Taran that company size 17 \ninfluences access to capital?  18 \nA. Yes.  Large IOUs enjoy  greater access to capital and a more diverse investor base than 19 \nsmall IOUs.   Some small companies cannot issue equity in large enough size for some 20 \nlarge public equity investors to participate in  invest ing due to internal investment 21 \nconsiderations . 22 \n 23 \nQ. Do you agree with Company Witness Taran that A LLETE  is a relatively small 24 \nutility holding  company ? 25 \nA. Yes.  MP Exhibit ____ ( Quackenbush ), Direct  Schedule 3, the EEI table, shows the 26 \nmarket capitalization of all U.S. electric IOUs.  As of December 31, 2023, there are 39 27 \nremaining U.S. electric IOUs , the number which has shrunk over time due to merger 28 \nand acquisition activity.  ALLETE is shown ranking 34th of 39 IOUs in size with a 29 \nmarket capitalization of $3.511  billion .  By comparison, the largest electric IOU is 30 \nNextEra Energy with a market capitalization of $123.381  billion , 35 times  larger than 31 \n \n 16 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  ALLETE.  The mean and median electric IOU market capitalization is $22.8  billion  and 1 \n$18 billion , respectively, still 6.5 times  and 5.1  times  larger than ALLETE.  There are 2 \n11 electric IOUs with market capitalization of greater than $30  billion .  By any standard, 3 \nALLETE would be categorized as a small electric IOU.  4 \n 5 \nQ. Do you agree with Company Witness Taran that ALLETE  has outsized capital 6 \ninvestment forecasts  for a relatively small utility  holding  company ? 7 \nA. Yes.  ALLETE  stands out as having an outsized regulated capital spending plan in an 8 \nindustry that is already among the most capital intensive.   Significant capital spending 9 \nacceleration of 3.8  times  over the next fi ve years compared to the last ten years  is 10 \ndemonstrated by Chart 1 in the Direct Testimony Company Witness  Taran .   11 \n 12 \nQ. How will acceleration of capital spending compare to ALLETE’s ability to 13 \ninternally fund that capital spending?  14 \nA. The impact  of the outsized capital spend plan will be significantly negative cash flow 15 \ngeneration , such that A LLETE ’s operating cash flows will fall significantly short of 16 \ncapital expenditure needs  to a greater degree than the electric utility industry in general .  17 \nALLETE  will need to tap the capital markets repeatedly.  The proxy statement describes 18 \nALLETE  as a “serial issuer,” meaning it will need sizable and frequent equity issuances.    19 \n 20 \nQ. What appears to be the driver of A LLETE ’s outsized capital spending plan for its 21 \nsize?  22 \nA. ALLETE’s  significant external financing  need s are largely driven by Minnesota Power , 23 \nwhich represents 87  percent  of ALLETE ’s capital plan .  Primary drivers of Minnesota 24 \nPower’s  significant capital acceleration appear to be the significant upfront capital needs 25 \ndue to  Minnesota state policies including  the 100  percent  by 2040 Carbon Free Standard 26 \nand Minnesota Power’s  approved 2021 Integrated Resource Plan (“ IRP”), which set s 27 \nforth a path to reducing carbon emissions 80  percent  by 2035 , including significant 28 \nadditions of wind and solar generation, energy storage resources, and electric 29 \ntransmission necessary to achieve those long -term goals.   Subsequent to filing its last 30 \nIRP, Minnesota enacted a new law requiring utility electric generation to be 80  percent  31 \n \n 17 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  carbon free by 2030, 90  percent  carbon free by 2035 , and 100  percent  carbon free by 1 \n2040.  Those new standards will drive additional capital needs that are expected to  be 2 \nevident in Minnesota Power’s next IRP planned for submission by March 1, 2025.  3 \n 4 \nQ. Do you agree that ALLETE would  likely  have challenges accessing the required  5 \nlevel of capital from public markets?  6 \nA. Yes, I do.  ALLETE’s outsized capital needs relative to its size and the serial nature of 7 \nits capital needs  would  present challenges to repeated large public market transactions.  8 \nAccessing patient private infrastructure investment will support ALLETE’s multi - 9 \ndecade effort s to achieve Minnesota’s policy goals . 10 \n 11 \nQ. Can you provide an example from your experience as a Senior I nvestment Analyst 12 \nat UBS that demonstrates that size influences access to capital?  13 \nA. Yes.  Some companies  are too small for large public market investors to participate  in 14 \nacquiring their stock .  During my time investing in utility equities at UBS , we had a size 15 \nconstraint  that prevented me from investing in ALLETE and other small er IOUs .  In 16 \ngeneral, I  could not invest in public companies with a market capitalization less than 17 \n$3 billion .  The reason had to do with the large size of our core U.S. domestic portfolio 18 \nand the high concentration level of our equity positions.  Overlaid on the portfolio 19 \nsituation was a concern that to build our desired position  to achieve a meaningful 20 \ncontribution to the portfolio return , we should not constitute more than 50  percent  of the  21 \ndaily  trading volume of the stock over a 20 -day time period .  The implication was that 22 \nif our investing activity dominated the stock trading volume, we would drive up the 23 \nstock price  before we could build an adequate  position, while selling our position in the 24 \nfuture would drive down the stock price before we could fully exit the position.  Our 25 \nUBS trading desk monitored  that calculation result ing in a general rule -of-thumb that 26 \n$3 billion  was our market capitalization floor , meaning I could not invest in ALLETE 27 \nstock at that time even if I found its valuation attractive.   Although I met with ALLETE 28 \nmanagement several times per year for industry context and potential future investment 29 \nif its size changed, I did not create the in -depth five -year financial models or thesis 30 \n \n 18 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  statements that would have been necessary for UBS portfolio managers to invest in 1 \nALLETE stock.   ALLETE was not a candidate for our portfolio due to its small size.  2 \n 3 \nQ. Can you provide examples from your experience as a capital markets issuer that 4 \ndemonstrate that size influences access to capital?  5 \nA. Yes. I participated in issuing debt securities  in the Treasury Department of  Sprint 6 \nCorporation for all of  its subsidiaries in the 1990s.   During that time period, Sprint 7 \nCorporation was the parent of 20 -25 LECs operating in 16 -20 states that were subject 8 \nto cost-of-service regulat ion by state public utility commissions  and the F ederal 9 \nCommunications Commissio n.  Additionally, Sprint Corporation was investing in 10 \nrapidly growing competitive businesses including the wireless and long -distance 11 \ndivisions.  Virtually all subsidiaries had 100  percent  of their stock owned by the parent 12 \nwhile having a significant need to repeatedly issue debt in the capital  markets .  Only the 13 \nlargest 3 -4 LECs  were large enough to issue their own debt.  The 17 -21 smaller LECs, 14 \nincluding United Telephone Company of Minnesota (later re -named Sprint – 15 \nMinnesota ), had large capital needs relative to their size but debt investors were 16 \nrelatively uninterested in small transaction sizes.  As a result, we created larger 17 \ntransaction sizes through stapled private placements whereby each smaller LEC’s debt 18 \nwas stapled in a package with the other small LECs  such that debt investors were eager 19 \nto buy the consolidated debt package, contributing to a lower cost of debt.  We were 20 \nfortunate to be able to create this unique framework to work around a potential lack of 21 \naccess to capital due to small size.  22 \n 23 \nSeparately, Sprint found it advantageous to issue debt to fund its rapidly growing 24 \ncompetitive businesses on a consolidated basis.  We created an entity named Sprint 25 \nCapital Corporation that was intended to issue debt on behalf of the competitive 26 \nbusinesses.  In November 1998, Sprint Capital was  able to issue $5  billion  of debt to 27 \neager debt investors in a single transaction which was, at the time, the second largest 28 \ncorporate debt issuance in history.  Again, we were fortunate to  create a framework that 29 \ncould avoid a potential size disadvantage that could have led to a lack of access to 30 \ncapital.  Both actual Sprint Treasury  examples for both regulated utilities and 31 \n \n 19 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  competitive firms demonstrate that larger size positively influences an issuer ’s access 1 \nto capital and the cost -effectiveness of that capital , and avoid the negative influence of 2 \nsmaller size . 3 \n 4 \nQ. Do you agree with Company Witness  Taran that customer base influences access 5 \nto capital ? 6 \nA. Yes.  ALLETE’s significant proportion of large industrial customers with variable load 7 \ncharacteristics poses a risk to investors and presents a challenge when it comes to access 8 \nto capital.  9 \n 10 \nQ. What is your understanding of the circumstances that led the ALLETE Board of 11 \nDirectors (the “Board”) to see advantages in private equity investmen ts? 12 \nA. My understanding comes from the Definitive P roxy Statement  (the “Proxy”)  filed with 13 \nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . The Proxy discloses that i n 2019, 14 \nALLETE developed its Sustainability -in-Action Strategy that was approved by the 15 \nBoard in October 2020.  This strategy included an approximately $20  billion  capital 16 \nplan over the next 20 years and $10 billion over the next 10 years to reduce carbon, 17 \nexpand renewables, enhance resiliency and reliability of the transmission grid, and also 18 \nto grow non -regulated businesses.  By October 2022, the Board began to serious ly 19 \nconsider a sale of the Company as a possible path to satisfy its significant capital needs 20 \nand address potential financing challenges.   21 \n 22 \nAfter continued discussion through March 2023, the Board decided to focus its outreach 23 \nto infrastructure and pension funds, because the Board believed that such parties would 24 \nhave the financial resources to invest in the substantial future capital growth needs while 25 \nalternative types of strategic buyers  such as other utilities  could have divergent priorities  26 \nwhich may not be fully aligned with ALLETE’s regulatory goals in Minnesota and 27 \nWisconsin.  Another utility would likely bring its own management team and priorities, 28 \nincluding the policies and goals of other jurisdictions in which it operates.  In contrast, 29 \nmost pension and infrastructure funds could provide increased access to capital to 30 \nenhance infrastructure investment as well as fast -track growth strategies, express a 31 \n \n 20 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules  commitment for a long -term hold , and make regulatory commitments, including those 1 \nrelating to employees and maintenance of existin g headquarters.    2 \n 3 \nBy February 2024, the Board reviewed an updated standalone financing plan that 4 \ncontemplated billions of dollars of capital expenditures over the next five years that 5 \nintroduced serial equity and debt issuance s.  By April 2024, the Board identified 6 \nstandalone financing plan risks including potentially challenging financial markets for 7 \ndebt offerings and the potential inability to pursue a change of control transaction for a 8 \nsignificant period of time in light of serial equity and debt offerings.  9 \n 10 \nThese observations from the Proxy suggest that private infrastructure investment  is a 11 \ngood fit  for ALLETE considering its unique circumstances.  12 \n 13 \nQ. When you served as Chair of the Michigan PSC, did you approve an acquisition of 14 \na Michigan electric utility by private infrastructure  investors?  15 \nA. Yes, I did.  My colleagues and I authorized the acquisition of Upper Peninsula Power 16 \nCompany ( “UPPCO ”) and its holding company by approving a settlement agreement in 17 \nCase  No. U -17564 on June 6, 2014  in advance of the 180 -day statutory deadline .  The 18 \napplication had been filed on March 17, 2014 by the seller, Integrys, and the buyer, 19 \nBalfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners.   In our order, we found that there would be no 20 \nadverse effect on customer rates or the provision of safe, reliable, and adequate service . 21 \nAdditionally, we found that subsidization  of a non -regulated activity through customer 22 \nrates would not result, and UPPCO’s ability to raise necessary capital and maintain a 23 \nreasonable capital structure would not be significantly impaired .  Finally, we found that  24 \nthe proposed transaction was consistent with the public interest.  25 \n 26 \nQ. What happened after the Michigan PSC  approval of the 2014 UPPCO transaction?  27 \nA. UPPCO maintained its financial health, continued providing safe, reliable, affordable, 28 \nand adequate service to its customers, and raised necessary capital while maintaining a 29 \nreasonable capital structure.  Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners was subsequently 30 \nre-named Basalt Infrastruc ture Partners.  31 \n \n 21 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules   1 \nQ. Did the Michigan PSC  subsequently approve another acquisition of UPPCO and 2 \nits holding company by different private infrastructure  investors?  3 \nA. Yes, it did, seven years later.  The M ichigan PSC authorized the acquisition of UPPCO 4 \nand its holding company by approving a settlement agreement in Case No. U -20995 on 5 \nMay 26, 2021, again in advance of the 180 -day statutory deadline.  The application had 6 \nbeen filed on February 26, 2021 by the seller, an affiliate of Basalt Infrastructure 7 \nPartners, and the buyer, Axium UP Holdings LLC, a Canadian private equity investor.  8 \nThe M ichigan PSC order found that there was no adverse effect on customer rates or 9 \nthe provision of safe, reliable, and adequate electric service .  Moreover, subsidization 10 \nof a non -regulated activity through customer rates would not result , and UPPCO’s 11 \nability to raise necessary capital and maintain a reasonable capital structure would not 12 \nbe significantly impaired .  Finally, the Michigan PSC found that  the proposed 13 \ntransaction was consistent with public policy and the public interest.   Axium continues 14 \nto own UPPCO equity through the present.  15 \n 16 \nQ. What do you see as the downside  if this Acquisition is not approved?  17 \nA. ALLETE  would not have access to the plentiful, patient capital that this proposed 18 \nAcquisition  would provide  and would most likely revert to  being a serial issuer of its 19 \nstandalone capital plan in the public equity market, with an outsized capital plan relative 20 \nto its size , subject to timing and market volatility constraints.  Proceeding on a 21 \nstandalone basis  without this proposed private equity transaction  would  heighten the 22 \nrisk of derailed or delayed  achievement of state policy goals  with negative implications 23 \nfor customers that count on safe, reliable, affordable, and clean electric utility service .  24 \nThe likelihood of  ALLETE  finding a subsequent private infrastructure investment 25 \ntransaction would be significantly diminished if this Acquisition  were not approved.  In 26 \nthat event, ALLETE  would lose the flexibility and timing benefits of private 27 \ninfrastructure investment , would have no assurance that a strategic investor would 28 \ncommit to Minnesota and Wisconsin state policy goals , and would, at minimum, lose 29 \nmultiple, valuable years of time in pursuing the path to invest in renewables, energy 30 \nstorage, and enabling transmission  that Minnesota customers desire . 31 \n \n 22 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nQuackenbush  Direct and Schedules   1 \nQ. Do you agree that the proposed Acquisition would improve ALLETE’s access to 2 \ncapital?  3 \nA. Yes, I do.  Accessing patient private infrastructure investment will support ALLETE’s 4 \nmulti -decade efforts to achieve Minnesota’s policy goals due to its outsized capital need 5 \nrelative to its si ze and the serial nature of its capital needs.  6 \n 7 \nIV. CONCLUSION  8 \nQ. Please summarize your Direct Testimony  for the Commission’s consideration.  9 \nA. Capital market access is important to regulated utilities and is even more important to 10 \nALLETE given its small size and outsized capital spending plan that is necessary to 11 \nenable Minnesota Power to achieve Minnesota state policy goals.  The proposed private 12 \nequity transaction is an ideal fit for ALLETE’s capital requirements .  Minnesota Power 13 \ncustomers will benefit  from a financially healthy  utility.  Private equity  is uniquely 14 \npositioned to support long -term infrastructure investment and enhance ALLETE’s 15 \naccess to capital and its ability to achieve carbon reduction  standards for 2030, 2035, 16 \nand 2040 .   17 \n 18 \nQ. Does this complete your Direct Testimony ? 19 \nA. Yes. 20 \n1  JOHN D.

INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ. Please state your name and business address.  2 \nA. My name is Ellen Lapson  and my business address is 370 Riverside Drive, New York, 3 \nNY 10025 . 4 \n 5 \nQ. By whom are you employed and in what position?  6 \nA. I am employed by Lapson Advisory , a division of Trade Resources Analytics, LLC . I 7 \nam a Member of the LLC and the Principal of Lapson Advisory , where  I provide 8 \nindependent advisory  services relating to the financial strength of utilities and 9 \ninfrastructure companies  and provide  expert testimony  regarding  utility capital market 10 \nmatters.   11 \n 12 \nQ. Please summarize your professional qualifications and experience.  13 \nA. I am a Chartered Financial Analyst (“CFA”) and earned a Master of Business 14 \nAdministration from New York University Stern School of Business with a 15 \nspecialization in Accounting  and Finance .  I have worked in the capital markets space 16 \nwith a particular focus on financing and analyzing the finances of regulated public 17 \nutilities for the past 50 years.  My professional qualifications appear in MP Exhibit ___ 18 \n(Lapson ), Direct Schedule  1. 19 \n 20 \nQ. Have you testified in any other proceeding?  21 \nA. Yes, I have testified as an expert financial witness in 64 proceedings before 17 state 22 \npublic utility commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The list of 23 \nthose proceedings and the topics of my testimony appear in MP Exhibit ___ (Lapson ), 24 \nDirect Schedule 1. 25 \n 26 \nQ. What is the purpose of your Direct Testimony ? 27 \nA. The purpose of my Direct Testimony  is first to explain  an analytical  framework for 28 \ndetermining the adequacy and appropriateness of a suite of protective measures 29 \ngenerally known as utility ring-fencing , and then to apply that analytical framework to 30 \nevaluate the ring-fencing  measures proposed by the parties in the context of the 31 \n \n 3 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  acquisition by funds managed  by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP 1 \nInvestments ”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) (together, the  “Partners”) o f 2 \nALLETE, Inc. including its utility division  Minnesota Power  (the “Acquisition”) .1  3 \nFinally, I will provide my conclusions about the potential impact of the ring -fencing and 4 \ngovernance commitments proposed in this transaction by the Partners and ALLETE  to 5 \nprotect the interests of Minnesota Power, its customers, and the communities it serves.  6 \n 7 \nQ. What is the basis of your expertise concerning protective measures and ring - 8 \nfencing in utility merger transactions?  9 \nA.  Before found ing Lapson Advisory in January 2012, I was a Senior Director and then a 10 \nManaging Director at Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), one of the three prominent credit rating 11 \nagencies in the U.S. market.  My team established and maintained the credit ratings of 12 \ninvestor -owned electric, gas, and water utilities.  In that function, for 17 years  I 13 \nperformed credit evaluations and supervised other analysts to rate over 100 electric, gas, 14 \nand water utilities , entailing the credit rating review of many merger transactions and 15 \nreorganization s in the utility sector .  Also, I supervised and wrote the credit rating 16 \nmethodologies that Fitch  applied in the investor -owned electric, gas, and water sector , 17 \nincluding criteria for utility ring -fencing regarding the effect of corporate structure and 18 \nprotective mechanisms on the financial viability of subsidiary companies and the 19 \nseparation of credit ratings within corporate groups.   Finally, I have closely studied the 20 \ncredit methodologies  of the two other large credit rating agencies , Moody’s Investors 21 \nService (“Moody’s”) and S &P Global Ratings (“S&P”), and in particular their criteria 22 \nregarding corporate separateness and ring -fencing protections.  23 \n 24 \nPrior to joining Fitch, I was employed from 1974 to 1994 in commercial and investment 25 \nbanking.  As a banker, I structured transactions for regulated utilities, utility holding 26 \ncompanies, and project -financed energy and natural resource projects, which frequently 27 \n \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Direct Testimony and the \nPetition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically \ndefined, references to “ALLETE” i ndicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota \nPower and all regulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n \n 4 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  includ ed structuring  bankruptcy -remote special purpose funding entities, partnership 1 \nstructures, and limited liability companies.  2 \n 3 \nSince founding Lapson Advisory, I have served as an expert witness in regulatory 4 \nproceedings involving the merger applications of electric, gas, and water utilities on the 5 \neffects of corporate structure and protective measures upon the utilities’ future viability 6 \nand financial strength.   7 \n 8 \nQ.  Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding?  9 \nA. Yes. I am sponsoring the following schedules to my Direct Testimony:  10 \n• MP Exhibit ___ (Lapson ), Direct Schedule 1 : Statement of Qualifications and 11 \nSummary of Proceedings;  12 \n• MP Exhibit ___ (Lapson ), Direct Schedule 2 : Ring -Fencing Standards ; and  13 \n• MP Exhibit ___ (Lapson ), Direct Schedule 3 : Evaluating the Company’s 14 \nProposed Protective Commitments . 15 \n 16 \nQ. How is your Direct Testimony organized?  17 \nA. Section II presents an Executive Summary of my Direct Testimony .  18 \n 19 \nSection III summarizes the Acquisition  from the viewpoint of corporate structure and 20 \nseparateness .  21 \n 22 \nIn Section I V, I explain the analytical framework that I employ for the evaluation of 23 \ncorporate separateness and protective measures.  24 \n 25 \nSection V  applies  that framework to evaluate the corporate separateness and protective  26 \nmeasures proposed by the Partners and ALLETE  in this Acquisition.  27 \n 28 \nIn Section VI , I discuss the reactions of credit rating agencies that rate ALLETE’s  29 \nbonds and debt to the announcement of the planned Acquisition.  30 \n 31 \n \n 5 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  Finally, Section V II presents my conclusions.  1 \n 2 \nII. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  3 \nQ. Please summarize your Direct Testimony.   4 \nA. I have reviewed the Acquisition that is the subject of the Petition of Minnesota Power 5 \nfor the Acquisition of ALLETE by CPP Investments  and GIP, MPUC Docket 6 \nNo. E015/PA -24-198 (the “Petition ”). The purpose of my review was  to evaluate 7 \nwhether the future  integrity and  financial viability of ALLETE , including Minnesota 8 \nPower,  may be vulnerable to any harm from the purchasers CPP Investments  and GIP 9 \nor any of their related entities and affiliates.   10 \n 11 \nAn important part of this review involves applying a set of systematic and 12 \ncomprehensive standards reflecting  prior experience regarding the protection of a 13 \ncompany from adversity as a result of its affiliation with a parent or affiliated entities. 14 \nThis master list incorporates  the guidelines used by law firms and further developed  by 15 \nthe three major credit rating agencies  over the course of five decades  as well as my own 16 \nobservations of utilities  and energy companies  in financial distress or bankruptcy.   In 17 \nSection IV , I explain the source of the analytical standards applied in this testimony and 18 \nwhy they are effective in insulating a company from adverse consequences relating to 19 \nthe actions or liabilities of its direct or indirect owners or their affiliates.  20 \n 21 \nAfter conducting my  review based upon  this set of  standards, I find that the corporate 22 \nstructure and ring-fencing provisions proposed in the Acquisition  conform to  these 23 \nstandards  and will provide ALLET E and Minnesota Power with adequate protection in 24 \nall circumstances .   25 \n 26 \nThe proposed ring -fencing and protective provisions will enable ALLETE to retain 27 \naccess to all of its own financial and physical assets and cash flow so that ALLETE and 28 \nMinnesota Power  can properly conduct business and remain viable, even in the case of 29 \nfinancial distress of any Alloy Entities  (defined below), the Partners , or any of the 30 \nPartners’ affiliates.  In addition, the protective provisions will provide appropriate 31 \n \n 6 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  separation for ALLETE and Minnesota Power and its utility customers and communities 1 \nfrom the risk of involuntary consolidation in bankruptcy with Alloy Parent LLC, Alloy 2 \nIntermediateCo LLC, Alloy Topco LLC, Alloy Holdings LP  (together referred to in my 3 \ntestimony as the “Alloy Entities”), the Partners , CPP Investments and GIP,  or any 4 \naffiliates or investment partners of the Partners.   5 \n 6 \nFurthermore , the protective features of the corporate structure and ring -fencing 7 \ncommitments will satisfy  the standards applied by  S&P and Moody’s  in their credit 8 \nrating reviews  of ALLETE .  Finally,  the Minnesota Public Utilities Commissio n’s 9 \n(“Commission ”) regulatory oversight of  Minnesota Power  will be preserved.  Therefore, 10 \nI recommend that the Commission approve the proposed protective mechanisms  and 11 \nring-fencing commitments .  12 \n 13 \nIII. THE ACQUISITION  14 \nQ. What are the key features of the Acquisition that protect Minnesota Power’s 15 \nfinancial viability even without any of the additional commitments ALLETE and 16 \nthe Partners have made?   17 \nA. Before considering any additional protective commitments , which will be the topic of 18 \nSections IV and V , I can point out  five noteworthy  features of the proposed Acquisition  19 \nthat will tend to protect Minnesota Power’s  continuing viability .  20 \n 21 \nFirst, the Acquisition’s  legal  structure is designed to insulate ALLETE from the Partners  22 \nand their affiliates through separate corporate  entities . The Partners will own the shares 23 \nof ALLETE through  a limited partnership (Alloy Holdings, LP), which will in turn own  24 \n100 percent of a limited liability company , Alloy Topco L LC (“Topco”).  Topco  in turn 25 \nwill own 100  percent of Alloy IntermediateCo LLC  (“IntermediateCo”) , which in turn 26 \nwill own 100  percent of the limited liability company  Alloy Parent LLC  (“Alloy 27 \nParent”) , the direct parent of ALLETE .2  The Alloy Entities will separate ALLETE from 28 \nthe Partners ’ other investments, including the investments of  GIP and CPP I nvestments  29 \n \n2 Petition at Attachment A -2. \n \n 7 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  and GIP’s separately managed account, Tower Bridge  Infrastructure Partners, L.P .  The 1 \nAlloy Entities were formed specifically for the purpose  of the Acquisition and will not 2 \nconduct any business aside from that purpose.    3 \n 4 \nSecond, a very high proportion of the funding for the purchase of ALLETE shares will 5 \nbe provided as common equity contributions from the Partners , while only a minor 6 \nproportion  of the funds will be debt -financed.  The committed debt arranged by the 7 \nPartners provides for debt facilities  of up to $700 million of loans to Alloy Parent, the 8 \ndirect parent of ALLETE , of which $300 million is expected to be used to fund part of 9 \nthe purchase price , and the balance of $400 million will be available as a reserve to fund 10 \nadditional capital needs .3  No acquisition borrowing is planned at ALLETE ,4 and the 11 \namounts  of equity and debt making up ALLETE’s capital structure will remain 12 \nunchanged.5  Thus, the Acquisition  does not increase debt leverage at ALLETE, nor will 13 \nthere be excessive debt leverage above ALLETE at the Alloy Entities. Company 14 \nWitness Joshua D. Taran further addresses the Company’s utilization of debt and equity.  15 \n 16 \nThird, Minnesota Power  will remain subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission . The 17 \nutility must continue to comply with all Commission regulations, such as the 18 \nrequirement to receive authorization for borrowing s or the sale or purchase of material 19 \nassets, as well as  the Commission’s affiliate transaction rules.  This is an important 20 \nprotective feature for investors that is also  respected by credit rating agencies.  21 \n 22 \nFourth, the Merger Agreement, Petition, and the Company Disclosure Letter (Section 23 \n6.06(b)(iv) ) contain commitments that are consistent with a rigorous set of separateness 24 \nstandards .  The commitments , which were confirmed by Partner Witnesses  Jonathan 25 \nBram and Andrew Alley,6 will prevent the diversion of assets from ALLETE and 26 \n \n3 Preliminary Proxy Statement of ALLETE  (“Preliminary Proxy Statement ”), June 20 , 2024, at 19-21.    \n4 A Backstop financing commitment at ALLETE alluded to in ALLETE’s Preliminary Proxy Statement at page \n19 was terminated after ALLETE received consents from its existing lenders in September 2024.  \n5 Petition  at 10. There will be no change in ALLETE’s  outstanding debt , while  current publicly  traded common \nequity will be replaced by new private equity.  \n6 Direct Testimony of Josh ua D.  Taran, Section III .B; Direct Testimony of Jonathan Bram, Section VII; Direct \nTestimony of Andrew Alley, Section IV. \n \n 8 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  prevent ALLETE from becoming subject to liabilities of its direct and indirect parents 1 \nand their affiliates .  The specific commitments are the subject of Section V of this Direct 2 \nTestimony.  3 \n 4 \nFinally, the identity of the Partners and their motivation for owning ALLETE greatly 5 \nfavor the  protection of  ALLETE’s separateness  and lessen  the likelihood of diversion 6 \nof assets or financial contagion.  The Partners  are major financial institutions and highly 7 \nrespected investment managers .  Unlike a utility holding company that owns one or 8 \nmore utilities in order to consolidate management and ownership of several companies  9 \nfor synergistic  profits , these investment managers will not seek to merge ALLETE into 10 \na group of utilities.  Rather, the Partners  are fiduciaries represent ing pensioners , pension 11 \nfunds,  and institutional investors that seek stable long -term returns. It is also  very 12 \nimportant that these Partners will be  a steady source of funding for ALLETE’s future 13 \nequity needs.   14 \n 15 \nIV. FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING CORPORATE SEPARATENESS  16 \nQ. What do you mean by corporate separateness?  17 \nA. I use this terminology to describe a suite of methods used to insulate and protect one 18 \nenterprise or business activity from  invasion, contagion, or harm due to mingling with 19 \nother related entities.  A more colloquial  term is “ring -fencing .”  20 \n 21 \nQ.  When and why are ring -fencing protections necessary?   22 \nA. Protective ring -fencing methods typically serve one of two purposes.  First, in the 23 \ncontext of corporate finance and corporate structure, ring -fencing mechanisms are used 24 \nto protect a company and its stakeholders from financial risks associated with the 25 \ncompany’s parent, affiliated companies, or subsidiaries.7  Another context for ring - 26 \nfencing is when a financial sponsor (the seller) bundles together a portfolio of loans or 27 \nmortgages and sells them to a shell entity (the purchaser) that finances the purchase by 28 \n \n7 In this testimony, the term “corporate” in the context of “corporate structure,” “intercorporate separation,” or \n“corporate group” refers not only to entities structured as corporations but also to partnerships, limited \npartnerships, limited liability com panies (“LLCs”), and related forms of enterprise ownership.   \n \n 9 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  issuing loans or securities backed solely by the value and cash flows of the portfolio 1 \nassets.  In the context of banking, leasing, and real estate ownership, such mechanisms 2 \nseparate the purchaser and its assets from exposure to the bankruptcy risk of the sponsor 3 \nor seller of the assets.  This allows the funding of the assets based solely upon the quality 4 \nof the asset portfolio, unaffected by the credit of the sponsor or seller.  5 \n 6 \nIn either of these contexts, the purpose of implementing a set of ring -fencing 7 \nmechanisms is to safeguard a “Protected Company ” (a business or an asset portfolio) so 8 \nthat the Protected Company can sustain its viability without interruption or adverse 9 \neffects from invasion of its assets by its parent or affiliates or contagion from the 10 \npotential financial distress of another entity in its affiliated group .   11 \n 12 \nQ. What is the purpose of ring -fencing in the utility sector?  13 \nA. A utility typically bears a legal obligation to operate reliably and maintain its systems 14 \nfor existing customers and expand its facilities and systems to accommodate growth of 15 \ndemand and new  customer s.  Utility  capital expenditures are  generally  not discretionary 16 \nbut are required to enable  the utility to fulfill its franchise obligations and satisfy the 17 \nrequirements of the regulatory authority.  Making such capital investments typically 18 \nrequires access to funding from internal and  external sources.  Thus, it is important for 19 \nthe utility to retain access to its own resources including its bank accounts, accounts 20 \nreceivable, and the ability to draw under its credit arrangements, even if its parent or an 21 \naffiliate is in financial distress.  If internal sources of cash flow are not sufficient, 22 \nutilities need to access funding from the debt market.  Without adequate protection, the 23 \nutility’s credit worthiness and access to debt capital could be impaired if its owner is in 24 \nfinancial distress, in default, or bankrupt.  Ring -fencing mechanisms have been 25 \nsuccessfully used to protect utilities from risky parents or affiliated companies and have 26 \nproven effective in allowing the Protected Companies  to carry out their mandate to serve 27 \npresent and future customers.  28 \n 29 \n \n 10 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  Q. Do you have  an established  framework or set of standards for evaluating the 1 \neffectiveness of intercorporate separation provisions?  2 \nA. Yes.  Over the years, attorneys and credit rating agencies have amassed a great deal of 3 \nexperience based upon actual case studies of insolvencies. Law firms that work on 4 \nsecurities issu ances and render non -consolidation opinions have in -house standards that 5 \nthey apply to determine the adequacy of protective ring -fencing, but law firms generally 6 \ndo not publish their standards.8  Likewise, credit rating agencies have developed their 7 \nown standards, drawn from the standards of their legal advisors as well as their own 8 \nexperiences of corporate defaults , to develop lists of corporate policies and practices 9 \nthat they apply to determine if two companies with corporate affiliation should be rated 10 \nwith the same  rating, or if the ratings of the two entities can be separated due to the 11 \npresence of protective mechanisms.9   12 \n 13 \nWhile law firms’ standards are more narrowly focused on the avoidance of involuntary 14 \nconsolidation of one company in the bankruptcy of another company, the rating 15 \nagencies display a much broader interest in preserving the integrity and financial well - 16 \nbeing of a company from erosion by the involvement of another affiliated company even 17 \nin situations that are less dire than bankruptcy.  I have incorporated  lists of standards 18 \npublished by rating agencies to develop a framework for the systematic evaluation of 19 \nprovisions that protect an individual company within a corporate group of companies.  20 \n \n8 It is possible to infer the in -house standards of a law firm by reading several reasoned non-consolidation opinions \nwritten by law partners of the firm , but this is not as convenient as referring to the publications of credit rating \nagency methodologies .  Legal journals publish highly detailed articles about specific elements of corporate \nstructure or business conduct that bore upon the results of decisions in bankruptcy court, but these are excessively \ndetailed and only of interest to practitioners of bank ruptcy law.  \n9 Since credit rating agencies must make public their rating methodologies and criteria, they publish their ring -\nfencing policies and standards.  The standards published by leading rating agencies are useful as general guidelines, \neven for companies that are  unrated or have ratings from a different credit rating agency.  I have found the \nfollowing sources to be especially useful : Fitch Ratings, “Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage Criteria, ” June \n16, 2023 , https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate -finance/parent -subsidiary -linkage -rating -criteria -16-\n06-2023 ; S&P Global Ratings, “General Criteria: Group Rating Methodology ,” July 1, 2019, republished Oct ober \n31, 2023 , https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/ -/view/sourceId/10999747 ; S&P Global \nRatings, “Criteria | Structured Finance | Legal: U.S. Structured Finance Asset Isolation and Special -Purpose Entity \nCriteria ,” May 15, 2019, republished April 1, 2022 , https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/pt/regulatory/article/ -\n/view/sourceId/10950501 ; Moody’s Investors Service, “Rating Methodology, Regulated Electric and Gas \nUtilities, ” June 23, 2017 , Appendix B at 35 -37, https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc -documents/68547 . \n \n \n 11 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  By combin ing and harmoniz ing the elements that major rating agencies employ in their 1 \nseparate guidelines , I distilled  a master list of standards for evaluating the adequacy of 2 \nintercorporate separation.  The result is the set of protective ring -fencing practices and 3 \npolicies provided as MP Exhibit ___ ( Lapson), Direct Schedule 2.   4 \n 5 \nQ.  Please explain the standards that make up this framework.  6 \nA.  The master checklist is based on the concept that two types of protection are likely to 7 \nsafeguard the viability of a Protected Company  from adverse financial consequences 8 \nstemming from its parents and affiliates :  9 \nI.  Practices that allow the Protected Company to maintain access 10 \nto its own physical and financial assets and sources of funding, 11 \nshielded from invasion by a parent or affiliate and even despite 12 \nthe financial distress of its parent or affiliate; and  13 \nII.  Practices that eliminate or reduce the risk that the Protected 14 \nCompany will be drawn into the bankruptcy of its parent or 15 \naffiliate.   16 \nTherefore , the framework  has two tracks: Track I contains practices that allow 17 \nan entity (the Protected Company ) to preserve its own identity, remain viable, fund 18 \nitself , resist incurring liabilities unrelated to its own business,  and to defend its own 19 \nassets and liabilities even if its parent or an affiliate  of the parent  is in distress ; and Track 20 \nII contains practices that protect a company from involuntary consolidation by a 21 \nbankruptcy court with its parent or affiliate in the parent or affiliate’s  bankruptcy 22 \nproceeding.  Some practices that appear in  Track I are also components  in Track II, 23 \nsince some practices do double duty, serving to achieve the objectives of both tracks.  24 \n 25 \nQ. What entity or entities is the Protected Company in this Acquisition ?  26 \nA. As the  primary  entity that issues equity and debt and obtains capital for both regulated 27 \nand non -regulated functions, ALLETE is the Protected Company .  Minnesota Power is 28 \nan operating  division of ALLETE and not a distinct corporate entity. As a division, 29 \nMinnesota Power benefits from ring -fencing provisions that are applied to ALLETE.  30 \nThis is the status quo ante  – that is, the situation prior to the proposed Acquisition, which 31 \n \n 12 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  the Commission has previously found to be appropriate and sufficient to protect 1 \nMinnesota Power customers.  I have observed that  the terms of the Merger Agreement 2 \npreserve the same level of protections  (although they may not be in exactly the same 3 \nform)  that are present in the pre -existing structure.   4 \n 5 \nQ. Please explain the elements that make up Track I.  6 \nA. Track I includes mechanisms that allow a company within an ownership group to 7 \npreserve its independent viability in the event of the financial distress of its parent or 8 \nother companies in its group.  Within Track I, there are four types of measures  utilized 9 \nby the rating agencies .  These are:  10 \nI-A. The Protected Company’s assets are protected from diversion by 11 \nhaving a separate legal identity, separate bank accounts and asset 12 \naccounts, with no commingling of assets.  Fixed assets needed to 13 \ncarry out the business should be in the Protected Company’s own 14 \nname.  Transfers of goods, services, and supplies with other 15 \nmembers of the group should be conducted on an arm’s length 16 \nbasis.   17 \nI-B.  The Protected Company can maintain its own access to funding 18 \nand to sources of liquidity.  The Protected Company should have 19 \naccess to a liquidity credit arrangement that is available for 20 \ndrawing even despite the default of the company’s parent or 21 \naffiliated companies.  The default by a parent or affiliate should 22 \nnot trigger a cross default or cross acceleration of the Protected 23 \nCompany ’s debt.  If the Protected Company is an accepted issuer 24 \nof debt in its own name in the public or private debt market, that 25 \nwill enhance access to funding, and maintaining a credit rating 26 \nalso helps to foster that aim.  27 \nI-C.    The Protected Company is insulated from the liabilities of its 28 \nparent and affiliates of the parent (sister companies) .  It does not 29 \nguarantee the debt or obligations of other members of its group, 30 \nand the other members of the group never represent to the public 31 \n \n 13 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  or to counterparties that the Protected Company is responsible for 1 \nthe obligations of other group members.  2 \nI-D.  The Protected Company can further protect its viability by 3 \nlimiting its financial leverage and preserving its individual 4 \nsolvency.  This is not a requirement for ring -fencing, but it is a 5 \nprotective element.  6 \n 7 \nQ. Please explain the elements of Track II.  8 \nA.  Track II involves steps to avoid the involuntary consolidation of the Protected Company 9 \nin the bankruptcy of its parent or an affiliate.  As I have mentioned already, several of 10 \nthe practices that are important in Track I to maintain the company’s separate financial 11 \nviability also do double duty by helping to avoid involuntary consolidation due to the 12 \ndoctrine of substantive consolidation.   13 \n 14 \nQ. What do you mean by substantive consolidation?  15 \n A.  A solvent company within a corporate group might be vulnerable to substantive 16 \nconsolidation along with its bankrupt parent or affiliate if the resources, assets, and 17 \nliabilities of the companies are so commingled and poorly documented that it is difficult 18 \nfor the bankruptcy court to untangle them.  Another possible cause for substantive 19 \nconsolidation is if any of the companies in the past represented to creditors that the 20 \nassets or cash flow of one company (now solvent) was available to satisfy the debts of 21 \nthe other company (now insolvent).  When the court finds either of those patterns, then 22 \ncreditors of the bankrupt company would seek as a remedy the consolidation of the 23 \nsolvent company in the bankruptcy proceeding to enhance recovery by the bankrupt 24 \nentity’s creditors.   25 \n 26 \nQ. What protections does a company have against substantive consolidation with a 27 \nparent or another affiliate of the parent?  28 \nA.   Forms of protection against substantive consolidation include : having separate 29 \ncorporate entities; keeping good books and records ; maintaining separate books of 30 \naccount ; and not commingling funds or assets .  The Protected Company should not own 31 \n \n 14 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  shares of the parent or parent ’s affiliates, nor guarantee the parent’s or parent ’s 1 \naffiliates’ debt. Also, neither the Protected Company nor its parent  or affiliates should 2 \nrepresent to creditors of the parent or affiliates that the Protected Company is 3 \nresponsible for the obligations  of its parent or its parent’s affiliates .   4 \n 5 \nV. EVALUATING ALLETE’S PROTECTION IN THE PROPOSED 6 \nACQUISITION   7 \nQ. How d id you apply  the ring -fencing and separateness framework to analyze this 8 \nAcquisition ? 9 \nA. Using  the framework presented in my MP Exhibit ___ ( Lapson), Direct Schedule 2 , I 10 \nanalyzed the ring -fencing commitments made by Minnesota Power and the Partners that 11 \nI referenced earlier . In addition, I considered certain important protections that exist 12 \nbecause of existing Commission regulations with which Minnesota Power and ALLETE 13 \nmust comply  in the normal course of business .  Examples include the requirement s that 14 \nthe Commission must approve ALLETE’s debt incurrence  and transfers of property,  as 15 \nwell as  the Commission’s regulations concerning arm’s length transactions with 16 \naffiliated parties.    17 \n 18 \nQ.  Please summarize the most important aspects of the proposed protective 19 \ncommitments.  20 \nA.  Among the s trong protective commitments that will separate  ALLETE  from liabilities 21 \nand risks of the Alloy Entities and from GIP and C PP Investments  are:    22 \n1. Separate books and record keeping , and separate financial accounts ;  23 \n2. No commingl ing of cash with Alloy P arent and no intercompany lending by 24 \nALLETE (except with the  Commission ’s approval );   25 \n3. Debt and credit facilities of ALLETE  shall not contain  any cross defaults, cross 26 \nacceleration, credit guarantees, or credit rating triggers linking ALLETE with 27 \nAlloy Parent  or any Alloy Entities,  or with any of the Partners or their co- 28 \ninvestors or  subsidiaries;  29 \n \n 15 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  4. ALLETE will maintain access to its own assets and properties, accounts 1 \nreceivable and other accounts, not affected by the bankruptcy or distress of any 2 \nAlloy Entities  or the Partners or the Partners’ affiliates ;  3 \n5. ALLETE will maintain liquidity facilities and sources  in its own name , 4 \npermitting borrowing  without regard to the credit ratings or default or 5 \nbankruptcy of Alloy Parent or any Alloy Entities , the Partners, or the Partners’ 6 \naffiliates ;  7 \n6. ALLETE’S capital structure will be maintained consistent with the 8 \nCommission’s authorized capital structure , further assuring that there will not 9 \nbe excessive leverage introduced due to the Transaction ; 10 \n7. No u pstream dividends or distributions can be paid by ALLETE unless  11 \nALLETE’s  corporate  credit rating by at least one of two rating agencies  is at 12 \nleast an investment grade rating , except with prior approval by the Commission ; 13 \nand 14 \n8. ALLETE  and the Alloy Entities will be structured and will conduct business 15 \nsuch that in the event of a  bankruptcy of Alloy Parent or any Alloy Entities  or 16 \naffiliates (other than ALLETE and its subsidiaries), (a) a bankruptcy court will 17 \nnot consolidate the assets and liabilities of ALLETE with those of Alloy Parent 18 \nor any Parent entity ; and (b) except as may be required by law, any costs or 19 \nobligations of a bankruptcy  of Alloy Parent or any Alloy E ntity cannot be sought 20 \nfrom ALLETE .   21 \n 22 \nQ. What plans have ALLETE and the Partners announced for financing a portion of 23 \nthe Acquisition  with debt?  24 \nA.  The Partners have obtained commitments from two banks for up to $700 million in loans 25 \nfor the Acquisition , including up to $400 million for potential go -forward support for 26 \nALLETE .  These loans would be direct borrowings of Alloy Parent and would carry a 27 \nlimited guarantee of IntermediateCo, secured by a pledge of IntermediateCo’s holdings 28 \nof shares of ALLETE.  ALLETE would not be an obligor or guarantor of such debt, and 29 \nno assets of ALLETE or Minnesota Power would be encumbered by liens securing the 30 \ndebt.  At an earlier stage in the Acquisition , the parties arranged for Backstop Facilities 31 \n \n 16 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  that would permit refunding certain debts of ALLETE in the event that their lenders 1 \ndemanded repayment upon a change in control. However , ALLETE has reached 2 \nagreements with all of its lenders consenting  to the change of control, so the 3 \ncommitments that were received to provide Backstop Facilities (as described in 4 \nALLETE’s Proxy Statement) have been terminated. Consequently, no acquisition 5 \nborrowing is planned at ALLETE.  6 \n 7 \nQ. Will the financing arrangements result in the addition of excessive debt leverage 8 \naffecting the creditworthiness of ALLETE ? 9 \nA. Of the $700 million of debt that is planned at Alloy Parent , $300 million will be used to 10 \nfund the purchase of ALLETE shares  and $400 million will be used for additional 11 \ncapital needs post -closing , with the balance of the Acquisition  to be funded with 12 \ncommon equity.  In my opinion, this is a very modest amount of debt financing. 13 \nALLETE will not be a guarantor or a borrower, and it is unlikely to have any adverse 14 \nimpact on Minnesota Power’s financial strength or resilience.  15 \n 16 \nQ.  What was the result of your review of the protective provisions that are proposed 17 \nfor this Acquisition ?  18 \nA.  Using the framework as a checklist, I found that the proposed ring -fencing provisions 19 \nconform with  the requirements of the framework and will provide an adequate  20 \nseparation of ALLETE from risks associated with affiliation with the Partners and any 21 \nother companies under their ownership or control.  The analysis is presented in MP 22 \nExhibit ___ ( Lapson), Direct Schedule 3. 23 \n 24 \nQ.  Does the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Management, LLC by BlackRock 25 \nInc. (“BlackRock”) change the methods or results of your analysis ? 26 \nA. No. The very same protective provisions that insulate ALLETE and M innesota Power  27 \nfrom exposure  to GIP would be equally effective if GIP’s role were replaced by 28 \nBlackRock.  With strong ring -fencing in effect, there is no difference at all in that 29 \ncircumstance .  30 \n 31 \n \n 17 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  Q. Are there additional commitments proposed in the Company’s Petition for 1 \nApproval aside from the protective ring-fencing provisions  that you have discussed 2 \nabove?  3 \nA.  Yes, the Petition includes some proposed commitments that do not relate to the future 4 \nsolvency or financial protection of ALLETE or bankruptcy remoteness from the 5 \nAlloyed Entities or Alloy Parent. Instead, several  of ALLETE’s proposed commitments 6 \nare designed to preserve the Commission’s regulatory jurisdiction, for example, by 7 \nassuring that the Commission will continue to receive all the information and accounting 8 \nreports  it needs  to carry out its regulatory functions.  Some  commitments aim to protect 9 \nthe interests of the state and the community, such as a commitment to keep the 10 \nCompany’s headquarters in Duluth, Minnesota ; to maintain its current collective 11 \nbargaining agreements and union contracts ; and to maintain employment of non - 12 \nbargaining employees for two years post -closing.  These are not part of the ring -fencing 13 \nframework , but will be meaningful to many interested parties, to the Commission, and 14 \nto the communities served by Minnesota Power .   15 \n 16 \nVI. CREDIT RATING REACTIONS  17 \nQ. How did the two credit rating agencies that rate ALLETE’s debt obligations 18 \nrespond to the announcement of the Merger Agreement in 2024?  19 \nA. Moody’s affirmed ALLETE’s Baa1 long -term credit rating and its Stable rating outlook, 20 \nwith the following explanation:  21 \nWe viewed the announcement as initially credit neutral because we do 22 \nnot expect a significant deviation from current credit profile as a result 23 \nof a material change in regulated business, capital structure or dividend 24 \npolicy. To the extent that the acquisition does result in material 25 \nadditional debt that would need to be serviced by ALLETE, a higher 26 \nbusiness risk profile or a more aggressive financial policy, ALLETE ’s 27 \nrating could be adversely affected. 10 28 \n 29 \nS&P took a more cautious approach; while it affirmed ALLETE’s long -term issuer 30 \ncredit rating of BBB, it changed the rating outlook to Negative from Stable. The change 31 \n \n10 Petition  at Attachment J -1 at 1. \n \n 18 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  in outlook was not based upon structural concerns, but rather upon S&P’s concern that 1 \nthe Acquisition might be funded with the incurrence of additional debt by ALLETE, 2 \nwith an adverse effect upon the Company’s key cash flow credit ratio.  The S&P analyst 3 \nwrote:  4 \nThe negative outlook reflects the possibility for higher leverage and 5 \nweaker financial measures because of the acquisition. We could lower 6 \nour ratings on ALLETE if its leverage increases and its financial 7 \nmeasures weaken such that its funds from operations (FFO) to debt falls 8 \nbelow 17%.  . . . However, if the company ’s post -acquisition capital 9 \nstructure incorporates a higher level of debt leverage, its consolidated 10 \nfinancial measures could consistently weaken below our downside 11 \ntrigger [of FFO to debt of 17%]. We will continue to monitor the 12 \nregulatory approval process and assess the company ’s planned funding 13 \nstrategy as it develops.11 14 \n 15 \nQ. How do you interpret S&P’s reaction to the Company’s announcement of the 16 \nMerger Agreement?  17 \nA.  It is quite common for credit rating agencies to react quickly to the initial announcement 18 \nof a transaction with a negative outlook and statements of concern about the potential 19 \nfor added debt leverage.  A close reading of S&P’s text does not reveal that S&P had 20 \nany doubts about  the nature of the post -Acquisition  corporate structure or the ultimate 21 \nprotective provisions ; it is abundantly clear that S&P ’s sole concern is ALLETE’s future 22 \ndebt leverage as measured by the agency’s key cash flow leverage ratio of FFO to Debt.  23 \nIf the Acquisition  does not result in excessive incremental leverage and assuming there 24 \nare no negative developments prior to the closing of the Acquisition , S&P could resolve 25 \nits rating for ALLETE by reverting to a Stable  rating outlook.   26 \n 27 \nQ.  In your view, is the concern that S&P’s analyst expressed regarding excessive 28 \nleverage resulting from the Acquisition  still warranted?  29 \nA.  No.  The details of the financing arrangements are now known, with no additional  debt 30 \nat ALLETE  and a relatively small amount at Alloy Parent.  It appears in retrospect that 31 \nS&P’s early fears in April 2024 about excessive acquisition debt have not been borne 32 \n \n11 Petition at Attachment J -2 at 1. \n \n \n 19 OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Direct and Schedules  out.  Moody’s reviewed the proposed Acquisition  several months later in July 2024, 1 \nperhaps with a preliminary idea of the financing plan, and Moody’s states its view that 2 \nthe plan is credit neutral.     3 \n 4 \nVII. CONCLUSION  5 \nQ. Please summarize your Direct Testimony  for the Commission’s consideration.  6 \nA. Using a systematic framework to assess the ring -fencing and protective  commitments 7 \nproposed by the  Partners and ALLETE , I find that the proposed commitments match 8 \nup well with the standards for a robust intercorporate separation, as summarized in MP 9 \nExhibit  ___ (Lapson), Direct Schedule 3.  I conclude that the proposed structure and 10 \ncommitments  will constitute an effective  separation of ALLETE from exposure to the 11 \nrisks of its parent Alloy Parent and from the Partners (GIP and CPP Investment s) and 12 \nfrom any liabilities or activities of GIP’s and CPP Investments’  other investments and 13 \naffiliates.  ALLETE will be able to maintain access to sources of funding and to maintain 14 \ncontrol of its own assets and liquidity despite any potential financial distress of its new 15 \ncorporate parents or their affiliates.   16 \n 17 \nFurthermore, the normal supervision of the Commission enhance s the effectiveness of 18 \nthe protective commitments . The Commission’s  regulatory authority and controls (in 19 \nsuch areas as a utility’s transactions with affiliates, transfers of utility assets, and 20 \nissuance of debt ) provide assurance to creditors and credit rating agencies of the strength 21 \nof the ring -fencing commitments.  22 \n   23 \nTherefore, I recommend that the Commission accept the commitments proposed by 24 \nALLETE  and the Partners .  25 \n 26 \nQ. Does this complete your Direct Testimony ? 27 \nA. Yes.  28 \n/0 /1 /2 /0 /3 /4 /0 /5 /6 /0 /i255 /8 /5 /9 /i255 /10 /11 /8 /12 /4 /13 /4 /6 /8 /14 /4 /15 /5 /16\n/0 /12 /12 /0 /5 /i255 /12 /8 /2 /16 /15 /5 /17 /i255 /6 /13 /8\n/18 /19 /20 /i255 /22

    "content": "Petition for Intervention International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49 and \nNorth Central States Regional Council of Carpenters  \n \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of Allete by Canada Pension \nPlan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners (24 -198) \n \nThe International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49 (“Local 49”) and the North Central \nStates Regional Council of Carpenters (“NCSRCC”) hereby jointly petition for intervention as a \nparty (“Labor Intervenors”) in Minnesota Public Utility Commission (“C ommission”)  \nconsideration of the applications by Minnesota Power for a route permit and certificate of need \nfor the HVDC modernization project (“Project”).  \nLocal 49 is a labor organization that represents more than 12,000 construction workers and \npublic employees in Minnesota.  Local 49 also represents construction workers and public \nemployees in North Dakota and South Dakota.  Local 49’s principal place of b usiness is located \nat 2829 Anthony Lane South in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  \nNCSRCC is a labor organization that represents more than 12,000 construction workers in \nMinnesota.  NCSRCC also represents construction workers in North Dakota, South Dakota, \nIowa, Wisconsin and Nebraska.  NCSRCC’s principal place of business is 700 Olive St. Saint \nPaul, MN 55130.  \nIn addition to traditional union representation roles (collective bargaining for wages and benefits, \nrepresenting members in disputes with employers, referring members for construction \nemployment, etc.) both unions regularly advocate for our member’s inter ests in public policy \nvenues.   \nBoth unions are active participants in Commission proceedings where the outcome could impact \nwork opportunities for our members.  Both unions have members who live in Minnesota in the \nservice territory of Minnesota Power.  Both unions represent workers who  build, maintain and \nrepair portions of Minnesota Power’s energy infrastructure on behalf of union -signatory \ncontractors.  Both unions have members  \nThe acquisition as proposed has a number of potential impacts on both unions and our \nmembers.  First, corporate policies relating to procurement and labor standards directly impacts \nthe economic wellbeing of our membership as it determines whether or not t hey will be able to \ngain work opportunities through the construction and maintenance of Minnesota Power’s energy \nassets.  Second, the ability of a utility to raise the adequate capital to deploy new infrastructure \nwill determine whether or not our members will have work opportunities.  The ownership \nstructure of the utility has a direct impact on the ease and cost of raising capital.  Third, our \nmembers who live in Minnesota Power’s service territory are ratepayers and would be impacted \nby any rate changes or conditions that would result from the acquisition.  As such, both unions \nmembers’ legal rights, duties, and privileges are directly impacted by the disposition of this \nproceeding.   \nBoth unions seek joint, full party status in the above -captioned docket to protect the rights and \nwelfare of our members, families and communities, and to ensure that the outcome of the \nproceeding is consistent with the interest of members and the public.  Both unions have a \nunique interest and expertise that can not be represented in this proceeding by other parties.  \nBoth unions understand the rights and responsibilities of parties under Minn. R. 1400.7100 and \nare prepared to meet those requirements.  \n \nDated:  11/15/24    Respectfully Submitted,  \nNate Runke, Regulatory and Political Affairs Coordinator\n International Union of Operating Engineers Local \n49 \n2829 Anthony Lane South  \n     Minneapolis, MN 55418  \n \n \nRichard Kolodziejski, Government Affairs Director  \nNorth Central States Regional Council of Carpenters  \n700 Olive St.   \n     Saint Paul, MN 55130"
