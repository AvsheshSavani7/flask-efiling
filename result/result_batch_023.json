INTRODUCTION \n3 Q. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND BUSINESS ADDRESS. \n4 A. My name is Ellen Lapson, CFA. My business address is 370 Riverside Drive, New York, \n5 New York 10025. \n6 Q. BY WHOM ARE YOU EMPLOYED AND IN WHAT CAPACITY? \n7 A. I am the founder and principal of Lapson Advisory, a private company that is a division \n8 of Trade Resources Analytics, LLC. Through Lapson Advisory, I provide independent \n9 consulting services relating to the financial strength of utilities and infrastructure \n10 companies. I advise client companies on access to capital and debt markets. 1 frequently \n11 testify as an expert witness relating to utility finance and utility capital market matters. \n12 Also, 1 develop and teach executive seminars about utility investment analysis, credit \n13 evaluation, and corporate finance. \n14 Q. PLEASE BRIEFLY DESCRIBE YOUR EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL \n15 EXPERIENCE. \n16 A. I am a Chartered Financial Analyst (\"CFA\") and earned a Master of Business \n17 Administration from New York University Stern School of Business with a specialization \n18 in Accounting. I have worked in the capital markets space with particular focus on \n19 financing or analyzing the finances of regulated public utilities for the past 50 years. The \n20 list of my professional qualifications appears in Exhibit EL-1. \n21 Q. ON WHOSE BEHALF ARE YOU APPEARING IN THIS PROCEEDING? \n22 A. I am appearing on behalf of applicants Sun Jupiter Holdings LLC (\"Sun Jupiter\") and IIF \n23 US Holding 2 LP (\"IIF US 2\") in an application regarding the proposed acquisition of El \n24 Paso Electric Company (\"EPE\") by Sun Jupiter (the \"Proposed Transaction\"). Because \n25 Sun Jupiter is a holding company and IIF US 2 is providing the equity for the Proposed \n26 Transaction, I primarily use \"IIF US 2\" throughout my testimony when discussing the \n27 commitments made in the Proposed Transaction, though the commitments apply equally \n28 to Sun Jupiter. I refer to EPE, Sun Jupiter, and IIF US 2 as the \"Joint Applicants.\" \nLapson — Direct \n453 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 5 of 26 \n1 Q. HAVE YOU PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITY \n2 COMMISSION OF TEXAS (\"COMMISSION\") OR OTHER UTILITY \n3 REGULATORY COMMISSIONS? \n4 A. I have filed written testimony before the Commission in the following proceedings: \n5 • Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. to Amend its Certificate of Convenience and \n6 Necessity to Construct Montgomery County Power Station in Montgomery County, \n7 Docket No. 46416, on behalf of Entergy Texas, Inc.; \n8 • Application of Oncor Electric Delivery LLC for Authority to Change Rates, Docket \n9 No. 46957, on behalf of Oncor; \n10 • Application of Southwestern Public Service for Authority to Change Rates, Docket \n11 No. 47527, in Supplemental Direct Testimony on behalf of Southwestern Public \n12 Service Co.; \n13 • Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. to Change Retail Rates, Docket No. 48371, on \n14 behalf of Entergy Texas, Inc.; \n15 • Application of Texas-New Mexico Power to Change Retail Rates, Docket No. 48401, \n16 on behalf of TNMP; \n17 • Joint Report and Application of Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC, Sharyland \n18 Distribution & Transmission Services, L.L.C., Sharyland Utilities, L.P., and Sempra \n19 Energy for Regulatory Approvals Under PURA §§ 14.101, 37.154, 39.262 and \n20 39.915, Docket No. 48929, on behalf of Sharyland Utilities, L.P.; and \n21 • Application of Centerpoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC for Authority to Change \n22 Rates, Docket No. 49421, on behalf of Centerpoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC. \n23 I have also provided testimony as a financial expert in other state jurisdictions and \n24 at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as summarized in Exhibit EL-1. \n25 Q. WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR YOUR EXPERTISE IN MATTERS RELATING TO \n26 UTILITY RING-FENCING REGIMES, CORPORATE SEPARATION, AND \n27 GOVERNANCE? \n28 A. Before I founded Lapson Advisory in 2012, I was a Senior Director and then a Managing \n29 Director at Fitch Ratings (\"Fitch\"), one of the three prominent credit rating agencies in \n30 the U.S. market. My team established and maintained the credit ratings of investor- \n31 owned electric, gas, and water utilities. For 17 years in that role at Fitch, I performed \n32 credit evaluations and supervised other analysts to rate hundreds of electric, gas, and \n33 water utilities. Also, I supervised and wrote the credit rating methodologies applied in \n34 the investor-owned electric, gas, and water sector including utility ring-fencing criteria. \nLapson — Direct \n454 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 6 of 26 \n1 While at Fitch, I was a member and then the chair of the Criteria Committee that oversaw \n2 Fitch's global corporate rating criteria, including its policies on the credit effects of \n3 corporate structure and ring-fencing. I closely studied the credit criteria and polices of \n4 the two other large credit rating agencies (i.e., Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") \n5 and Standard & Poor's (\"S&P Global Ratings\" or \"S&P\")) with regard to the effects of \n6 corporate structure and ring fencing on their ratings of subsidiary companies. \n7 Prior to joining Fitch Ratings, I was employed for 20 years from 1974 to 1994 in \n8 commercial banking and investment banking where my specialty was structuring \n9 transactions for regulated utilities, utility holding companies, and project financed energy \n10 and natural resource projects, often including bankruptcy-remote special purpose funding \n11 entities, partnership structures, and limited liability companies. \n12 Since founding Lapson Advisory, I have served as an expert witness in regulatory \n13 proceedings involving the merger applications of several large electric or gas utilities on \n14 the topic of ring-fencing and the effect of their corporate structure and governance upon \n15 the utilities' future viability and financial strength.' \n16 Q. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR TESTIMONY IN THIS PROCEEDING? \n17 A. I am testifying as a financial expert on behalf of IIF US 2 and Sun Jupiter regarding the \n18 impact of the Transaction on the future financial condition of EPE and EPE's expected \n19 access to debt and equity capital. I will also evaluate the effectiveness of the Applicants' \n20 proposed ring-fencing and corporate governance commitments to protect the interests of \n21 EPE's customers and the public. \n22 Q.

Evaluating the Ring-Fencing Conditions Proposed by Joint Applicants \n5 V. Conclusion and Recommendations \n6 II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS \n7 I have reviewed the business combination agreed to by EPE and Sun Jupiter and \n8 in particular three financial topics relating to the combination of these entities. \n9 First, EPE as a subsidiary of IIF US 2 will continue to have access to equity \n10 capital funding possibly superior to and at least as good as it now has as an independent \n11 entity. I conclude that IIF US 2 can provide common equity capital to its subsidiary EPE \n12 at least equivalent to EPE's current ability to raise equity capital as an independent \n13 company with shares listed on a national stock exchange. In fact, IIF US 2's ability to \n14 supply equity capital to meet EPE's future needs is possibly superior to EPE's current \n15 capability because equity infusions coming from IIF US 2's investor base would not be \n16 burdened by fees and commissions, legal fees and other overhead would be reduced, and \n17 EPE would not have to pay the bid-asked spread on new equity issues. In addition, it is \n18 likely to the advantage of EPE and EPE's customers that IIF US 2's equity investor base \n19 takes a longer-term investment perspective than typical equity market investors. \n20 Second, EPE will continue to have comparable sources of debt funding from the \n21 debt capital market and bank credit facilities that it has currently. Additionally, given the \n22 size of the Infrastructure Investments Fund,' of which IIF US 2 is a part, and its strong \n23 relationships with the lending community, EPE will not only have access to the same \n24 sources of debt capital as it does today, but I would expect EPE to receive additional \n25 attention and consideration from entities that lend in the debt markets. EPE may benefit \n26 from a larger pool of potential investors in its debt securities. In my opinion, EPE's \n27 credit ratings will be protected from downgrade as a result of the financial protections \n2 Additional detail regarding the Infrastructure Investments Fund, including its investment size and \nfootprint and its specific experience with owning regulated utilities, is provided in the direct testimony of Andrew E. \nGilbert. \nLapson — Direct \n456 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 8 of 26 \n1 included with the Proposed Transaction, although it is quite possible that EPE will \n2 experience a one-notch downgrade of its Moody's rating due to weaker cash flow, \n3 regardless of whether the Proposed Transaction is consummated. As is discussed below, \n4 Moody's placed EPE on negative credit outlook more than a year before the \n5 announcement of the Proposed Transaction, therefore any future downgrade by Moody's \n6 would likely be the result of factors unrelated to the Proposed Transaction. While both \n7 Moody's and S&P took ratings action following the announcement of the merger \n8 agreement, when the Proposed Transaction closes the protection of the credit ratings of \n9 EPE will be aided by the full and complete set of ring-fencing commitments proposed by \n10 the Joint Applicants. \n11 In preparing my Direct Testimony, I compared the ring-fencing provisions \n12 proposed by the Joint Applicants against a systematic and comprehensive list of standards \n13 that reflects my prior experience regarding credit defaults and bankruptcies particularly in \n14 the utility and energy sector. This master list of standards incorporates the guidelines \n15 applied by the three major credit rating agencies. The Joint Applicants' proposed ring- \n16 fencing provisions satisfy every aspect of these standards. Taken together, these \n17 protective provisions will provide strong separation for EPE and EPE's customers and \n18 communities from risk of involuntary consolidation in bankruptcy with Sun Jupiter, IIF \n19 US 2, or any IIF US 2 affiliate. Equally important, the proposed ring-fencing provisions \n20 will enable EPE to retain access to all of its own financial and physical assets and cash \n21 flow so that EPE can properly conduct its business and remain viable, even in the case of \n22 financial distress of Sun Jupiter, IIF US 2, or any IIF US 2 affiliate. \n23 Therefore, I recommend that the Commission approve the Proposed Transaction, \n24 including the proposed protective mechanisms. \n25 III. TRANSACTION IMPACT ON EPE'S FUTURE FINANCES \n26 A. EPE's Current Financial Circumstances \n27 Q. PLEASE DESCRIBE EPE'S CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AS AN \n28 INDEPENDENT INVESTOR-OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY. \n29 A. EPE is a relatively small independent investor-owned utility. Other electric operating \n30 utilities that are comparable in size to EPE are generally subsidiaries of larger holding \nLapson — Direct \n457 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 9 of 26 \n1 company groups, while EPE functions as a stand-alone company with a geographically \n2 concentrated customer base. EPE's shares are traded on the NYSE, where EPE is among \n3 the smallest shareholder-owned companies in the electric and gas utility sector. EPE's \n4 small size is evident from the information provided in Exhibit EL-2, which shows a \n5 comparison of 52 electric and gas utilities ranked by magnitude of market capitalization \n6 (that is, the value of an entity's common equity at the prevailing market price.)3 EPE is \n7 48' out of 52 companies and represents a mere 0.3% of the aggregate market valuation of \n8 the sector. \n9 Q. WHAT IS EPE'S CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION? \n10 A. EPE is solvent and financially sound, with investment grade credit ratings in the broad \n11 category of Baa and BBB from both Moody's and S&P, respectively. 4 \n12 Moody's Baal rating for EPE is only one notch below the sector median rating of \n13 A3 for Moody's portfolio of 111 rated U.S. investor-owned electric operating utilities. \n14 However, the agency placed EPE's rating on Outlook Negative over a year ago on March \n15 26, 2018 due to Moody's expectation that EPE's cash flows will decrease due to the \n16 implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\"), increasing capital \n17 expenditures, and rising dividends. 5 Prior to the announcement of EPE's merger \n18 agreement with Sun Jupiter, Moody's rating outlook for EPE was on Outlook Negative. \n19 In a credit update published on March 27, 2019, Moody's commented that \"[EPE] has an \n20 adequate liquidity profile.\" \n21 S&P rates the credit of EPE at BBB, equivalent to a rating one notch below \n22 Moody's Baal rating. S&P commented in a May 2018 report that \"El Paso Electric has \n23 adequate liquidity and can more than cover its needs for the next 12 months, even if \n24 EBITDA declines by 10%.6 S&P assessed EPE's business risk position as Strong and \n25 financial risk as Significant (using the rating agency's benchmarks for companies of \n3 The 52 North American utilities with publicly-traded equity securities in Exhibit EL-2 were selected by \nBank of America as potential competitors to EPE in the capital market or comparable companies. \n4 The correspondence of the rating scales of Moody's and S&P is presented in Exhibit EL-3. \n5 Moody's, \"Rating Action: Moody's Affirms El Paso Electric at Baal ; Outlook Revised to Negative,\" \nMarch 26, 2018 (Exhibit EL-4.1). \n6 S&P Global Ratings, \"Summary, El Paso Electric Co.,\" May 21, 2018 (Exhibit EL-5.1). \nLapson — Direct \n458 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 10 of 26 \n1 medial volatility). Immediately prior to the announcement of EPE's merger agreement \n2 with Sun Jupiter, S&P's rating outlook was Stable. \n3 Q. WHAT CHALLENGES DO INVESTORS SEE FOR EPE AS AN INDEPENDENT \n4 COMPANY? \n5 A. Equity and fixed income investors generally mention regulatory risk as a concern; they \n6 consider the regulatory jurisdictions of the City of El Paso and New Mexico to be \n7 challenging, and the Texas regulatory environment has been less supportive for integrated \n8 electric utilities like EPE than it has been for transmission and distribution utilities that \n9 are located within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. Another concern is the \n10 heightened capital expenditures that EPE faces in the future, for which external financing \n11 will be required. Tax reform has raised concerns among fixed income investors and \n12 rating agencies about the erosion of EPE's cash flow metrics after implementation of \n13 TCJA and the termination of bonus depreciation; this issue affects credit and fixed \n14 income investment more than it does the equity market. Finally, EPE's small size is \n15 problematic as a trend of consolidation has increased the size of other participants in the \n16 utility sector. Regarding EPE's small size, Moody's commented in its March 2019 \n17 Credit Opinion on EPE: \n18 SMALL SIZE AND SCALE CONSTRAIN THE CREDIT PROFILE \nI 9 [EPE]' s credit profile also factors in its relatively small size and scale as \n20 well as market concentration as it serves about 425,000 customers in a \n21 small area of Texas and New Mexico. Texas accounts for 80% of total \n22 non-fuel revenues, the majority of which are generated in the City of El \n23 Paso, while New Mexico accounts for about 20% of total revenues. \n24 Although [EPE]'s service area is concentrated, we acknowledge that \n25 customer and load growth is expected to continue to surpass national \n26 averages.' \n27 One of the challenges that EPE faces as a relatively small utility is that it must \n28 compete with much larger utilities for access to lenders and attention from equity analysts \n29 and investors. EPE's market capitalization is only 0.3% of the aggregate market \n7 Moody's, \"Credit Opinion: El Paso Electric Company; Update to Credit Analysis,\" March 27, 2019 \n(Exhibit EL-4.2). \nLapson — Direct \n459 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 11 of 26 \n1 capitalization of 52 companies in the utility sector shown in Exhibit EL-2. The top ten \n2 companies in that exhibit comprise approximately 54% of the aggregate value of the \n3 group, and the top twenty companies comprise over 77% of the aggregate valuation. \n4 Investors and analysts have limited time and resources available to cover dozens of \n5 companies, so small companies tend to suffer from a dearth of analytical coverage. IIF \n6 US 2's indirect ownership of EPE and its greater access to equity capital and credit will \n7 resolve this issue. \n8 B. Impact of the Transaction on EPE's Access to Credit \n9 Q. HOW WERE EPE'S CREDIT RATINGS AFFECTED BY THE \n10 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT TO MERGE WITH SUN JUPITER? \n11 A. After the announcement of the agreement between Sun Jupiter and EPE, Moody's and \n12 S&P each took actions on their rating outlooks. The resulting ratings and outlooks are \n13 shown below in Table 1. \n14 Table 1: El Paso Electric Credit Ratings as of July 24, 2019 \nPrior to Transaction  \nMay 31, 2019 August 5, 2019  \nCredit Rating [1] Outlook Status Credit Rating [1] Outlook Status \nMoody's (a) Baal Outlook \nNegative Baal On Review for \nDowngrade \nS&P (b) BBB Stable BBB Outlook Negative \n(a)Moody's long-term senior unsecured debt rating \n(b)S&P's long-term Issuer Credit Rating \n[1] A rating of Baal by Moody's is equivalent to a credit rating of BBB+ by S&P, and \nMoody's Baa2 is equivalent to S&P's BBB rating. For the correspondence of credit rating \nscales of Moody's and S&P, please see Exhibit EL-3. \n15 \n16 \n17 Moody's: Moody's affirmed the rating of Baal but changed EPE's outlook status to \n18 \"On Watch for Possible Downgrade\" from \"Outlook Negative.\" The rationale expressed \nLapson — Direct \n460 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 12 of 26 \n1 in the announcement of that change on July 1 of this year indicates that the expected \n2 decline in credit metrics even in the absence of the merger transaction is the leading \n3 factor while the announced change of ownership is a secondary factor that could spur a \n4 downgrade of EPE's rating. Moody's states: \n5 The review is prompted by a projected weakening in [EPE]'s financial \n6 metrics and credit profile together with uncertainty around the \n7 implications on [EPE]'s credit of a recently announced acquisition of the \n8 utility by Infrastructure Investments Fund (IIF, not rated), an investment \n9 vehicle advised by J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.8 \n10 S&P: In reaction to the merger announcement, S&P changed its outlook from Stable to \n11 Negative, citing the possibility that the combined entity to be formed by the Proposed \n12 Transaction would have higher consolidated debt leverage and uncertainty about the \n13 details of the outcome of the regulatory process. S&P explained the rationale for its \n14 change in outlook as follows: \n15 The negative outlook reflects the potential for [EPE]'s consolidated \n16 financial measures to weaken following the proposed acquisition, \n17 including the possibility that IIF could implement financial policies \n18 toward [EPE] that weaken [EPE]'s credit quality. We will continue to \nI 9 monitor the regulatory approval process and assess the planned funding \n20 strategy for [EPE] and its proposed intermediary holding company as it \n21 • develops. 9 \n22 Q. COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CREDIT \n23 RATING AGENCY'S \"NEGATIVE OUTLOOK\" VERSUS \"ON REVIEW FOR \n24 DOWNGRADE\" OR \"RATING WATCH NEGATIVE\"? \n25 A. Yes. Essentially, rating outlooks communicate a trend over time in underlying credit \n26 fundamentals, while a review for rating change (or rating watch) generally responds to a \n27 specific event or new circumstance. \n28 Rating agencies use outlooks to signal an opinion about the likely trend in the \n29 direction of a future change in ratings. A stable outlook indicates a low likelihood of a \n30 rating change over the medium term. A negative or positive outlook indicates a higher \nMoody's, \"Rating Action: Moody's places El Paso Electric on Review for Downgrade,\" July 1, 2019 \n(Exhibit EL-4.3). \n9 S&P Global Ratings, Research Update, \"El Paso Electric Co. Outlook Revised To Negative From Stable \nOn Acquisition By HF; Ratings Affirmed,\" June 5, 2019. (Exhibit EL-5.2). \nLapson — Direct \n461 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 13 of 26 \n1 likelihood of a rating change in the indicated direction over the medium term. The \n2 outlook may eventually culminate in a change in the rating or restoration of a stable \n3 outlook at the original rating, but the timing is not defined. \n4 Agencies designate ratings as \"on review\" (also known as on \"rating watch\") \n5 when specific events warrant a rating action in the near term, but further information or \n6 analysis is needed to reach a decision on the certainty of a rating change or the magnitude \n7 of the potential change. When a rating is \"On Review for Upgrade\" or \"On Review for \n8 Downgrade,\" a rating committee must resolve the rating as soon as the required \n9 information can be made available. \n10 Q. WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THESE RESPONSES FROM THE CREDIT \n11 RATING AGENCIES? \n12 A. I would say that the rating agency response was mild. First, as I have already mentioned, \n13 there was a significant probability that Moody's would lower EPE's rating to Baa2 from \n14 Baal simply based upon the stand-alone cash flow metrics of EPE, unless EPE is \n15 successful in achieving additional cash flows through the regulatory process to offset the \n16 reduction in cash flow produced by the implementation of TCJA and the elimination of \n17 bonus depreciation, in combination with higher capital expenditures. Moody's explained \n18 its rating rationale as follows: \n19 \"With increasing, partly debt-funded capital expenditures and the ongoing \n20 pressure on cash flow from tax reform, we project a decline in El Paso \n21 Electric's credit metrics\", said Nana Hamilton, Assistant Vice President. \n22 These metrics include a ratio of cash flow from operations before working \n23 capital changes (CFO pre-WC) to debt of around 16% in the near to \n24 medium term, lower than recent historical levels of just above 18%. This \n25 level is weak for the company's Baal rating and more in line with slightly \n26 lower rated vertically integrated peers.1° \n27 This comment suggests that the expected rating for EPE based on its projected cash flow \n28 ratios with or without the Proposed Transaction will be Baa2, Moody's rating equivalent \n29 to the current and expected-to-continue S&P rating of BBB. \n30 Second, S&P's change in outlook from Stable to Negative is the expected \n31 response to an announced transfer of ownership when the perception is that the acquirer \nMoody's, July 1, 2019, Exhib.EL-4.3, op.cit. \nLapson — Direct \n462 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 14 of 26 \n1 (in this case, Sun Jupiter as the proposed immediate parent) is not financially stronger \n2 than the acquired company and when the details of the transaction are still subject to \n3 change through the regulatory process. In my professional opinion, when the Proposed \n4 Transaction closes, S&P will give recognition to the completeness and robustness of the \n5 protective measures IIF US 2 is offering to separate Sun Jupiter, the direct parent of EPE, \n6 from IIF US 2 and to separate EPE from Sun Jupiter and IIF US 2. I explain these \n7 protective mechanisms further in Section IV of my Direct Testimony. The effect of such \n8 strong insulation of EPE from both Sun Jupiter and IIF US 2 will allow S&P to continue \n9 to rate EPE's credit at the current rating of BBB. \n10 Q. WILL SUN JUPITER SEEK CREDIT RATINGS? \n11 A. Not in the near term. It is my understanding that IIF US 2 has no plan to obtain a public \n12 credit rating for Sun Jupiter at this time. In the future, IIF US 2 will need to consider the \n13 economic costs of public ratings versus any market benefits of obtaining that rating. This \n14 is due to the significant fees to maintain public ratings and IIF US 2's ability at present to \n15 meet its funding needs through a multi-year bank credit facility and term loan facility that \n16 have already been committed. Sun Jupiter's moderate total amount of debt of a $625 \n17 million senior secured term loan facility and $75 million senior secured revolving credit \n18 facility could be fulfilled with private placement funding, which may not require a credit \n19 rating for Sun Jupiter. \n20 Q. DOES IIF US 2 HAVE CREDIT RATINGS? \n21 A. No, it does not. \n22 Q. IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION, WILL OWNERSHIP BY IIF US 2 AND \n23 SUN JUPITER HAVE ANY ADVERSE EFFECT ON EPE'S ACCESS TO DEBT \n24 CAPITAL? \n25 A. No. I do not foresee any adverse change in EPE's means of accessing debt capital, \n26 except EPE may decide not to issue public debt in the future. In fact, for the reasons I \n27 previously discussed, EPE is likely to have comparable or greater access to debt funding \n28 as a result of its affiliation with IIF US 2, and being part of the Infrastructure Investments \n29 Fund. \nLapson — Direct \n463 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 15 of 26 \n1 First, EPE will continue to have access to its Revolving Credit Facility, as is \n2 currently the case. Second, it will use the same methods to sell long-term unsecured \n3 bonds to capital market investors in the future as it does at present. I expect that EPE will \n4 retain its current S&P credit rating of BBB. While there is a likely reduction of Moody's \n5 rating from Baal to Baa2, I view that as a consequence of EPE's intrinsic cash flow \n6 circumstances rather than an effect of the Proposed Transaction. A complete and robust \n7 suite of protective measures will insulate EPE's ratings from the debt at Sun Jupiter and \n8 from the activities of IIF US 2 and IIF US 2 affiliates, and that will help to maintain \n9 EPE's ability to borrow. In summary, I foresee no reduction in EPE's access to debt \n10 funding as a consequence of the change in ownership, and EPE's affiliation with IIF US 2 \n11 may actually improve EPE's access to the capital markets. \n12 C. Impact of the Transaction on EPE's Access to Equity \n13 Q. WHAT MEANS DOES EPE HAVE CURRENTLY TO MEET ITS NEEDS FOR \n14 EQUITY CAPITAL? \n15 A. Currently, EPE's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and EPE could \n16 issue common shares on the public market. \n17 Q. HOW WILL EPE OBTAIN INCREMENTAL EQUITY CAPITAL AS A DIRECT \n18 SUBSIDIARY OF SUN JUPITER AND INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF IIF US 2? \n19 A. After the closing of the Proposed Transaction, IIF US 2 will provide infusions of equity \n20 to its indirect subsidiary if new equity is needed to balance EPE's capital structure and \n21 maintain the authorized equity ratio. IIF US 2 is an open-ended private investment \n22 vehicle that receives significant new cash inflows and reinvestments from predominantly \n23 institutional investors seeking to participate in low-volatility infrastructure investment \n24 opportunities. These investors, in turn, represent over 40 million families' retirement \n25 savings. Cash flow becomes available to IIF US 2 for investment because IIF US 2's \n26 cash inflows from investors exceed redemptions by investors, producing substantial net \n27 cash inflows. If equity funding is needed at EPE, IIF US 2 would make an equity \n28 investment in Sun Jupiter, and Sun Jupiter would in turn invest those funds as additional \n29 paid in capital. \nLapson — Direct \n464 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 16 of 26 \n1 Andrew E. Gilbert's testimony indicates that the Infrastructure Investments Fund \n2 received $5.4 billion in new commitments and reinvested distributions in the 12 months \n3 ended June 30, 2019, and invested $2.8 billion during the same period. I consider this a \n4 sign that IIF US 2 has more than ample sources of funding relative to any prospective \n5 needs at EPE. \n6 Q. DO YOU SEE ANY BENEFITS FOR EPE OF OBTAINING EQUITY INFUSIONS \n7 FROM IIF US 2 VIA SUN JUPITER? \n8 A. Yes. This source of funding has very low overhead; there are no fees or commissions to \n9 be paid and no bid-offer spread. Additionally, there would be no minimum size limit on \n10 equity infusions, making it easy for IIF US 2 to meet its commitment to maintain the \n11 authorized ratio of equity to debt from time to time, even if the amount of funding needed \n12 in a particular time period is small. Moreover, if EPE's equity needs are larger than those \n13 of the period 1999-2018 because of the increased level of capital investment expected in \n14 the future and other factors, such as the effects of the TCJA, IIF US 2's investors would \n15 be a more efficient and reliable source of such funding, and likely on better terms, than if \n16 EPE as an independent entity were to launch a common stock offering. \n17 Q. IN WHAT WAYS WOULD AFFILIATION WITH IIF US 2 ADDRESS MAJOR \n18 CHALLENGES THAT EPE CURRENTLY FACES AS AN INDIVIDUAL, \n19 SHAREHOLDER-OWNED COMPANY? \n20 A. In particular, affiliation with IIF US 2 and access to IIF US 2's investor group would be \n21 helpful to EPE with regard to managing and funding future capital investment projects. \n22 EPE is contemplating making investments in renewable energy and forms of energy \n23 efficiency to satisfy customer growth needs and to replace existing energy sources. The \n24 management of IIF US 2 and portfolio companies within IIF US 2 can offer expertise in \n25 managing and financing projects of that type, and EPE will be able to draw upon \n26 experience from within IIF US 2 and the broader Infrastructure Investments Fund. \n27 Second, I have already mentioned that small utilities such as EPE suffer a \n28 disadvantage attracting the attention of, and raising capital, in the equity market. IIF US \n29 2 is well suited to supply common equity to EPE if equity is needed to balance debt \n30 funding for future capital expenditures. \nLapson — Direct \n465 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 17 of 26 \n1 Third, as a part of a private company, EPE will be spared from the demands of \n2 public shareholders for a constant pattern of quarterly growth in reported earnings and \n3 dividends. The investment focus of IIF US 2's investors is oriented to a much longer \n4 time horizon than the short-term focus of mark-to-market investors in the public equity \n5 market. \n6 Also, there may be scale benefits for EPE from association with a larger \n7 enterprise, such as more attention from debt lenders and credit providers, as I discussed \n8 above. Furthermore, IIF US 2 and the Infrastructure Investments Fund has expertise in \n9 renewable development and operations, strong relationships throughout the industry at \n10 both the management and board levels, and a network of professionals to share best \n11 practices on important priorities such as health and safety, cybersecurity, operational \n12 excellence, and other areas of shared interest. \n13 Q. DO YOU ANTICIPATE RISKS OR EXPOSURES TO EPE OF OWNERSHIP BY \n14 IIF US 2 AND SUN JUPITER? \n15 A. No, I do not see risks or exposures that are not fully mitigated by the protective features \n16 that IIF US 2 has proposed in its application. \n17 IV. PROPOSED PROTECTIVE MEASURES \n18 A. Background on Ring-Fencing Protective Measures \n19 Q. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY RING-FENCING? \n20 A. The term describes methods used to separate and protect one enterprise or business \n21 activity from invasion, contagion, or harm due to mingling with other businesses or \n22 activities. \n23 Q: WHY ARE FINANCIAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES APPLIED? \n24 A. Protective ring-fencing methods typically serve one of two purposes: \n25 1. When a financial sponsor bundles together a portfolio of loans or mortgages in \n26 structures that can be financed by issuing loans or securities, ring-fencing \n27 mechanisms separate the bundled loan assets from the bankruptcy risk of the \n28 transaction's sponsor or the seller of the assets. This provides the opportunity to \n29 achieve funding justified by the quality of the underlying assets rather than the credit \nLapson — Direct \n466 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 18, of 26 \n1 of the sponsor or seller. Protective mechanisms are used by the financial service \n2 industry in this context in banking, leasing, real estate development and ownership, \n3 shipping, and transportation to prevent cross-collateralization of different collections \n4 of assets that are financed separately. \n5 2. Ring-fencing structures are also used for a slightly different purpose. In the context \n6 of corporate finance, ring-fencing structures are used to protect a company and its \n7 stakeholders from financial risks associated with its parents, sister companies, or \n8 subsidiaries, while maintaining the company's ability to access necessary capital and \n9 funding for ongoing investment. \n10 In either case, the purpose of the ring fence is to protect the asset portfolio or \n11 business so that the portfolio or business can sustain its viability without interruption or \n12 adverse effects from the potential financial distress of other related entities. In the case of \n13 ring-fencing structures for a company, the ring-fencing also allows for the company to \n14 raise capital on an ongoing basis to fund investment. \n15 Q. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A RING FENCE IN THE UTILITY SECTOR? \n16 A. Electric utilities generally have a legal obligation to reliably operate and maintain their \n17 systems for existing customers and to expand their facilities and systems to meet \n18 customer growth. Thus, some capital expenditures are not discretionary, but are required \n19 so that the utility can fulfill its franchise and satisfy the requirements of the regulatory \n20 authority. These capital investments require access to funding from internal and, in many \n21 cases, external sources. Thus, it is important for the utility to retain access to its own \n22 resources including its bank accounts, accounts receivable, and the ability to draw under \n23 its credit arrangements, even if its parent or an affiliate is under stress. If internal sources \n24 of cash flow are not sufficient, as is often the case, utilities need to access funding from \n25 the debt market. Without adequate protection, the utility's credit worthiness and access \n26 to the debt market could be impaired if its owner is in default or bankruptcy. Ring- \n27 fencing mechanisms have been successfully used to protect utilities from risky parents or \n28 sister companies to ensure the utility can continue to serve its current and future \n29 customers. \nLapson — Direct \n467 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 19 of 26 \n1 Q. WHY HAVE THE JOINT APPLICANTS VOLUNTEERED TO ADOPT RING- \n2 FENCING COMMITMENTS IN THIS PROCEEDING? \n3 A. Ring-fencing commitments will provide a full and robust insulation of EPE from any \n4 liabilities of Sun Jupiter and from IIF US 2 and all other IIF US 2-owned companies. \n5 Currently, EPE is an independent entity owned by public shareholders. As a result of the \n6 Proposed Transaction, EPE will be a direct subsidiary of Sun Jupiter and an indirect \n7 subsidiary of IIF US 2, which has a variety of other holdings as discussed in detail in Mr. \n8 Gilbert's direct testimony. The Joint Applicants have proposed a set of commitments to \n9 protect the financial condition of the operating utility (i.e., EPE) from any potential \n10 exposure related to IIF US 2, Sun Jupiter, and their affiliates. \n11 B. Evaluating the Ring-Fencing Conditions Proposed by the Joint Applicants \n12 Q. IS THERE A METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING A SET OF RING- \n13 FENCING MECHANISMS? \n14 A. Yes, and I believe that it is important to apply a systematic approach to compare an \n15 entity's ring fence to a list of the objectives for the protection of an entity relative to \n16 related companies. To evaluate ring-fencing provisions, I employ a checklist that I \n17 developed while at Fitch Ratings as a leader in the utility rating group. Each rating \n18 agency maintains an internal checklist that its analysts use to assess the effectiveness of \n19 utility ring-fencing practices; there is quite a bit of commonality among the agencies \n20 when it comes to these standards, since the standards are founded upon shared experience \n21 the agencies drew from prior defaults and from bankruptcy court precedents. For use in \n22 my consulting practice, I combined and harmonized the elements that the three major \n23 rating agencies employed in their separate checklists to create a master list of standards to \n24 evaluate the adequacy of intercorporate separation. This list of desirable ring-fencing \n25 practices and policies is provided as Exhibit EL-6. \n26 The master checklist is based on the understanding that in order to safeguard the \n27 viability of a protected company, two types of protection are needed: \n28 (I) Assurance that the protected company will maintain access to its own \n29 assets, both physical and financial, and funding sources, despite the \n30 financial distress or bankruptcy of its parent or affiliate; and \nLapson — Direct \n468 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 20 of 26 \n1 (II) Practices and policies that reduce or eliminate the risk that the \n2 protected company will be drawn into the bankruptcy of a bankrupt parent \n3 or affiliate. \n4 Consequently, the master checklist has two tracks: Track I contains practices that \n5 allow a company (called \"the Protected Company\" in Exhibit EL-6) to preserve its own \n6 identity, to remain viable, to fund itself and defend its own assets and liabilities even if a \n7 parent or affiliate is in distress (page 1 of Exhibit EL-6); and Trck II contains practices \n8 that protect a company from involuntary consolidation with its parent or affiliate in a \n9 bankruptcy proceeding (page 2 of the same exhibit). Fortunately, some practices do \n10 double duty, helping to achieve the objectives of both Tracks I and II. \n11 Q. WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP TRACK I? \n12 A. Track I includes all the factors that allow a subsidiary company within an ownership \n13 group to preserve its independent viability in the event of the financial distress of its \n14 parent or other companies in its group. Within Track I, I identify four categories of \n15 measures. These are: \n16 I-A. The Protected Company's assets are protected from diversion by \n17 having a separate legal identity, separate bank accounts and asset \n18 accounts, with no commingling of assets. Fixed assets needed to \n19 carry out the business should be in the Protected Company's own \n20 name. Transfers of goods, services, and supplies with other \n21 members of the group should be conducted on an arm's length \n22 basis. The Protected Company should not lend to parents or sister \n23 companies. \n24 I-B. The Protected Company should maintain its own access to funding \n25 and to sources of liquidity. This entails having a separate credit \n26 agreement, and drawing under the credit agreement should be \n27 available despite the default of the company's parent or sister \n28 companies. The default by a parent or affiliate should not trigger \n29 a cross default or cross acceleration of the Protected Company's \n30 debt. Independent access to funding is enhanced if the company is \n31 an accepted issuer of debt in its own name in the public or private \n32 debt market and maintaining a credit rating can be helpful to \n33 achieve that objective. \n34 I-C. The Protected Company is insulated from the liabilities of its \n35 parent and sister companies. It does not guarantee the debt or \n36 obligations of other members of its group. The other members of \n37 the group never represent to the public or to counterparties that the \n38 Protected Company is responsible for the obligations of other \nLapson — Direct \n469 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 21 of 26 \n1 group members. (Often, there is some potential joint liability on \n2 the part of the Protected Company as a member of a consolidated \n3 tax return or as a participant in a pension plan with other \n4 companies in its group, which may be acceptable depending upon \n5 the circumstances.) \n6 I-D. The Protected Company protects its viability by limiting its \n7 individual leverage and preserving its individual solvency. \n8 Q. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE ELEMENTS OF TRACK II. \n9 A. Track II involves steps to avoid the involuntary consolidation of the Protected Company \n10 in the bankruptcy of its parent or an affiliate. Several of the practices that are important \n11 in Track I to maintain the company's separate financial viability are also necessary to \n12 avoid involuntary consolidation by way of the doctrine of substantive consolidation. In \n13 an extreme case, a company might be vulnerable to substantive consolidation along with \n14 its bankrupt parent or affiliate if the resources, assets, and liabilities of the two companies \n15 are so entangled and poorly documented that it is difficult for the bankruptcy court to \n16 untangle them. Keeping good books and records and maintaining separate books of \n17 account are important protections. Also, the Protected Company should never represent \n18 to creditors of the parent or affiliate that the Protected Company is responsible for its \n19 affiliate's obligations. Additional elements are listed in Exhibit EL-6, page 2. \n20 Q. HOW HAVE YOU EMPLOYED THE MASTER LIST OF STANDARDS IN THIS \n21 PROCEEDING? \n22 A. Using the standards that appear in the master list as a guideline, I analyzed the ring- \n23 fencing commitments proposed by the Joint Applicants and matched them with the listed \n24 standards that contribute to robust protection. The results of that analysis are presented in \n25 the Exhibit EL-7. \n26 Q. WHAT CONCLUSIONS DID YOU DRAW FROM THIS ANALYSIS? \n27 A. The results of that study appear on Exhibit EL-7. Using this systematic approach reveals \n28 that the ring-fence commitments proposed by the Joint Applicants cover every one of the \n29 standards for a robust protective regime as listed in Exhibit EL-6. In my opinion, the \n30 resulting practices will provide a full and robust separation of EPE from any risks related \n31 to the debt of its direct parent, Sun Jupiter, and from any liabilities or activities of IIF US \nLapson — Direct \n470 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 22 of 26 \n1 2 and IIF US 2's other affiliates. Observing these commitments, EPE will be able to \n2 maintain access to sources of funding and control its own assets and liquidity despite any \n3 potential financial distress of its direct parent Sun Jupiter or its indirect parent, IIF US 2, \n4 or their affiliates. Furthermore, these practices will insulate EPE from exposure to an \n5 involuntary bankruptcy (that is, substantive consolidation in the bankruptcy of its direct \n6 or indirect parent or its affiliates). EPE will be able to maintain access to its own \n7 resources and sustain its business on an individual basis if that becomes necessary. \n8 Q. THE JOINT APPLICANTS HAVE PROPOSED SOME COMMITMENTS THAT \n9 DO NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE STANDARDS FOR ADEQUATE \n10 PROTECTION IN EXHIBIT EL-6. PLEASE EXPLAIN. \n11 A. Additional commitments are proposed by the Joint Applicants over and above those that \n12 promote the continuing viability of EPE despite the potential distress of its direct parent, \n13 ultimate parent, or its affiliates and protect EPE from substantive consolidation in the \n14 bankruptcy of any other entity. These include, among others, voluntary commitments to \n15 maintain local headquarters, to have representation by local management and residents of \n16 the service territory on EPE's Board of Directors, to hold at least one meeting of the \n17 Directors annually in Las Cruces, NM, and to have local Management as the primary \n18 interface with the regulatory authorities. Other commitments are intended to facilitate the \n19 regulatory authorities' ability to regulate EPE and its parent, including the voluntary \n20 commitment to provide access to the books and records of IIF US 2 or IIF US 2's \n21 affiliates to the Commission and NMPRC to the extent that those entities have transfers \n22 or dealings with EPE. While the commitment by IIF US 2 to continue to own EPE for at \n23 least ten years does not provide any ring-fencing protection by itself, Moody's points out \n24 that this commitment may provide some credit support for EPE: \n25 Furthermore, IIF has committed to a 10-year minimum holding period \n26 which helps to alleviate Moody's concern that [EPE]'s credit profile could \n27 be constrained by aggressive financial policies that often come with \n28 ownership by private funds with a short term investment horizon.11 \n\" Moody's, Issuer Comment: El Paso Electric Agrees to be Acquired by Infrastructure Investment Fund,\" \nJune 5, 2019 (Included in Exhibit EL-4). \nLapson — Direct \n471 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 23 of 26 \n1 A non-consolidation opinion regarding the unlikelihood of a substantive consolidation of \n2 EPE in the bankruptcy of Sun Jupiter, IIF US 2 or IIF US 2's affiliates does not in itself \n3 provide any protection against bankruptcy or insolvency, but it can provide assurance to \n4 the regulatory authority in reviewing of Proposed Transaction and may provide comfort \n5 to current and prospective lenders and rating agencies. Finally, there are two \n6 commitments by the Joint Applicants to address the concerns of labor. \n7 Q. DOES THE SUPERVISION OF THE COMMISSION ENHANCE CONFIDENCE \n8 IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROTECTIVE COMMITMENTS? \n9 A. Yes. The Commission's controls in such areas as the utility's transactions with affiliates \n10 and issuance of debt provide added assurance to creditors and credit rating agencies of \n11 the strength of the ring-fencing commitments. \n12 Q. WHAT EFFECT DO YOU EXPECT THE PROPOSED PROTECTIONS WILL \n13 HAVE UPON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF EPE? \n14 A. It is my opinion that the Joint Applicants' strong protective plan that is proposed will \n15 enable EPE's credit ratings and reputation in the credit market to avoid any adverse \n16 consequences of ownership by Sun Jupiter and IIF US 2. IIF US 2 currently does not \n17 plan to seek public credit ratings for itself or for Sun Jupiter. Nonetheless, Moody's and \n18 S&P internally will formulate unpublished \"implied\" ratings for Sun Jupiter as a \n19 component in their rating evaluation of EPE. It is likely that Sun Jupiter's rating would \n20 be lower than and dependent upon the rating of EPE. \n21 Because the ring-fencing commitments will provide a full and robust insulation of \n22 EPE from any liabilities of Sun Jupiter and from IIF US 2 and all other IIF US 2-owned \n23 companies, Moody's will analyze EPE on a stand-alone basis and will not attribute the \n24 debt of Sun Jupiter or IIF US 2 to EPE when formulating the rating of EPE. That is, I \n25 expect that Moody's credit rating of EPE will be consistent with EPE's individual \n26 financial condition and will not be subject to any constraint due to group linkage. \n27 However, ring-fencing will not protect EPE from a downgrade of a single notch by \n28 Moody's to Baa2 from Baal if there is erosion in EPE's individual cash flow metrics and \n29 key credit ratios that is unrelated to the change in ownership. \nLapson — Direct \n472 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 24 of 26 \n1 S&P follows a different methodology; it is more likely to assess the consolidated \n2 financial statements of EPE along with its direct parent Sun Jupiter and produce a \n3 consolidated financial risk score that considers the added debt at Sun Jupiter. However, I \n4 predict that will not affect S&P's current BBB credit rating of EPE because S&P will \n5 take into consideration the robust suite of protective measures. S&P has recently \n6 instituted a new group credit methodology applicable to holding companies and operating \n7 companies in, the utility sector and certain other sectors.'2 Applying the new guidelines, \n8 S&P may determine the rating of EPE to be at either one, two or three notches above the \n9 implied consolidated issuer credit rating, but no higher than EPE's standalone credit \n10 profile. I estimate that the strength of the ring-fencing commitments proposed by the \n11 Joint Applicants would allow the rating of EPE to be at least two notches higher than the \n12 group rating. We know that S&P currently views EPE on a standalone basis at a BBB \n13 rating, and I do not anticipate any increase or reduction in EPE's S&P rating as a result of \n14 the Proposed Transaction. \n15 V. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n16 Q. PLEASE SUMMARIZE YOUR DIRECT TESTIMONY. \n17 A. The Proposed Transaction creates no new risks to EPE or to EPE's shareholders. After \n18 the closing, EPE will have at least similar and possibly superior access to common equity \n19 funding via Sun Jupiter and IIF US 2, whenever it needs to raise equity capital in the \n20 future. Furthermore, EPE will have comparable access to the debt capital and superior \n21 access to bank credit as an operating utility subsidiary of IIF US 2 (especially as part of \n22 the Infrastructure Investments Fund) relative to its current situation as an individual \n23 company. Investors and credit rating agencies will not have reason for concerns that EPE \n24 will be adversely affected by the debt obligations of IIF US 2 or Sun Jupiter, thanks to the \n25 full array of protective measures that IIF US 2 has proposed in its application. \n26 After reviewing the protective measures proposed by the Joint Applicants, I \n27 conclude that these measures will offer excellent and robust insulation. They will \n28 provide strong separation for EPE and EPE's customers and communities from risks of \n12 S&P Global, \"General Criteria: Group Rating Methodology,\" July 1, 2019 (Exhibit EL-8). \nLapson — Direct \n473 \nDOC Exhibit 314\nPage 25 of 26 \n1 involuntary consolidation in bankruptcy with Sun Jupiter, IIF US 2, or any IIF US 2 \n2 affiliate. Also, the proposed ring-fencing provisions will assure that EPE maintains \n3 access to all of its own resources and cash flow so that EPE can conduct its business and \n4 remain viable, even in the case of financial distress of Sun Jupiter, IIF US 2, or any IIF \n5 US 2 affiliate. \n6 Therefore, I recommend that the Commission approve the Proposed Transaction \n7 and adopt the protective measures as proposed by the Joint Applicants. \n8 Q.

Please state your name and business address . 2 \nA. My name is Ellen Lapson.  My business address is 370 Riverside Drive, New York, 3 \nNew York 10025. 4 \n2. Q. By whom are you employed and in what capacity? 5 \nA. I am the founder and principal of Lapson Advisory, a private company that is a 6 \ndivision of Trade Resources Analytics, LLC.  Through Lapson Advisory, I provide 7 \nindependent consulting services relating to the financial strength of utilities and 8 \ninfrastructure companies.  I advise client companies on access to capital and debt 9 \nmarkets.  I frequently testify as an expert witness relating to utility finance and 10 \nutility capital market matters.   11 \n3. Q. Please briefly describe your educational and professional experience. 12 \nA. I am a Chartered Financial Analyst (“CFA”) and earned a Master of Business 13 \nAdministration from New York University Stern School of Business with a 14 \nspecialization in Accounting.  I have worked in the capital markets space with a 15 \nparticular focus on financing and analyzing the finances of regulated public utilities 16 \nfor the past 50 years.  The list of my professional qualifications appears in Exhibit 17 \nEL-1. 18 \n4. Q. On whose behalf are you appearing in this proceeding ? 19 \nA. I am appearing on behalf of Petitioners IIF US Holding 2 LP (“IIF US 2”), NJ 20 \nBoardwalk Holdings LLC (“Boardwalk”), and Boardwalk Merger Sub, Inc. 21 \n(“Merger Sub”) in an application regarding the proposed acquisition of South 22 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 2 of 28 \n Jersey Industries, Inc. (“SJI”) , and its two regulated public utilities Elizabethtown 1 \nGas Company (“ETG”) and South Jersey Gas Company (“SJG”), by Boardwalk 2 \n(the “Proposed Transaction”).  I refer to SJI , ETG, SJG, Boardwalk, Merger Sub, 3 \nand IIF US 2 as the “Joint Petitioners .”   4 \n5. Q. What is the basis for your expertise in matters relating to utility ring -fencing 5 \nregimes, corporate separation, and governance?  6 \nA. Before I founded Lapson Advisory in 2012, I was a Senior Director and then a 7 \nManaging Director at Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), one of the three prominent credit 8 \nrating agencies in the U.S. market.  My team established and maintained the credit 9 \nratings of investor -owned electric, gas, and water utilities.  For 17 years in that role 10 \nat Fitch, I performed credit evaluations and supervised other analysts  to rate 11 \nhundreds of electric, gas, and water utilities.  Also, I supervised and wrote the credit 12 \nrating methodologies applied in the investor -owned electric, gas, and water sector 13 \nincluding utility ring -fencing criteria.  While at Fitch, I was a member an d then the 14 \nchair of the Criteria Committee that oversaw Fitch’s global corporate rating criteria, 15 \nincluding its policies on the credit effects of corporate structure and ring -fencing.  16 \nI closely studied the credit criteria and polices of two other large credit rating 17 \nagencies ( i.e., Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s 18 \n(“S&P Global Ratings” or “S&P”) r egard ing the effect of corporate structure and 19 \nring-fencing  on the financial viability  of subsidiary companies  and the separation 20 \nof credit ratings within corporate groups. 21 \nPrior to joining Fitch, I was employed for 20 years ( from 1974 to 1994) in 22 \ncommercial and investment banking.  As a banker, I  structured  transactions for 23 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 3 of 28 \n regulated utilities, utility holding companies, and project -financed energy and 1 \nnatural resource projects, frequently  including bankruptcy- remote special purpose 2 \nfunding entities, partnership structures, and limited liability companies.  3 \nSince founding Lapson Advisory, I have served as an expert witness in 4 \nregulatory proceedings involving the merger applications of several large electric 5 \nand gas utilities on the topic of ring -fencing and the effect of their corporate 6 \nstructure upon the utilities’ future viability and financial strength.   7 \n6. Q. Have you previously testifie d before the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities 8 \n(“BPU” or the “Board”) or other utility regulatory commissions?  9 \nA. Yes, I previously filed written testimony before the Board in BPU Docket No. 10 \nEM14060581, I/M/O the Merger of Exelon Corp. and Pepco Holdings, Inc ..  I have 11 \nalso provided testimony as a financial expert before multiple other state regulatory 12 \nagencies and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as summarized in 13 \nExhibit EL-1. 14 \n7. Q. What is the purpose of your Direct T estimony in this proceeding?  15 \nA. I am testifying as a financial expert on behalf of the Joint Petitioners  regarding the 16 \nimpact of the Proposed Transaction on the future financial condition of SJI’s two 17 \nNew Jersey natural gas utilities , ETG  and SJG, and their  immediate parent , SJI 18 \nUtilities , Inc. (“SJIU”), particularly as it relates  to their access to debt and equity 19 \ncapital.  I frequently refer to ETG and SJG as “ the Utilities”.  Finally, I also evaluate 20 \nthe effectiveness of the Joint Petitioners’  proposed ring- fencing and gov ernance 21 \ncommitments  (included within the broader package of Merger Commitments)  to 22 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 4 of 28 \n protect the interests of the Utilities, their customers  and the communities they 1 \nserve.1 2 \n8. Q. How is your Direct T estimony organized?  3 \nA. The remainder of my Direct T estimony  is comprised of the following sections:  4 \n• Executive summary and conclusions (Section II);  5 \n• Financial i mpact of the Proposed Transaction on the Utilities  (Section III)  6 \no Current Financial Status of SJI, ETG, and SJG 7 \no Expected  Transaction Impact s  8 \n• Proposed Protective Measures (Section IV)  9 \no Background on Ring- Fence protective m easures  10 \no Evaluating the Joint Petitioners’  proposed ring-f encing 11 \ncommitments   12 \n• Conclusions and Recommendation (Section V)  13 \n9. Q. Are you sponsoring any exhibits as part of your Direct Testimony?  14 \nA. Yes.  Submitted with my Direct Testimony are Exhibits EL -1 through EL -9, which 15 \nwere prepared by me or under my direct supervision.  16 \nII. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  17 \n10. Q. Please summarize your D irect T estimony .   18 \nA. I have reviewed the Proposed Transaction agreed to by S JI and Boardwalk (which 19 \nis indirectly owned by IIF US 2 ) regarding the future financial strength and viability 20 \nof the Utilities  after Boardwalk becomes the sole shareholder of SJI, and have 21 \nseveral con clusions.  22 \n \n1  The Merger Commitments are those the Joint Petitioners are making in connection with the requested approval of \nthe Merger from the Board, and which are attached to the Joint Petition as Exhibit C.  \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 5 of 28 \n First, IIF US 2, one of the two master partnerships of the  Infrastructure 1 \nInvestments Fund (“IIF”), is an appropriate  indirect owner2 for SJI and for SJI’s  2 \ntwo gas distribution utility subsidiaries , ETG and SJG .  IIF is a long- term private 3 \ninvestment vehicle that invests long- term capital provided predominantly by 4 \ninstitutional investors (namely pension funds and insurance companies) into 5 \ninfrastructure companies, including utilities, in developed countries.  I expect that 6 \nownership by IIF US 2 will promote the stability of SJI and the Utilities  by focusing 7 \non a long- term business plan for reasonable returns, not an exit in five to seven  8 \nyears as is typical for closed -ended private equity funds.    9 \nSecond, as indirect subsidiaries of IIF US 2, ETG and SJG will have access 10 \nto equity capital that is in all likelihood  superior to the access that  they now have 11 \nas subsidiaries of SJI , which is currently a public ly traded  company on the New 12 \nYork Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “SJI.”  IIF US 2 can  13 \nprovide common equity capital to meet the Utilities’ future capital needs with 14 \ngreater ease and at lower cost than  SJI’s current access to equity capital as a public  15 \ncomp any with shares listed on a national stock exchange .  Moreover, equity 16 \ncommitments coming from IIF US  2’s investor base would entirely avoid 17 \ntransaction costs, issue discounts and volatility associated with public market 18 \nissuances because fees and commissi ons, legal costs, and other  issuance costs that 19 \nare typically incurred in public equity issuances would be eliminated  under IIF US 20 \n2 ownership.  In addition, IIF US 2’s equity investor base tends to take a longer - 21 \nterm investment perspective than typical eq uity market investors , eliminating the 22 \n \n2 IIF US 2 has formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Boardwal k, a special -purpose entity, to hold 100% of the equity \ninterests in SJI.  \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 6 of 28 \n quarter -to-quarter focus of public markets and allowing SJI to focus on running 1 \ntheir business.  2 \nThird , the Utilities  will continue to have access to  debt funding from the 3 \ndebt capital market and bank credit facilitie s that is in all likelihood  superior to that 4 \nwhich  they have  currently.  The Joint Petitioners  propose to enhance the role  of 5 \nSJIU, the direct parent of ETG and SJG, by making SJIU a  ring-fenced  financing 6 \nentity that can assist ETG and SJG in borrowing more efficiently on a joint basis.3  7 \nETG and SJG may attain economies by consolidating the ir borrowing and lending 8 \nand by participating in a regulated utility money pool  to lower short -term borrow ing 9 \ncosts —resulting in pricing efficiencies, lower costs and operational efficiencies that 10 \nultimately inure to the benefit of utility customers .  Furthermore, given the size of 11 \nIIF and its strong relationships with the lending community, the Utilities will not 12 \nonly have access to the same sources of debt capital as they do  today, but I would 13 \nexpect the Utilities and SJIU  to benefit from increased attention from the major 14 \nlenders  that do business across the IIF portfolio of companies, which should result 15 \nin a larger pool of potential  lenders and buyers of  the Utilities’  debt resulting in 16 \nbetter terms for the Utilities and therefore their customers .   17 \nFourth, the Utilities will retain and enhance their current financial viability 18 \nand credit standing after the Proposed Transaction.  I anticipate  that Moody’s will 19 \naffirm its A3 long- term credit rating of SJG  at the current level  and expect that by 20 \nthe time that the Proposed Transaction closes, S&P  (based on its current group 21 \n \n3 See e.g ., Commitment No. 19, which provides: “ SJIU will be retained in the ownership chain between SJI and SJG \nand ETG for so long as Boardwalk  indirectly owns ETG and SJG.  SJIU w ill directly own  the equity interests in ETG \nand SJG .  SJIU will be entitled to lend money to SJG and ETG .  SJIU’s business will be limited to owning the equity \ninterests in ETG and SJG and performing related activities for the benefit of ETG and SJG.”  \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 7 of 28 \n rating s methodology) will affirm and may  ultimately upgrade its ratings of ETG 1 \nand SJG.  2 \nFinally , my Direct  Testimony  compares the ring- fencing provisions 3 \nproposed by the Joint Petitioners  against a systematic and comprehensive set  of 4 \nstandards for intercompany separation, a framework that is based upon the 5 \nstandards applied  by major credit rating agencies and historical experience in past 6 \ncredit defaults in the utility sector.  The Joint Petitioners’  proposed ring- fencing 7 \nprovisions satisfy every aspect of the framework .  Taken together, these protective  8 \nprovisions will provide strong separation for the Utilities from the risk of 9 \ninvoluntary bankruptcy consolidation with SJI, Boardwalk, IIF US 2, or any IIF US 10 \n2 affiliate s.  Equally important, the proposed ring- fencing provisions will assure 11 \nthat ETG and SJG  will retain access to their  own financial and physical assets and 12 \ncash flow so that each company can properly conduct its business and serve its 13 \ncustomers , even in the case of financial distress of SJI, Boardwalk, IIF US 2, or any 14 \naffiliate of IIF US 2.  Therefore, I recommend that the BPU  approve the Proposed 15 \nTransaction, including the proposed ring -fencing  mechanisms  as outlined in the 16 \nMerger Commitments .  17 \nIII. FINANCIAL  IMPACT OF THE  PROPOSED  TRANSACTION ON THE 18 \nUTILITIES  19 \nA. Current Financial Circumstances of SJI, ETG and SJG  20 \n11. Q. Please describe the current structure and business of SJI.  21 \nA.  S JI is a small investor- owned utility  holding company.  Its common shares  are 22 \ntraded on the N YSE .  The market value of SJI’s common equity was approximately 23 \n$2.7 billion prior to announcement of the Proposed Transaction, placing  SJI among 24 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 8 of 28 \n the smallest participants in the U.S. gas distribution utility sector.4  SJI’s  two gas 1 \ndistribution utilities ETG and SJG together contributed over 90% of SJI’s 2 \ncontinuing net income in 2021.  Non -utility businesses owned by other SJI 3 \nsubsidiaries include energy and gas marketing, gas storage and transportation, and 4 \nrenewable gas development.  SJI management forecasts growth in its non -utility 5 \nlines of business and estimates that in  2022-2025 the regulated utility share of net 6 \nincome will be 70 -80%, while non-utility businesses will provide approximately 7 \n20-30% of net income.5  8 \n12. Q. What is  your assessment of the financial  condition of SJI’s regulated natural 9 \ngas distribution utilities – ETG and  SJG? 10 \nA.  ETG and SJG are financially sound in keeping with the norms of US regulated 11 \npublic utilities.  The Utilities maintain equity that is consistent with the capital 12 \nstructure authorized by the BPU  for ratemaking purposes .  They have adequate 13 \nliquidity, each having access to borrowing under a revolving credit facility that is 14 \npart of a larger credit facility shared with  SJI, but the facility provides distinct sub- 15 \nlimits for each of the Utilities  and SJI.  Each of ETG , SJG, and SJI  has credit ratings 16 \nfrom S&P, while  SJG also is rated by Moody’s .  Each has repeatedly issued its own 17 \nlong- term debt via private placements.  18 \n13. Q. Please describe the current financial condition of SJI.  19 \nA.  SJI is financially sound and has adequate liquidity.  SJI issued  debt to finance a 20 \nportion of the purchase of the  assets  of ETG in 2018 and thereafter  issued debt in 21 \n \n4 See Exhibit EL -2, Market Capitalization of Participants in U.S. Gas Distribution Utility Sector.  \n5 Investors presentation, “Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Presentation, February 24, 2022”, Exhibit EL -3. \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 9 of 28 \n part to f inance  increased investment in certain  non- regulated projects that are not 1 \nyet producing mature cash flows.  Also, SJI’s 20% invest ment in the development 2 \nof a pipeline project occasioned a net impairment cost of $85.7 million in 2021.  In 3 \n2020-2021, SJI issued equity securities and forward equity units which has reduced 4 \nparent company debt leverage.  5 \n14. Q. What are the U tilitie s’ current credit ratings ? 6 \nA.  T able 1 below shows the  Utilities’ credit ratings and compares them  with the credit 7 \nrating of their parent, SJI.  8 \nTable 1:   Current Long- Term Credit Ratings * 9 \n    \n Moody's   S&P  S&P  \n Senior Unsecured \nIssuer Credit   Issuer Credit \nRating  Stand -alone \ncredit profile  \nUtilities:          \nElizabethtown Gas  nr  BBB  a- \nSouth Jersey Gas  A3   BBB  a- \nParent:          \nSouth Jersey Industries  nr  BBB  bbb  \n  SJI Group Credit Rating  nr   BBB    \nNotes:   *Ratings as of April 22, 2022.  nr:  Not rated.  \n   \nFor an explanation of the correspondence of the ratings symbols used by Moody’s 10 \nand S&P, please see Exhibit EL -4. 11 \n15. Q. Please explain the difference between S&P’s issuer credit ratings of ETG  and 12 \nSJG versus their “stand -alone credit profiles ”. 13 \nA.  The credit rating shown in the column “ S&P Issuer Credit Rating ” for the Utilities 14 \nis the formal, publicly disclosed rating of senior unsecured debt and credit that 15 \nappears on S&P’s public ratings website.  The “stand -alone credit profile” is a score 16 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 10 of 28 \n or ranking that is disclosed  to subscribers of S&P’s service, and it is identified as a 1 \ncomponent in S&P’s process of assigning ratings to entities  within  a consolidated 2 \ngroup of companies.  Currently, S&P’s rating of ETG and SJG relies primarily upon 3 \nthe consolidated group profile.  The corporate structure proposed by the Joint 4 \nPetitioners combined with a systematic application of  ring-fencing commitments 5 \nmay over  the long term result in more favorable credit ratings for ETG and SJG 6 \nthan can be achieved at present .  7 \n16. Q. In response to news of the Proposed Transaction , did S&P  or M oody’s alter 8 \ntheir credit ratings or outlooks for the SJI companies that they rate?   9 \nA.  Both agencies published rating comments following the announcement.  S&P’s 10 \ncredit outlook for SJI, SJG, and ETG was “Stable” prior to the announcement, but 11 \non February 25, 2022, S&P placed all three ratings on a negative  CreditWatch 12 \nstatus.  S&P ’s rationale for  the CreditWatch status is as follows:   13 \nThe negative CreditWatch primarily reflects the uncertainty 14 \naround the company's leverage under its future 15 \norganizational structure, which could lead it to maintain 16 \nweaker consolidated financial measures.  6 17 \nMoody’s rating outlook of SJG, the only company in the group rated by 18 \nMoody’s, was “Stable” before the announcement.   Moody’s affirmed SJG’s  ratings 19 \nand stable outlook after the announcement of the proposed merger transaction.  20 \nMoody’s rationale for its  rating affirmation is  that the details of the capital structure 21 \nand integration plans a re still uncertain, but sta ted:  22 \n…we expect IIF to include ring -fencing commitments  in its 23 \napplication to New Jersey state regulators for transaction 24 \n \n6 S&P Global Ratings, “Research Update: South Jersey Industries Inc. and Subsidiaries’ Ratings Placed on \nCreditWatch Negative on Acquisition by IIF”, February 25, 2022.  Exhibit EL -6. \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 11 of 28 \n approval later this year. We view such provisions, designed 1 \nto separate the utility’s operational and financial activities 2 \nfrom those of its new private equity owner and its other 3 \naffiliates, to be credit positive, if implemented. 7 4 \n17. Q. Were the comments and rating actions of S&P  or Moody’s typical responses 5 \nto a merger announcement ? 6 \nA.  Yes, they were absolutely typical and not unexpected.  Although each agency took 7 \na different course of ac tion (S&P placing all the ratings on a Negative CreditWatch 8 \nstatus and Moody’s noting the announcement but affirming the ratings and the 9 \nrating outlook),  either of these approaches is a normal  reaction by a credit rating 10 \naction  reacting to a merger agreement .  Each agency used a different way of 11 \nindicating to the investment public that there are many details still to be learned 12 \nabout the structure of the Proposed T ransaction, the financing, the ring- fencing 13 \nmechanisms and the BP U’s regulatory response.   14 \nB. Expected Transaction Impacts  15 \n18. Q. What do you expect will be the acceptance in the financial market of IIF US  2 16 \nas the future private owner of SJI? 17 \nA.  While the equity markets will no longer be applicable to SJI, I anticipate that IIF 18 \nUS 2 will be accepted  favorably as a suitable owner for SJI  by fixed income 19 \ninvestors, credit rating agencies , and liquidity providers.  First, investors are already 20 \nfamiliar and comfortable with IIF US 2’s role as the sole indirect owner of El Paso 21 \nElectric Company since July 29, 2020.  Second, IIF US 2 is guided by JP Morgan 22 \nInvestment Management, a reputable and highly regarded advisor in the investment 23 \n \n7 Moody’s, Issuer Comment, “South Jersey Gas Company, Announced Acquisition by Infrastructure Investments Fund \nhas No Immediate Impact”, February 25, 2022.  Exhibit EL -7 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 12 of 28 \n community.  Third, the investors in IIF number over 1,000 conservative investors, 1 \nincluding pension funds, insurers, endowments, private wealth funds, and similar 2 \nlarge and respected investors.8  Fourth, the Joint Petitioner s have proposed a 3 \ncommitment to keep the local New Jersey management of SJI and the Utilities in 4 \nplace.  5 \n19. Q. Do you foresee any disadvantage to ownership of SJI by a private owner? 6 \nA. No.  I do not.  To the contrary, private ownership has an advantage  for utilities and 7 \ninfrastructure companies in that the company’s valuation to the investors i s not 8 \nmark ed to daily  trading market valuation s of the shares.  T herefore, investors like 9 \nIIF US 2  can take a long -term investment focus and do not experience  any pressure 10 \nfor short- term mark -to-market equity performance.   Stated simply, the Utilities will 11 \nbe able to focus on their core business of providing safe, reliable, cost effective and 12 \nsustainable service to their customers without worrying about the quarter -to-quarter 13 \nvolatility of a small cap stock.  14 \n20. Q. When ETG  and SJG have future need for additional equity capital, what will 15 \nbe their source of new equity investment ?   16 \nA.  After the closing of the Proposed Transaction, IIF US 2 intends to provide infusions 17 \nof equity to its indirect subsidiary as required for, among other things, growth, 18 \nmodernization, safety and if new equity is needed to balance the U tilities ’ capital 19 \nstructure s.  IIF US 2 is an open- ended private investment vehicle that on an ongoing 20 \nbasis receives significant new cash inflows and reinvestments from predominantly 21 \ninstitutional investors seeking to participate in low -volatility infrastructure 22 \n \n8 See the Direct Testimony of Andrew Gilbert for additional information regarding IIF investors.  \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 13 of 28 \n investment opportunities.  These investors, in turn, represent over 60 million 1 \nfamilies’ retirement savings.  Cash flow becomes available to IIF US 2 for 2 \ninvestment because IIF US 2’s cash inflows from investors exceed redemptions by 3 \ninvestors, producing substantial net cash inflows.  If equity funding is needed at the 4 \nUtilities , IIF U S 2 would make an equity investment in Boardwalk , and Boardwalk 5 \nwould in turn invest those funds as additional paid in capital.  It is worth noting that 6 \nprivate equity issuance through IIF US 2 will be more efficient and less costly than 7 \nSJI’s current proc ess of public equity issuance, by for example avoiding 8 \nunderwriting fees. 9 \n21. Q. When the U tilities need equity capital, do you foresee a risk that IIF US 2 and 10 \nits investors will not provide additional equity ?   11 \nA.  I have no reason to believe that will be the case.  However, I would note further 12 \nthat any such risk is essentially no different from the current situation facing the 13 \nUtilities  when they  seek new equity capital from the public market.  While there is 14 \nno obligation by any public market investors to buy newly issued shares of SJI, it 15 \nis reasonable to assume that the BPU  will authorize rates for ETG and SJG that are 16 \nlikely to produce a return on investment commensurate with the associated risks 17 \n(that is, competitive with returns available in the market on investments with 18 \ncomparable risk), as is the BPU ’s responsibility.  If this is so, then investors in IIF 19 \nwill be motivated to invest in new equity in ETG and SJG to the same extent or a 20 \ngreater extent than investors at large in the public market.   21 \nAdditionally, given IIF’s scale, diverse and stable investor base and track 22 \nrecord of providing equity to existing portfolio companies, I view receiving equity 23 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 14 of 28 \n from IIF as being more beneficial than issuing equity in the public markets.  IIF has 1 \nno practical minimum size limit on equity infusions, which is not always the case 2 \nin public equity issuances, where issuances typically need to reach a certain size in 3 \norder to garner attention from public investors.  Similarly , ETG and SJG should 4 \nhave greater access t o smaller amounts of capital on a more frequent basis rather 5 \nthan timing projects to aggregate capital needs sufficient to justify the costs and 6 \nresources required to access the capital markets.  Finally, Andrew Gilbert’s Direct 7 \nTestimony indicates that, for the 12 months ending December 31, 2021, IIF 8 \nreceived $ 9.0 billion in new commitments and reinvested distributions  from 9 \ninvestors and invested approximately $2.0 billion  of equity in new acquisitions and 10 \ninto its existing portfolio compa nies during the same time period.  I consider this a 11 \nsign that IIF has more than ample sources of funding relative to any prospective 12 \nneeds at SJI or the Utilities.  13 \n22. Q. Will ETG  and SJG be able to access debt capital in the debt market under the 14 \nnew ownersh ip?  15 \nA.  Yes.  ETG and SJG will have the same means for raising debt capital in the future 16 \nas they have currently ; their main avenue for long- term debt issuance has been 17 \nthrough private placements, and in the case of SJG, subsequent registration of the 18 \nbonds.  That is likely to be the case going forward.  Additionally, IIF has deep 19 \nrelationships and trust in the lending community (at a larger scale tha n ETG and 20 \nSJG currently have), which relationships are shared across its portfolio companies .  21 \nFor example,  in 2021, IIF portfolio companies closed $4.9 billion  of debt facilities 22 \nthrough new financing or refinancing activities.  ETG and SJG would be able to 23 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 15 of 28 \n access those relationships as indirect subsidiaries of IIF US 2 .  Another favorable 1 \nchange that I forese e is that ETG and SJG will have the opportunity over time to 2 \nraise their S&P  credit  ratings by at least one notch, approaching the stand -alone 3 \ncredit profile of each U tility, in recognition of the integrated set of ring -fencing  4 \ncommitments that the Joint Petitioner s have proposed to further enhance the 5 \nprotections contained in SJI’s current ring- fencing measures .   6 \n23. Q. Do you expect any increase in Moody’s ratings of SJG?  7 \nA.  No. I anticipate  that Moody’s will acknowledge favor ably the Joint Petitioners’ 8 \nring-fencing commitments and all other terms of the Transaction and will affirm its 9 \ncurrent r ating of SJG.  10 \n24. Q. What will be the sources of short -term liquidity for ETG and SJG after the 11 \nchange in ownership?  12 \nA.  SJG and ETG will continue to have committed revolving credit facilities for their 13 \nliquidity needs, access to which is not contingent upon the credit ratings or default 14 \nstatus of the other utility or of SJIU, SJI, Boardwalk, or IIF US 2.  Also, SJG and 15 \nETG may form a utility-only money pool along with SJIU (subject to authorization 16 \nby the BPU ).  I expect that the Utilities’ access to short- term liquidity will be at 17 \nleast equivalent to their current status, and it could potentially be improved via an 18 \nefficient money pool.  19 \nIV. PROPOSED PROTECTIVE MEASURES  20 \nA. Background on Intercorporate Separation ( Ring -Fencing )  21 \n25. Q. What is  mean t by ring -fencing?  22 \nA. The term describes methods used to separate and protect one enterprise or business 23 \nactivity from  invasion, contagion, or harm due to mingling with other related 24 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 16 of 28 \n entities .  A more formal description is  intercorporate separation, but the term “ ring- 1 \nfencing ” is frequently used .  2 \n26. Q.  When  and why are ring -fencing protections needed by  companies within an 3 \naffiliated group?  4 \nA. Protective ring -fencing methods typically serve one of two purposes.  First, in the 5 \ncontext of corporate finance and corporate structure, r ing-fencing mechanisms  are 6 \nused to protect a company and its stakeholders from financial risks associated with 7 \nthe co mpany’s parent, affiliated  companies, or subsidiaries.9  Second, another  8 \ncontext for ring- fencing is when a financial sponsor (the seller) bundles together a 9 \nportfolio of loans or mortgages and sells them to a shell entity  (the purchaser) that 10 \nfinances the purchase by issuing loans or securities  backed solely by the strength 11 \nof the portfolio assets.  In the context of banking, leasing, and real estate ownership, 12 \nsuch mechanisms separate the purchaser and its assets from exposure to the 13 \nbankruptcy risk of the sponsor or seller of the assets.  This allows the funding of 14 \nthe assets based solely upon the quality of the asset portfolio, unaffected by the 15 \nlower credit of the sponsor or seller. 16 \nIn either of these situation s, the purpose of the ring- fencing mech anisms  is 17 \nto safeguard  a protected entity (a business or asset portfolio) so that the protected 18 \nentity  can sustain its viability without interruption or adverse effects from the 19 \npotential financial distress of other related entities.   20 \n \n9 In this testimony, the term “corporate” in the context of “corporate structure,” “intercorporate separati on,” or \n“corporate group” refers not only to entities structured as corporations but also to partnerships, limited partnerships, \nlimited liability companies (“LLCs”), and related forms of enterprise ownership.   \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 17 of 28 \n 27. Q. What is the purpo se of a ring -fence in the utility sector?  1 \nA. U tilities typically have legal obligations to operate reliably and maintain their 2 \nsystems for existing customers and to expand their facilities and systems to meet 3 \ncustomer growth.  Thus, some capital expenditures are not discretionary, but are 4 \nrequired so that the utility can fulfill its franchise  obligations and satisfy the 5 \nrequirements of the regulatory authority.  Making such capital investments require s 6 \naccess to funding from internal and, in many cases, external sources.  Thus, it is 7 \nimportant for the utility to retain access to its own resources including its bank 8 \naccounts, accounts receivable, and the ability to draw under its credit arrangements, 9 \neven if its parent or an affiliate is in financial di stress.  If internal sources of cash 10 \nflow are not sufficient, utilities need to access funding from the debt market.  11 \nWithout adequate protection, the utility’s credit -worthiness and access to the debt 12 \nmarket could be impaired if its owner is in financial distre ss, in default , or bankrupt.  13 \nRing- fencing mechanisms have been successfully used to protect utilities from 14 \nrisky parents or affiliated  companies and have proven effective in allowing the 15 \nutilities  to carry out their mandate to serve present and future customers.  16 \n28. Q. Why have the Joint Petitioners  volunteered intercorporate protective  17 \ncommitments as a part of the package of Merger Commitments in this 18 \nproceeding ? 19 \nA.  As discussed in Andrew Gilbert’s Dire ct Testimony, the Joint Petitioners have  20 \nacknowledged the need to make pledges and commitments relative to how they 21 \nconduct their business to provide assurances to the BPU that ETG and SJG will 22 \ncontinue to provide safe, adequate and proper utility service to their customers and 23 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 18 of 28 \n continue to meet their regulatory obligations following the closing of the Proposed 1 \nTransaction.  As I discuss in detail below, the Joint Petitioners’ r ing-fencing 2 \ncommitments will provide a full and robust insulation of ETG and SJG  and their 3 \nimmediate parent SJIU  from the liabilities of the following entities:  SJI, 4 \nBoardwalk, IIF US 2 and all other IIF US 2 -owned companies.   5 \nB. Framework for Evaluating Intercorporate Separation  6 \n29. Q. Is there a coherent framework for evaluat ing the effectiveness of 7 \nintercorporate separation  provisions? 8 \nA. Yes.  Over the years, attorneys and credit rating agencies have amassed experience 9 \nbased upon actual bankruptcies and insolvencies.  Attorneys use the learnings from 10 \nthose precedents  to develop  a set of protective corporate policies and practi ces that 11 \nthey consult when they render non -consolidation opinions.10  Likewise, credit 12 \nrating agencies have used their experiences of corporate defaults to develop lists of 13 \ncorporate policies and practices that they apply to determine if two companies with  14 \ncorporate affiliation must share the same rating, or if the ratings of the two entities 15 \ncan be separated due to protective mechanisms.  I have merged both of those lists 16 \ninto a framework for the systematic evaluat ion of  provisions that protect an 17 \nindividual company within a corporate group.  The list combines and harmonizes 18 \nthe elements that the three major rating agencies employ in their separate guidelines 19 \nto create a master list of standards for evaluat ing the adequacy of intercorporate 20 \n \n10 A non- consolidation opinion by a reputable  legal firm is a reasoned opinion stating that if parents or affiliates of the \nprotected company file for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court would respect the separate legal existence of the protected \ncompany and would not order the substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of the protected company with \nthose of one or more of its parent entities or affiliates.  \n \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 19 of 28 \n separation.  The result is  a list of preferred  ring-fencing practices and policies 1 \nprovided as  Exhibit EL-8.  2 \nThe master checklist is based on the concept that two types of protection 3 \nare needed  to safeguard the viability of a protected entity:  4 \n• Practices that allow the protected company to maintain access to its 5 \nown physical and financial  assets and  sources of funding, despite the 6 \nfinancial distress or bankruptcy of its parent or affiliate; and  7 \n• Practices that eliminate or reduce the risk that the protected 8 \ncompany will be drawn into the bankruptcy of its  parent or affiliate.   9 \nConsequently, the master checklist has two tracks: Track I contains practices that 10 \nallow a company (called “the Protected Company” in Exhibit EL-8) to  preserve its 11 \nown identity, to remain viable, to fund itself and defend its own assets and liabilities 12 \neven if a parent or affiliate is in distress; and Track II in the same exhibit contains 13 \npractices that protect a company from involuntary consolidation w ith its parent or 14 \naffiliate in a bankruptcy proceeding.  There is some redundancy between the entries 15 \nin Track I and Track II , since some practices do double duty, serving to achieve the 16 \nobjectives of both tracks .  17 \n30. Q. What entity  or entities do you consider to be the “protected company” in this 18 \nProposed T ransaction?  19 \nA. Three companies are protected in the P roposed Transaction commitments : ETG, 20 \nSJG, and their direct parent, SJIU.   21 \n31. Q. P lease explain the importance of the elements that make up Track I .  22 \nA. Track I includes mechanisms  that allow a company within an ownership group to 23 \npreserve its independent viability in the event of the financial distress of its parent 24 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 20 of 28 \n or other companies in its group.  Within Track I, there are four types of measures.  1 \nThese are:  2 \nI-A. The Protected Company’s assets are protected from diversion by 3 \nhaving a separate legal identity, separate bank accounts and asset 4 \naccounts, with no commingling of assets.  Fixed assets needed to 5 \ncarry out the business should be in the Protected Company’s own 6 \nname.  Transfers of goods, services, and supplies with other 7 \nmembers of the group should be conducted on an arm’s length basis.   8 \nI-B.  The Protected Company can maintain its own access to funding and 9 \nto sources of liquidity.  The Protected C ompany should have access 10 \nto a liquidity credit arrangement  that is  available for drawing even 11 \ndespite the default of the company’s parent or affiliated companies.   12 \nThe defau lt by a parent or affiliate should not trigger a cross default 13 \nor cross acceleration of the Protected Company’s debt.  I f the 14 \ncompany is an accepted issuer of debt in its own name in the public 15 \nor private debt market, that will enhance access to funding, a nd 16 \nmaintain ing a credit rating also help s to foster  that aim .  17 \nI-C.    The Protected Company is insulated from the liabilities of its parent 18 \nand sister companies.  It does not guarantee the debt or obligations 19 \nof other members of its group, and t he other members of the group 20 \nnever represent to the public or to counterparties that the Protected 21 \nCompany is responsible for the obligations of other group members.  22 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 21 of 28 \n I-D.  The Protected Company protects its viability by limiting its financial  1 \nleverage and preservin g its individual solvency.  2 \n32. Q. Please explain the elements of Track II.  3 \nA.  Track II involves steps to avoid the involuntary consolidation of the Protected 4 \nCompany in the bankruptcy of its parent or an affiliate.  As I have mentioned 5 \nalready, several of t he practices that are important in Track I to maintain the 6 \ncompany’s separate financial viability also do double duty by helping to avoid 7 \ninvoluntary consolidation due to the doctrine of substantive consolidation.   8 \n33. Q. What do you mean by substantive consolidation?  9 \n A.  A solvent company within a corporate group might be vulnerable to substantive 10 \nconsolidation along with its bankrupt parent or affiliate if the resources, assets, and 11 \nliabilities of the companies are so commingled  and poorly documented that it is 12 \ndifficult for the bankruptcy court to untangle them.  Another possible cause for 13 \nsubstantive consolidation is if the companies in the past represented to creditors 14 \nthat the assets or cash flow of one company (now solvent) was availab le to satisfy 15 \nthe debts of the other company  (now bankrupt) .  When the court finds either of 16 \nthose pattern s, then creditors of the bankrupt company would seek as a remedy the 17 \nconsolidation of the solvent company in the bankruptcy proceeding to enhance 18 \nrecovery by the bankrupt entity’s creditors.  Protection against substantive 19 \nconsolidation includes keeping good books and records and maintaining separate 20 \nbooks of account.  Also, the Protected Company should never represent to creditors 21 \nof the parent or affi liates that the Protected Company is responsible for its affiliate’s 22 \nobligations.  Additional elements are listed in Exhibit EL -8.    23 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 22 of 28 \n C. Applying the Ring -Fencing Framework to the Proposed Transaction.  1 \n34. Q. What is the role of SJIU in the proposed s tructure?  2 \nA.   At the present time, SJIU owns the shares of the Utilities and carries out some  3 \noperational functions on behalf of the Utilities, which will not change as a result of 4 \nthe Proposed Transaction.  However, the  Joint Petitioners’  commitments anticipate 5 \nthat in addition to owning the shares of ETG and SJG, SJIU may, with BPU 6 \napproval, borrow for the benefit of ETG and/or SJG and lend to them , and  ETG, 7 \nSJG and SJIU may participate in a regulated company money pool.  This will 8 \nreduce  the appearance of any reliance by ETG and SJG upon SJI as a source of 9 \nliquidity. Also, utilizing SJIU as a financing entity exclusively for the benefit of 10 \nETG and SJG  may provide a more efficient financing structure for  ETG and SJG.    11 \n35. Q. H ow do you apply the framework of corporate separation standards to this 12 \nproceeding?  13 \nA. In the Proposed Transaction, the primary objective of the proposed ring -fence is to 14 \nprotect the viability and solvency of the two operating utilities ETG and SJG, but  15 \nintercorporate separation  measures are included to separate SJIU, the direct parent 16 \nof ETG and SJG, from SJI and any other subsidiaries of SJI, as well as from 17 \nBoardwalk and IIF US 2.   18 \nApplying the framework  of Exhibit EL -8, I analyzed the ring- fencing 19 \ncommitments proposed by the Joint Petitioner s and matched them with the 20 \nstandards that contribute to robust protection.  The results of that analysis are 21 \npresented in the Exhibit EL -9.  Using the framework as a checklist, I found that the 22 \nproposed ring- fencing provisions ful fill all the requirements of the framework  and 23 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 23 of 28 \n will provide a thorough separation of the Utilities and SJIU from any risks of their 1 \naffiliates.   2 \n36. Q. P lease summarize the most important  aspects of the  Joint Petitioners’  3 \nproposed protective commitments.  4 \nA.  Under the Joint Petitioners’ integrated framework of protective commitments,  SJG, 5 \nETG, and SJIU will be separated  from liabilities and risks of SJI and other SJI 6 \nsubsidiaries and from Boardwalk and IIF US 2, with stro ng legal provisions  7 \nincluding:11   8 \n• Separate books and record keeping;  9 \n• No commingled  cash and no intercompany lending (except pursuant 10 \nto a BPU -approved utility -only money pool) ;  11 \n• Debt and credit facilities of ETG, SJG and SJI shall have n o cross 12 \ndefaults , no credit guarantees , and no credit rating triggers with SJI, 13 \nother SJI subsidiaries, Boardwalk, or IIF US 2 and its affiliates; 14 \n• ETG and SJG will maintain liquidity sources in their own names 15 \npermitting access without regard to the credit ratings or default or 16 \nbankruptcy of any parent or affiliates;  17 \n• Upstream dividends from ETG and SJG, as applicable, will be 18 \nblocked so long as the relevant senior unsecured rating of ETG or 19 \nSJG is below an investment grade rating;  20 \n• The SJI Board of Directors will have a  majority  of independent s 21 \n(seven out of ten  directors) ; 22 \n• Boardwalk will obtain a non- consolidation opinion from 23 \nindependent legal counsel within 180 days after the closing.  24 \n \n11 See Joint Petition, Exhibit C,  for the full text of each commitment.  The items below summarize and paraphrase \naspects of the Merger Commitments and are not intended to alter the meaning of the Joint Petitioners’ proposed Merger \nCommitments.  \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 24 of 28 \n 37. Q. What protection is provided by the commitment to receive a non -consolidation 1 \nopinion within 180 days after the closing of the Proposed T ransaction? 2 \nA. A non- consolidation opinion regarding the unlikelihood of a substantive 3 \nconsolidation of SJG or ETG in the bankruptcy of SJI, Boardwalk, IIF US 2 or other 4 \nIIF US 2 affiliates does not in itself provide any protection against bankruptcy or 5 \ninsolvency, but it affirms to the BPU  that an independent legal authority will review 6 \nthe implementation of the intercorporate protections and that the set of protections 7 \nis complete.  Also, it provides  greater comfort to current and prospective lenders 8 \nand rating agencies.   9 \n38. Q. A re there any of the Joint Petitioners’  proposed commitments that you would 10 \nlike to highlight?  11 \nA.  In many merger transactions, there is a concern that the companies will add debt to 12 \nfund the purchase price or will incur excessive leverage.  In this transaction, 13 \nBoardwalk is financing the acquisition of SJI’s common stock with 100% equity.  14 \nAdditionally , no incremental debt will be incurred at SJI or any of SJI’s 15 \nsubsidiar ies, including ETG and SJG.  To that effect, in C ommitmen t No.  23, the 16 \nJoint Petitioners  pledge that SJIU, SJG, and ETG will not incur any incremental 17 \ndebt to fund the Proposed Transaction.  Also, Commitment No. 28 states that SJIU 18 \nwill not incur any debt except to make loans to ETG and/or SJG.  In other words, 19 \nthe consolidated capital struct ure of SJIU along with ETG and SJG  will reflect the 20 \nunderlying capital structure of the Utilities.  This is important because avoiding 21 \nexcessive debt leverage will help to preserve the Utilities’ financial strength and 22 \nresilience.  23 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 25 of 28 \n 39. Q. Why has Boardwalk arranged a bridge financing facility in connection with 1 \nthe Proposed Transaction?  2 \nA. Boardwalk has received a committed bridge financing facility from KeyBanc 3 \nCapital Markets and PNC Capital Markets  as a backstop for certain existing debt, 4 \nincluding SJI ’s, ETG ’s and SJG’s revolving credit facilities .  The bridge facility 5 \nwill not be used to finance the equity purchase price and is exclusively in place in 6 \ncase there is a need to replace any debt or liquidity facilities which include  change- 7 \nof-control provisions that could take effect after the consummation of the Merger , 8 \nas discussed in greater detail in Andrew Gilbert’s Direct Testimony .  The existence 9 \nof the  bridge facility provide s assurance that SJI, ETG and SJG will maintain access 10 \nto liquidity to cover any potential need at the time of closing .  11 \n40. Q. What conclusions do you draw from your evaluation of the ring- fencing plan 12 \nas proposed ? 13 \nA.  Using the systematic framework  to assess the ring-fence and governance 14 \ncommitments proposed by the Joint Petitioner s, I find that the proposed 15 \ncommitments  match up well with  the standards for a robust intercorporate 16 \nseparation , as summarized in Exhibit EL -8.  Therefore, I conclude that  the propos ed 17 \nplan will constitute a  full and robust separation of ETG, SJG, and SJIU  from 18 \nexposure to the risks  of their parents SJI and Boardwalk, and from any liabilities or 19 \nactivities of IIF US 2 and IIF US 2’s other affiliates.  ETG and SJG will  be able to 20 \nmaintain access to sources of funding and each will be able to maintain control of 21 \nits own assets and liquidity despite any potential financial distress of its corporate 22 \nparents or affiliates.  T hese practices will also insulate ETG and SJG  from exposure 23 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 26 of 28 \n to an involuntary bankruptcy (that is, substantive consolidation in the bankruptcy 1 \nof SJI, Boardwalk, or IIF US 2 or any other affiliates of IIF US 2).   2 \n41. Q. Does the supervision of the BPU  enhance the effectiveness of the Joint 3 \nPetitioners’ protective commitments?  4 \nA. Yes.  The BPU ’s regulatory authority and controls in such areas as the U tility’s 5 \ntransactions with affiliates, transfers of utility assets,  and issuance of debt provide 6 \nassurance to creditors and credit rating agencies of the st rength of the  Joint 7 \nPetitioners’  ring-fencing.  8 \n42. Q. D o you expect the proposed protections will have a favorable e ffect upon the 9 \ncredit ratings of ETG and SJG ? 10 \nA.  Yes.  In my opinion, the Joint Petitioner s’ proposed ring- fencing 11 \ncommitments will provide a full and robust insulation of SJIU, ETG and SJG  from 12 \nany liabilities of SJI, other SJI subsidiaries and  from Boardwalk, IIF US 2 , and all 13 \nother IIF US 2 -owned companies .  S&P implemented new guidelines for group 14 \nratings in July 2019 ( Exhibit EL -5, paragrap hs 65-68).  Applying the Joint 15 \nPetitioners’ proposed corporate structure and the integrated suite of ring- fencing 16 \ninsulation, in the context of  these group rating guidelines, S&P may determine the 17 \nrating of ETG and SJG to be at least one notch  above the group credit rating of SJI , 18 \nbut no higher than the Utilities’  standalone credit profile.   19 \nMoody’s currently rates  SJG on an individual  basis at A3, and I do not 20 \nanticipate any increase or reduction in SJG ’s rating from Moody’s as a result of th e 21 \nProposed Transaction.  22 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 27 of 28 \n V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION  1 \n43. Q. What are the conclusions of your D irect T estimony ? 2 \nA. The Proposed T ransaction and  associated commitments in Exhibit C  to the Joint 3 \nPetition  have been designed to ensure that the  Proposed Transaction is beneficial 4 \nto ETG and SJG customers and their communities.   After the closing of the 5 \nProposed Transaction, ETG and SJG  will have at least similar and possibly superior 6 \naccess to common equity funding via Boardwalk and IIF US 2, whenever the 7 \nUtilities  require equity capital in the future.  Furthermore, ETG and SJG will 8 \ncontinue to have  at least comparable and possibly superior access to debt capital 9 \nand to liquidity facilities .  There will be no concerns on the part of investors and 10 \ncredit rating agencies that ETG or SJG will be adversely affected by ownership by 11 \nBoardwalk or IIF US 2, thanks to the full array of protective measures that the Joint 12 \nPetitioner s have proposed in their Joint Petition .  13 \nAfter a careful review the protective measures proposed by the Joint 14 \nPetitioner s and comparing them with a framework for evaluating the effectiveness 15 \nof intercorporate separation, I conclude that these measures will offer excellent and 16 \nrobust insulation.  They will provide strong separation for the Utilities’  customers 17 \nand communities from risks of involuntary consolidation in bankruptcy with SJI, 18 \nBoardwalk , IIF US 2, or any IIF US 2 affiliates .  Also, the proposed ring-fencing 19 \nprovisions will assure that each of ETG and SJG  main tains access to its own 20 \nresources and cash flow so that it can continue to carry out its mandate to serve 21 \ncustomers , even in the case of financial distress of any of its parents or affiliate s.   22 \nTherefore, I recommend that the BPU  approve the Proposed Transaction and adopt 23 \nthe protective measures as proposed by the Joint Petitioner s.  24 \nDOC Exhibit 315\nLapson Direct  \nPage 28 of 28 \n 44. Q. D oes this conclude your Direct Testimony? 1 \nA. Yes, it does. 2 \nDOC Exhibit 315"

What challenges does Minnesota Power face in recruiting and retaining the skilled 6 \nemployees necessary to serve the needs of its customers?  7 \nA. In the past, Minnesota Power’s compensation and benefit program has been effective in 8 \nrecruiting and retaining employees.  However, recruiting and retaining employees with 9 \nspecialized or high demand skills has been difficult , and we anticipate it will become 10 \nincreasingly more so.  Specifically, the Minnesota Department of Employment and 11 \nEconomic Development (“ DEED ”) continues to emphasize that the economic 12 \nenvironment in Northeast Minnesota, which includes Duluth, faces two main 13 \nchallenges:  (1)  a tightening labor market, and (2) an aging population.  Additionally, 14 \nmotivating individuals to move to Northeast Minnesota presents its own challenges as 15 \nthe area as a whole undergoes its own overall redevelopment and significant changes in 16 \nindustry. 17 \n 18 \nQ. Please describe how a tighten ing labor market affects Minnesota Power’s ability 19 \nto attract and retain qualified employees.  20 \nA. A tightening labor market forces Minnesota Power and other Northeast Minnesota 21 \nemployers to compete for a dwindling number of applicants with the necessary ski lls, 22 \nparticularly in the specialty areas of science, technology, engineering, skilled trades, 23 \nand accounting/finance.  Despite higher unemployment rates in Northeast Minnesota as 24 \ncompared to the rest of the state, the number of qualified job seekers per va cancy has 25 \nconsistently declined over recent years.  In addition, based on number of qualified 26 \napplicants applying for positions, Minnesota Power assesses  the number of qualified job 27 \nseekers is low.  Additionally, we are finding that the compensation package we are able 28 \nto offer is, at times, not sufficient to attract qualified applicants, which has been 29 \nhappening more frequently than in prior years.  30 \n 31 \nDOC Exhibit 316\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 8 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-21-335 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules Q. Why is the labor market in Northeast Minnesota area so tight? 1 \nA. Of the six planning regions into which DEED divides the state, Northeast Minnesota is 2 \nthe least populated.  As illustrated in Table 1 , Northeast Minnesota has experienced a 3 \ndecrease in population since 2010, losing 2,687 people, a 0. 8 percent decrease, even 4 \nthough the population of the state of Minnesota as a whole has grown by 353,417 5 \npeople , a 6.7  percent increase.  Approximately 70.5 percent of the Company’s 6 \nemployees work in St. Louis County, which has experienced decreasing population 7 \nsince 2010.  8 \n 9 \nTable 1.  Northeast Minnesota and State of Minnesota Population Change 2010-2020  10 \n 11 \n 12 \nIn addition to the negative growth rate, the Northeast Minnesota region also has an aging 13 \npopulation.  Figure 1 shows that Northeast  Minnesota has a much older population than 14 \nthe state as a whole, with 22.4 percent of residents aged 65 years and over, compared to 15 \n16.8 percent statewide, and a lower per centage of people in the 25 to 64 year -old age 16 \ngroup than the state as a whole. 17 \nDOC Exhibit 316\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 9 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-21-335 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules  1 \nFigure 1.  Age of Northeast Minnesota and State of Minnesota Populations 2 \n 3 \n 4 \nAs a result of the decl ining and aging population , Northeast Minnesota has a tight labor 5 \nmarket .  Prior to the coronavirus crisis, the number of available workers declined and 6 \nthe region’s labor market tightened through the fourth quarter 2019. One clear 7 \ndemonstration of this is the ratio of unemployed jobseekers per vacancy, which in 2019 8 \nstood at 0.9 -to-1 in Northeast Minnesota, meaning that there was less than one job 9 \nseeker per vacancy.  After briefly rising to 2.7 in the second quarter of 2020, the ratio 10 \nsat near one at the end of the year again, indicating a return of tight labor market 11 \nconditions. According to recent job vacancy survey results, there were 7,846 openings 12 \nreported by employers compared to 7,102 unemployed jobsee kers in the region. These 13 \nstatistics are reflected in  Figure 2. 14 \n 15 \nDOC Exhibit 316\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 10 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-21-335 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules Figure 2.  Jobseekers per Vacancy 200 9-2020 – Northeast Minnesota  1 \n 2 \n 3 \nQ. Are there any unique challenges associated with recruiting and retaining 4 \nemployees in Northeast Minnesota as compared to the State as a whole?  5 \nA. Yes.  Northeast Minnesota is a great  location for outdoor enthusiasts to work, play, and 6 \nlive.  However, for those who are not drawn to an outdoor lifestyle or do not have a tie 7 \nto the region, it can be difficult to convince people to make the initial move to this region 8 \nto work.  Convincing an experienced hire to move to Northeast Minnesota can be even 9 \nmore difficult when the hire has a trailing family member who is already working in the 10 \nother market and wants to continue working.  Job applicants may be reluctant to move 11 \nto the region due to the climate, lower wage perceptions, housing concerns, an evolving 12 \nindustry landscape, or the desire to stay in larger cities where there are more 13 \nemployment opportunities and more diverse cultural choices , such as large community 14 \ncenters, places of worship, restaurants, and grocery stores.   15 \n 16 \nDOC Exhibit 316\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 11 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-21-335 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules Q. H ave the remote work opportunities presented over 2020 and 2021 resolved these 1 \nconcerns?  2 \nA. No.  While we have identified and provided remote work opportunities for certain roles , 3 \nthe Company has many roles that cannot be completed entirely remotely.  There fore, 4 \nthese challenges remain as the Company works to maintain a viable workforce. 5 \n 6 \nQ. How does Minnesota Power’s workforce compare to the demographics of 7 \nNortheast Minnesota?  8 \nA. Minnesota Power’s workforce has similarly challenging demographics.  In the 2016 9 \nRate Case, the Company anticipated that 20 percent of its employees would be retiring 10 \nin the next five years, through 2021.  That expectation aligned with what occurred.  The 11 \nCompany now a nticipates that approximately 19  percent of its employees will b e 12 \nretiring in the next five years, through 2026, assuming an average retirement age of 60.  13 \n 14 \nQ. How has Minnesota Power responded to the challenges associated with recruiting 15 \nand retaining employees in Northeast Minnesota?  16 \nA. Minnesota Power is taking several steps  to respond to these challenges.  Because it is 17 \ncurrently difficult to find qualified new employees, the Company is  also focusing its 18 \nattention on retention  of skilled employees . 19 \n 20 \nIn addition to our ongoing efforts to work with local schools and offering internships, 21 \nthe Company has undertaken many initiatives to recruit and retain employees.  First, it 22 \nhas embraced alternative work arrangements and hybrid work.  Alternative work 23 \nschedules and working from remote locations can help employees balance work with 24 \nother commitments, such as families or educational opportunities.  Second, the 25 \nCom pany continues to offer its tuition reimbursement program, which allows 26 \nemployees to obtain additional education so they can grow into new jobs .  Third, the 27 \nCompany is supporting initiatives and group programs that provide opportunities for 28 \nprofessional development, including internal training, engaging with industry and local 29 \npeers, encouraging on -the-job training through engagement on cross -functional and 30 \nproject teams, multiple robotics volunteer teams that aim to connect employees with 31 \nDOC Exhibit 316\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 12 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-21-335 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules young people interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Fourth, 1 \nthe Company has reclassified the pay for some positions and added intermediate pay 2 \nlevels to ensure that employees are paid competitively and consistent with the market 3 \nfor their skills.  Fifth, the Company has thoughtfully designed benefits packages, and 4 \nincentive and bonus plans, to help ensure that skilled employees stay at the Company.   5 \n 6 \nQ.  Has Minnesota Power undertaken any specific initiatives to further broaden its 7 \nreach in attracting talent?  8 \nA. Yes.  The Company continues to partner with the Duluth Workforce Development 9 \nBoard and the Northeastern Minnesota Office of Job Training and their regional 10 \npartners, all of which are devoted to attracting, managing, placing, enriching, and 11 \nretaining the talent community for Northeast Minnesota.  In addition, Minnesota Power 12 \ntook a leadership role, engaging several subject matter experts from w ithin the 13 \nCompany, in the Commission’s  Energy Utility Diversity Stakeholder Group 14 \n(“EUDG”)2.  Minnesota Power has also proactively sought out and participated in 15 \nopportunities, beyond general job boards or career fairs, to collaborate with and learn 16 \nfrom o ther stakeholders in the utility industry to expand the Company’s hiring reach 17 \nand increase diversity in its workforce. 18 \n 19 \nQ. What other steps has the Company taken to address these workforce challenges?  20 \nA. For decades, Minnesota Power has supported veterans, military members, and their 21 \nfamilies in various ways.  In 2016, the Company took an additional step, becoming the 22 \nfirst Duluth -based company to earn Yellow Ribbon Company designation from the State 23 \nof Minnesota.  Minnesota Power is extremely proud of this designation, which 24 \nrecognizes the Company’s ongoing commitment to its military -connected employees, 25 \ntheir families, and the community. 26 \n 27 \n                                                 \n2 EUDG Stakeholder Report Submitted to the Minnesota Legislature on  January 15, 2020 and filed in Docket No. \nE,G- 999/CI -19-336. \nDOC Exhibit 316\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED"

What challenges does Minnesota Power face in recruiting and retaining the skilled 8 \nemployees necessary to  serve the needs of its customers?  9 \nA. R ecruiting and retaining employees with specialized or high demand skills has been 10 \nincreasingly difficult in recent years and economic data strongly suggests this trend will 11 \ncontinue or even worsen . Specifically, the Minnesota Department of Employment and 12 \nEconomic Development (“DEED”) continues to illustrate that the economic 13 \nenvironment in Northeast Minnesota, which includes Duluth, faces two main 14 \nchallenges: (1)  a tightening labor market and (2) an aging population.  15 \n 16 \nQ. Please describe how a tightening labor market affects Minnesota Power’s ability 17 \nto attract and retain qualified employees.  18 \nA. A tightening labor market forces Minnesota Power and other Northeast Minnesota 19 \nemployers to compete for a decreasing  number of qualified applicants, particularly in 20 \nthe specialty areas of science, technology, engineering, skilled trades, and 21 \naccounting/finance. T he number of qualified job seekers per vacancy has consistently 22 \ndeclined over recent years. In addit ion, based on number of qualified applicants 23 \napplying for positions, Minnesota Power assesses the number of qualified job seekers 24 \nis low.  Finally , we have found that the compensation package we are able to offer is, at 25 \ntimes, not sufficient to attract qualified applicants. This has been happening more 26 \nfrequently in recent  years , which is why the Company has made changes to the 27 \ncompensation and benefits package as noted throughout my Direct Testimony. 28 \n 29 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 10 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-23-155 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules Q. Why is the labor market in Northeast Minnesota area so tight? 1 \nA. Of the six planning regions into which DEED divides the state, Northeast Minnesota is 2 \nthe least populated. As illustrated in Table 1 , Northeast Minnesota has experienced a 3 \ndecrease in population since 2010, with a small decrease of  163 people, even though the 4 \npopulation of the state of Minnesota has grown by 413,259 people, a 7.8 percent 5 \nincrease.  Approximately 70 percent of the Company’s employees work in St. Louis 6 \nCounty, which has experienced decreasing population since 2010, by 694 people.  7 \n 8 \nTable 1. Northeast Minnesota and State of Minnesota Population Change 2010-2022  9 \n 10 \n 11 \nIn addition to the negative growth rate, the Northeast Minnesota region also has an aging 12 \npopulation. Figure 1 shows that Northeast Minnesota has a much older population than 13 \nthe state, with 21.1 percent of residents aged 65 years and over, compared to 14 \n15.8 percent statewide, and a lower percentage of people in the 25 - to 54- year-old age 15 \ngroup than the state (33.8 percent  compared to 38.4 percent , respectively ). 16 \n 17 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 11 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-23-155 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules Figure 1. Age of Northeast Minnesota and State of Minnesota Populations  1 \n    Percentage of Population by Age Group, 2022 2 \n 3 \n 4 \nPrior to the pandemic, an increasingly tight labor market and a growing scarcity of 5 \nworkers was recognized as one of Northeast Minnesota’s most significant barriers to 6 \nfuture economic  growth. After some pandemic- induced uncertainty, tight labor market 7 \nconditions returned rapidly. One clear demonstration of this is the ratio of unemployed 8 \njobseekers per vacancy, which in 2019 stood at 1- to-1 in Northeast Minnesota, meaning 9 \nthat there were roughly the same number of people looking for work as there were open 10 \njobs. After briefly rising to 1.9 in 2020, the ratio has since declined to an all -time low 11 \nof 0.5 jobseekers per vacancy  in 2021 and 2022. According to recent job vacancy survey 12 \nresults, there were 12,388 openings (the second highest on record)  reported by 13 \nemployers compared to 5,828 (lowest on record)  unemployed jobseekers in the region. 14 \nThese statistics are reflected in  Figure 2 . 15 \n 16 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 12 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-23-155 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules Figure 2.

Are there any unique challenges associated with recruiting and retaining 5 \nemployees in Northeast Minnesota as compared to the state as a whole? 6 \nA. Yes. Northeast Minnesota is a great  location for outdoor enthusiasts to work, play, and 7 \nlive. However, for tho se who are not drawn to an outdoor lifestyle or do not have a tie 8 \nto the region, it can be difficult to persuade people to make the initial move to this region 9 \nto work.

Job 12 \napplicants may be reluctant to move to the region for a variety of reasons, including the 13 \ndesire to stay in larger cities where there are more employment opportunities ; more 14 \ndiverse cultural choices, such as large community centers, places of worship, 15 \nrestaurants, and grocery stores ; or to live in their desired  location and work remotely 16 \nwhile earning  a higher income  with a more  generous compensation and benefits package 17 \nthan what Minnesota Power is able to offer.  18 \n 19 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 13 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-23-155 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules Q.

No. While we have identified and provided remote work opportunities for certain roles , 2 \nthe Company has many roles that cannot be completed entirely remotely. Therefore, 3 \nthese challenges remain as the Company works to attract, retain , and engage  our 4 \nworkforce. 5 \n 6 \nQ. How does Minnesota Power’s workforce compare to the demographics of 7 \nNortheast Minnesota?  8 \nA. Minnesota Power’s workforce reflects the aging demographic of Northeast Minnesota. 9 \nIn Minnesota Power’s 2021 Rate Case, Docket No. E015/GR-21- 335 (“ 2021 Rate 10 \nCase”) , the Company anticipated that 19 percent of its employees would be retiring in 11 \nthe next five years, through 2026, and is currently on track to meet that forecast . The 12 \nCompany anticipates that trend will continue , with approximately 19 percent of its 13 \nemployees retiring in the next five years, through 2028, assuming an average retirement 14 \nage of 60. 15 \n 16 \nQ. How has Minnesota Power responded to the challenges associated with recruiting 17 \nand retaining employees in Northeast Minnesota?  18 \nA. Minnesota Power continues to take steps  to respond to these challenges . The Company 19 \nhas significantly increased the number of job fairs and community recruiting events it 20 \nattends, both within and outside of the state.  The Company has also increased its focus 21 \non building a robust internship program to feed the talent pipeline  and help secure entry 22 \nlevel talent , especially  in hard to fill positions such as engineering, accounting, and 23 \ncyber technology.  24 \n 25 \nIn addition to responding to challenges for  entry -level positions, the Company is 26 \ndeveloping strategies to hire mid -career employees.  The Company is finding this 27 \ndemographic harder to hire, which underscores the need  to retain and engage our current 28 \nworkforce. In 2023, the average years of service Minnesota Power employees leaving 29 \nthe Company had was 14.8 years.  While the Company has robust internal growth 30 \nopportunities for employees, we need to ensur e the experience level of employees  aligns 31 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED\n \n 14 \n  Docket No. E015/GR-23-155 \n  Krollman Direct and Schedules with the needs of the Company. Because we continue to operate in a tight labor market, 1 \nthe Company is also  focusing its attention on retention of skilled employees. 2 \n 3 \nIn addition to our ongoing efforts to work with local schools and offering interns hips, 4 \nthe Company has undertaken many initiatives to recruit and retain employees.  First, it 5 \nhas embraced alternative work arrangements  and hybrid work. Alternative work 6 \nschedules and working from remote locations can help employees balance work with 7 \nother commitments, such as families or educational opportunities.  Second, the Com pany 8 \ncontinues to offer its tuition reimbursement program, which allows employees to obtain 9 \nadditional education so they can grow into new jobs . Third, the Company support s 10 \ninitiatives and group programs that provide opportunities for professional development , 11 \nincluding internal training, engaging with industry and local peers, encouraging on- the- 12 \njob training through engagement on cross -functional and project teams, and safety 13 \nimprovement teams collaborating as a way to engage employees with safety and well - 14 \nbeing. Fourth, the Company has reclassified the pay for some positions and added 15 \nintermediate pay levels to ensure that employees are paid competitively and consistent 16 \nwith the market for their skills.  Fifth, the Company has thoughtfully designed benefits 17 \npackages and incentive and bonus plans to help ensure that skilled employees stay at 18 \nthe Company.  19 \n 20 \nQ.  Has Minnesota Power undertaken any specific initiatives to further broaden its 21 \nreach in attracting talent?  22 \nA. Yes. The Company continues to partner with the Duluth Workforce Development Board 23 \nand the Northeastern Minnesota Office of Job Training and their regional partners, all 24 \nof which are devoted to attracting, managing, placing, enriching, and retaining the talent 25 \ncommunity for Northeast Minnesota.  In addition, Minnesota Power took a leadership 26 \nrole, engaging several subject matter experts from within the Company, in the 27 \nCommission’s  Energy Utility Diversity Stakeholder Group (“EUDG”)2 to examine the 28 \nchallenges and opportunities for Minnesota’s energy utilities to attract a diverse 29 \n \n2 The EUDG Stakeholder Report was s ubmitted to the Minnesota Legislature on January 15, 2020 and was filed \nin Docket No. E,G -999/CI -19-336. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT -  \nNOT PUBLIC DATA EXCISED"

Skelton 15,962 $67 $1,069,454 \nResponse: (a) The column titled “Number of Shares Beneficially Owned” from ALLETE’s annual proxy statement (SEC\nForm DEF14A) accurately depicts the shares of Common  Stock beneficially owned, as of March 15, 2024,\nby Directors, nominees for Director, executive officers.\nAs noted in the proxy statement, the ALLETE Board believes \nthat Directors and executive officers should\nhave an equity interest in the Company, as such equity ownership aligns the Directors' interests with\nthose of the Company's shareholders. As noted in part (b) below, a vast majority of the sharesrepresented in the Securities Owned by Management were provided as part of ALLETE’scompensation and benefit programs over the course of the individual’s period of employment.Additionally, the table above does not reflect the va lue of individual shares as compared to the $67\npurchase price (e.g., ALLETE’s share price from  March 2017 through March 2020 was well above $67\nper share, and at other times were below that level).\n(b) Using the Total Shares Beneficially Owned for Common Stock Ownership Purposes column of the\nSecurities Owned by Directors and Management from the ALLETE’s annual proxy statement (SEC Form\nDOC Exhibit 319\nWitness: Laura Krollman \nResponse Date:  03/28/2025 \nResponse by: Laura Krollman \nEmail Address: lkrollman@allete.com \nPhone Number: 218-723-7536 Witness: n/a \nResponse Date: n/a \nResponse by: n/a \nEmail Address: n/a \nPhone Number: n/a Witness: n/a \nResponse Date: n/a \nResponse by: n/a \nEmail Address: n/a \nPhone Number: n/a DEF14A) is not an accurate way to calculate the value ALLETE Directors, nominees for Director, executive \nofficers, and all Directors, nominees for Director, and executive officers stand to receive for their shares \nof ALLETE common stock in the event that the Acquisition closes for the reasons noted below.  Additionally, due to the numerous variables that could impact the number of shares and total value, it is not possible to provide a table stating the total expect ed payment each individual identified in Table 2 of \nthis information request is expected  to receive for shares of common stock held in ALLETE once the \nAcquisition closes, as explained below. \nx The Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) in the table reflect the RSU grants and dividends accrued through\nMarch 15, 2024. Since the 2024 filing, the 2022-2024 RSU grant has been paid out, in accordance with\nthe terms of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), and an RSU grant was made in 2025 for the 2025-2027 period.  Additionally, the RSUs earn quarte rly dividends that change the number of shares.\nThe number of RSUs also would change in the event of a retirement, such as Mr. Morris’ announced\nupcoming retirement.  His RSU grants will be prorated to reflect the number of months of service he\nhad during each grant’s three-year period and paid after his retirement date, based on the then\nclosing-stock price.  In the event the merger closes prior to Mr. Mo rris’s RSUs being paid, the shares\nwould be valued at $67/share (the merger consideration value), just like all other shareholders willreceive.\nx The number of shares beneficially owned by execut ives periodically adjusts based on a variety of\nitems, such as dividends, acquisition of ALLETE stock through the Retirement Savings and StockOwnership Plan (“RSOP”) (where a portion of be nefit contributions are made quarterly in ALLETE\nstock) and Performance Share Awards (“PSAs”) granted under the under the Long-Term Incentive\nPlan.  The Preliminary Proxy, filed on June 21, 2024, outlines the treatment of outstanding RSUs andPSAs upon merger.\nxFor the Non-Employee Directors and Nominees for Director, the table reflects the shares as of\nMarch 14, 2024, but since that date, as part of  the Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan,\nthey received their 2024 stock retainer in June 2024 as stock, which they could elect to defer\nunder the Director Deferral Pl an or receive in shares.\nx Margaret A. Thickens retired in 2024 and we are no longer required to track the number of shares\nshe owns.\nWhile it does not impact the value expected upon closing, it is important to note that a vast majority of the \nshares represented in the Securities Owned by Management are part of ALLETE’s market-based \ncompensation and benefit programs (such as the RS OP and the LTIP). A large portion of the shares \nbeneficially owned by the executives represents compen sation earned as stock instead of cash through the \nLTIP, with varying cost basis (the last 5-year range is $53.54 -$85.12; avera ge of $66.50 per share). \nSUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE March 3 ϭ, 2025: \nBy email on the afternoon of March 28, 2025, the Department wrote the following: \nALLETE’s response to Department Information Request No. 115 is nonresponsive. The Department instructed ALLETE to either (1) confirm the total expected payment each individual identified in Table 2 is expected to \nDOC Exhibit 319\nWitness: Laura Krollman \nResponse Date:  03/28/2025 \nResponse by: Laura Krollman \nEmail Address: lkrollman@allete.com \nPhone Number: 218-723-7536 Witness: n/a \nResponse Date: n/a \nResponse by: n/a \nEmail Address: n/a \nPhone Number: n/a Witness: n/a \nResponse Date: n/a \nResponse by: n/a \nEmail Address: n/a \nPhone Number: n/a receive for shares of ALLETE stock once the Acquisition closes; or (2) provide a corrected table with the right \npayout figures. This response does neither of those things.  \nMinnesota Power provides this supplemental response strictly to clarify for the Department that, as stated \nin the March 28, 2025 response, the information requested by the Department cannot be provided.  \nMinnesota Power and the Partners object to this request to the extent that it calls for speculation. Subject to \nand without waiving the foregoing objection, please see the following response:  \n(b) As an initial matter, Minnesota Power disagrees with the Department’s characterization that its March28, 2025 response is “nonresponsive.” Minnesota Power can confirm that Table 2 accurately reflects the\nnumber of the Total Shares Beneficially Owned for Common Stock Ownership Guideline Purposes as of\nMarch 14, 2024 multiplied by the $67.00 per share stoc k price offered by the Partners for the Acquisition.\nHowever, the “correct table stating the total expect[ed] payment each individual identified in Table 2 is\nexpected to receive for shares of common stock held in ALLETE once the Acquisition closes” requested bythe Department in the original response and as further requested on March 28, 2025 to “provide acorrected table with the right payout figures” is not possible for the reasons stated in the March 28, 2025response. As previously stated:\nxDividends will continue to accrue and increase the number of shares.\nxDirectors are set to receive a stock retainer on June 2, 2025. Because such retainer is based on\nshare price at that time (in the future), Minnesota Power is not able to identify how many shares\neach director will receive.\nxMinnesota Power is not able to predict the stock performance at the moment in time the\nAcquisition closes, if the Acquisition is approved. Therefore, Minnesota Power cannot predict thenumber of shares that will be received at closing.\nxThe Restricted Stock Units are prorated as of the date of the closing of the Acquisition and cannotbe predicted at this time.\nTherefore, a table that speculates as to each of these factors is not available to provide an estimate  as the \nDepartment requests. \nDOC Exhibit 319"

    "content": "XCEL ENERGY INC.  \nGUIDELINES ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n(\nAs proposed to be a \nmended \n \nand restated effective \nJuly 3\n0, 2024 \n) \n \nXcel Energy Inc. (“Xcel Energy”) was created to be a premier provider of energy services \nin an increasingly competitive marketplace. To achieve this goal, all parts of Xcel Energy and its \nsubsidiaries and affiliates including the Xcel Energy Board of Direc tors (the “Board”) should \nendeavor to make decisions and create business processes that promote the best interests of \nXcel Energy’s shareholders, customers, employees and communities. To this end, the Board of \nDirectors of Xcel Energy has established the following guidelines to assist it in governing \nXcel Energy and its subsidiaries and affiliates.  \nEXPECTATIONS FOR THE BOARD AND ITS DIRECTORS  \nA. Board Membership Criteria . The Governance, Compensation and Nominating \nCommittee (“Committee”) is responsible for reviewing with the Board, on an annual basis, \nthe appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the \ncurrent make \n- \nup of the Board. This assessment of the perceived needs of the Board and \nthe qualification of Directors should consider factors such as demonstrated leadership; \njudgment; skill; diversity; integrity; experience with business, operations relevant \n \nto the \nenergy industry and working for or with organizations of comparable size. The Committee \nshould also consider the interplay of each Director nominee’s experience with the \nexperience of other Board members and the extent to which a Director nominee w ould be \na desirable addition to the Board and any committees of the Board. \n \nThe Committee is committed to identifying, recruiting and recommending qualified \ncandidates who reflect diverse backgrounds. Factors the Board may consider regarding \ndiversity include, but are not limited to, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, veteran sta tus, \nsexual orientation, race, national origin, color, religion, creed, geographic representation, \neducation and personality. If the Committee is unable to identify, recruit and recommend \ndiverse candidates to the Board, the Committee will engage a third \n-p\narty search firm and \nis committed to including candidates with diverse backgrounds in the pool of candidates.  \nThe Committee will recommend candidates for election to the Board in accordance with \nthe policies and principles in its charter and the criteria described herein. The Board itself \nwill be responsible for recommending members and potential members for election by the \nshareholders. The Board delegates the required screening process to the Committee with \nthe direct input from the Chief Executive Officer. \n \nThe majority membership of the Board shall be Independent Directors as defined by The \nNasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). \n \nB. Director Orientation and Continuing Education . Each new Director is expected to \nparticipate in a detailed orientation process. Each sitting Director is expected to participate \nin a periodic continuing education process. Such orientation or continuing education shall \nbe established and reviewed periodically by the Committee and shall, at a minimum, cover \nthe Xcel Energy business, organizational, technical, financial, legal, regulatory and \ncompetitive challenges and opportunities as well as Xcel Energy’s m aterial financial \ncommitments, risks and credit arrangements. The orientation or continuing education will \ninclude background materials, meetings with Xcel Energy company management and \nvisits to Xcel Energy facilities.  \nMP-48 \nC. Director Expectations. Each member of the Xcel Energy Board of Directors is expected \nto: \n1. Own Xcel Energy common stock or stock equivalents in the amount of seven (7) \ntimes his or her then-current retainer. New members shall have up to five years \nfrom the date of their election to the Board to satisfy this requirement; \n2. Prepare for, attend and participate in all Board meetings and meetings of Board \ncommittees on which he or she serves and devote the time necessary to \nappropriately discharge his or her responsibilities. Each Board member is \nexpected to ensure that other  commitments do not materially interfere with the \nmember’s service as a Director; \n3. A member serving on a total of three or more public company boards, including \nXcel Energy, will seek approval from the Committee prior to joining another board. \nIn addition, in order to avoid a conflict of interest, members will seek approval from \nthe Chai rman of the Board and the Committee before accepting a Directorship with \nanother company that he or she did not hold when most recently elected to the \nBoard; \n4. Submit a letter of resignation for the Board’s consideration upon retirement, a \nchange in employer or a meaningful change in professional responsibilities. The \nBoard may accept or reject such resignation in its discretion after consultation with the Committee and consideration as to whether the noted change in an individual’s \nprofessional responsibility directly or indirectly impacts that person’s ability to fulfill \nhis or her obligations as a Director of Xcel Energy; \n5. Retire from the Board the day of the annual meeting of shareholders after attaining \nthe age of seventy -two (72);  \n6. Except for inside Directors, retire from the Board the day of the annual meeting of \nshareholders after serving fifteen (15) years on the Board; and \n7. In an uncontested election, if a nominee for Director who is an incumbent Director \nis not elected as described in Xcel Energy’s Articles of Incorporation, the \nincumbent Director shall, promptly after certification of the election results, offer to \ntender his or her resignation to the Board. The Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or \nwhether other action should be taken. The Board shall act on whether to accept \nthe Director’s offer, taking into account the recommendation of the Committee, and \npublicly disclose (by press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision \nand the rationale behind it within 90 days after  the date of the certification of the \nelection results. The Committee, in making its recommendation, and the Board, in \nmaking its decision, may each consider any factors or other recommendations that \nit considers relevant and appropriate. The incumbent Dir ector who offers to tender \nhis or her resignation shall not participate in the Board’s decision. If such \nincumbent Director’s offer to tender his or her resignation is not accepted by the \nBoard, such Director shall continue to serve until the next annual m eeting and until \nhis or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier death, resignation, \nretirement, disqualification or removal. Following the acceptance of an incumbent \nDirector’s resignation, or when a position on the Board is not filled because a non-\nincumbent nominee for that position is not elected, the Board, in its sole discretion, \nmay fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the size of the Board in each case \npursuant to the provisions of Xcel Energy’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. \nD. Compensation Policy and Annual Compensation Review . It is the policy of the Board \nto provide Independent Directors with appropriate compensation for their service on the Board. Proposed changes in Board compensation shall initially be reviewed by the \nCommittee, but any changes in the compensation of Direc tors shall require the approval \nof the Board. The Committee shall periodically review the status of Board compensation in relation to other comparable companies and other factors the Committee deems \nappropriate.  \nE. Board Performance Evaluation. The Lead Independent Director will manage the \nevaluation of Board performance. The Directors will annually assess the performance of \nand processes used by the Board. The members of each respective committee will \nconduct an assessment, annually, of the performance of the respective committee. In \naddition, the Lead Independent Director will annually conduct interviews with each individual director as part of the Board evaluation process to solicit additional feedback \nregarding the Board, committees and individual directors.  \nF. Chief Executive Officer Performance Evaluation. The Independent Directors serving \non the Committee are responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive \nOfficer. This evaluation should be conducted annually, and at the discretion of the \nCommittee may include input from the non-Committee member Independent Directors \nserving on the Board. The Chairman of the Committee should communicate evaluation \nresults to the Chief Executive Officer. The evaluation is to be used by the Committee in \ndeter mining the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer. The evaluation should be \nbased on objective criteria to include the performance of the business, accomplishment of \nreported goals and long -term strategic objectives and the development of management. \nG. Board Size. The Board determines the number of Directors as permitted in Xcel  Energy’s \nArticles of Incorporation and Bylaws and will periodically review the size of the Board \nbased on recommendations of the Committee.  \nH. Meetings. The Board intends to meet at least quarterly and will engage with senior \nmanagement for separate strategy sessions from time to time. Each Director is free to suggest agenda items. All Board and committee meetings may be conducted with one or \nmore Directors participating by means of remote communication. \nI. Access to Management and Independent Advisors. Directors shall have full access to \nofficers and employees of Xcel Energy and, as necessary and appropriate, Xcel  Energy’s \nexternal advisors, including legal counsel and independent accountants. Any meetings or \ncontacts that a Director wishes to initiate may be arranged through the Chief Executive \nOfficer or the Corporate Secretary or directly by the Director. The Directors will use their judgment to ensure that any such contact is not disruptive to the busi ness operations of \nXcel Energy and will, to the extent appropriate, provide the Chief Executive Officer with a copy of any written communication between a Director and an officer or employee of, or \nadviser to, Xcel Energy.  \n In addition to the authority granted hereunder or under each committee’s charter, the \nBoard and each committee have the power to hire independent legal, financial or other \nadvisors, as they may deem necessary without consulting or obtaining the approval of \nsenior management. \nJ. Board Independence. The Xcel Energy Board believes that maintaining its independence \nfrom management by adhering to the following policies is important: \n• Independent Directors . A majority of the Directors on the Board will be non-\nemployees who qualify as “independent” under the listing standards of Nasdaq, \nreading such listing standards of Nasdaq as if they contained a four -year “cooling-\noff period” instead of the three-year period currently contained therein \n(“Independent Directors”), and no more than two insider Directors will be on the \nBoard at any time. For a Director to qualify as an Independent Director, the Board must affirmatively determine, taking i nto account all of the relevant facts and \ncircumstances, that such Director has no material relationship with Xcel Energy, \neither directly or indirectly. The Board will review annually the relationship that \neach Director has with Xcel Energy. The basis for  the Board’s determination that \na relationship is not material shall be disclosed in accordance with applicable rules \nand regulations. Independent Directors shall not be employees of any Xcel Energy \nbusiness unit or legal entity. No Director may be an empl oyee or representative of \na significant supplier of any Xcel Energy business unit or legal entity unless \nXcel Energy entered into its relationship with the supplier as a result of competitive \npurchasing practices.  \nK. Lead Independent Director . The Board considers it to be useful and appropriate to \ndesignate an Independent Director to serve in a lead capacity to coordinate the activities \nof the other Independent Directors and to perform such other duties and responsibilities \nas the Board of Dir ectors may determine. The Lead Independent Director coordinates the \nactivities of the other Non-Management Directors, and performs such other duties and \nresponsibilities as the Board may determine. To that end, the Committee wil l be \nresponsible for recommending a Lead Independent Director to the Board for election based on its assessment of the specific needs of the role of Lead Independent Director \nand the relevant circumstances at the time of recommendation. The Independent Dir ectors \nwill elect the Lead Independent Director for a one-year term, unless the role is vacated at another date prior to the expiration of the one-year term. The Lead Independent Director is generally expected to serve for more than one year. \n1. Board Meetings . The Lead Independent Director will preside at all meetings of the \nBoard at which the Chairman is not present or in the event the Board has not \nelected a Chairman, including executive sessions of the Independent Directors.  \n2. Communication. The Lead Independent Director will serve as liaison between the \nChairman and the Independent Directors. The Lead Independent Director will \nmaintain regular communications with other Independent Directors and focus \nDirector communication on critical issues. The Lead Independent Director will \nprovide information on Director concerns and issues to the Chairman. \n3. Agenda and Materials . The Lead Independent Director will approve the agenda for \nthe Board and, with the Chairman, approve all materials provided to the members.  \n4. Meeting Schedules . The Lead Independent Director will approve meeting \nschedules to ensure sufficient time is provided for discussion of agenda items. \n5. Meetings . The Lead Independent Director is authorized to call meetings of the \nIndependent Directors.  \n6. Consultation with Shareholders . Management has primary responsibility for \ncommunicating with shareholders. The Lead Independent Director will be available \nfor consultation and direct communication with major shareholders, if requested.  \n7. Executive Board Sessions . The Independent Directors will meet in Executive \nSession on a regularly scheduled basis, typically before or after scheduled \nmeetings of the Board and at least twice a year. The Lead Independent Director \nwill chair executive sessions. The name of the Lead Independent Director will be published in Xcel Energy’s annual proxy statement. \n8. Chief Executive Officer Succession Planning. The Lead Independent Director in \nconsultation with the Committee will develop and maintain a process for \nChief Executive Officer succession planning.  \nL. Board Committees.  \n1. Required Committees . Consistent with Nasdaq listing requirements, the Board will \nhave at all times an Audit Committee and a Governance, Compensation and \nNominating Committee. All of the members of those committees will be \n“independent” under the criteria established by Nasdaq and under applicable law. \nAll committees shall receive authority exclusively through delegation from the Board through the Bylaws, Board resolutions, committee charters or as provided \nby these guidelines.  \n2. Appointment and Term of Service of Committee Members . The committee \nmembers and committee Chairs will be appointed by the Board, upon \nrecommendation of the Committee, with consideration of the desires of individual \nDirectors. Consideration will be given to rotating committee members and Chairs periodically, but the Board does not believe that rotation should be mandated as a \npolicy.  \n3. Committee Charters . Consistent with Nasdaq listing requirements, each required \ncommittee will have a written charter approved by the Board. The charters will set forth the purposes and responsibilities of the committees as well as qualifications \nfor committee membership, procedures for appointment and removal, structure \nand operations and reporting to the Board. The charters will also provide that each \ncommittee will annually evaluate its performance. Consistent with Nasdaq listing \nrequirements, the charters will be included on Xcel  Energy’s website, and copies \nof the charters will be made available upon request to Xcel  Energy’s Corporate \nSecretary.  \n4. Committee Meetings and Committee Agenda. Each committee chair, in \nconsultation with the committee members and appropriate officers of Xcel  Energy, \nwill determine the frequency of committee meetings consistent with the \ncommittee’s charter, provided that any committee member may call a meeting of \nthe committee on which they are members at any time. Each committee chair, in \nconsultation with the other members of the committee and senior management, \nwill develop the committee’s agenda. \nM. Management Succession.  \n1. Chief Executive Officer Selection. The Board shall select a Chief Executive Officer \nin a manner that is in the best interests of Xcel Energy. \n2. Succession Planning and Management Development. The Committee will, at least \nannually, make a report to the Board on succession planning. Xcel Energy’s \nsuccession plan will include appropriate contingencies in case the Chief Executive \nOfficer retires or is incapacitated. The Board, in consultation with the Committee, will evaluate potential successors to the Chief Executive Officer. The \nLead Independent Director in consultation with the Committee will manage the \nprocess for Chief Executive Officer succes sion. The Chief Executive Officer should \nat all times make available his or her recommendations and evaluations of \npotential successors, along with a review of any development plans recommended \nfor such individuals."

SUMMARY OF MINNESOTA POWER’S PROPOSAL  \n On February 20, 202 4, Minnesota Power (the Company) petitioned the Minnesota Public Utilities \nCommission (Commission) for approval of ALLETE Inc.’s (ALLETE) consolidated 202 4 proposed capital \nstructure (Petition). Minnesota Powe r is seeking approval of:  \n \n• ALLETE’s  proposed capital structure, including an equity ratio of 63.05%;  \n• An equity ratio contingency range of +/ - 15% of its proposed equity ratio (i.e., 53.59 % to \n72.51%); \n• Total consolidated capitalization of $6,5 35 million, including a proposed contingency reserve of \n$597  million ; \n• Approval to issue short -term debt up to 15 % of total capitalization ;  \n• Continuation of the variance of Minn. R. 7825.10 00, subp . 6 (2023) to allow ALLETE to treat \nborrowing under multi -year credit ag reements as short -term debt for approved capital \nstructure purposes ;  \n• Authorization to issue securities, provided ALLETE does not exceed the limits of the approved \nequity ratio, maximum short -term debt ratio, or maximum capitalization for more than 60 days , \nwithout prior Commission approval;   \n \nMinnesota Power requests approval of ALLETE’s estimated consolidated capital structure and \nauthorization to issue securities from the date of issuance of a Commission Order approving the instant \npetition through the latter of ( 1) May 1, 202 5 or (2) the date at which the Commission issues a \nsubsequent capital structure o rder . \n \nII. DEPARTMENT ANALYSIS  \n \nA. ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND  \n \nALLETE’s actual and proposed capital structures include financing associated with  ALLETE ’s lines of \nbusiness other than Minnesota Power’s regulated, jurisdictional operations.  For ratemaking, Minnesota \nPower removes financing attributable to ALLETE’s other operations to derive a regulated  capital structure \nspecific to Minnesota Power.1  ALLETE’s equity ratio is inflated relative to Minnesota Power’s regulated \nequity ratio due to equity -heavy financing arrangements used for certain of ALLETE’s non -regulated \noperations.  For this reason, ALLETE’s capital structure is not reasonable for ratemak ing purposes.  \n \n1 In re Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates in Minn. , MPUC Docket No. E015/GR -23-155, Direct \nTestimony of Joshua D. Taran at 5 (Nov. 1, 2023) (eDocket No. 202311 -200095 -04). \n\nDocket No. E015/S -24-108 \nAnalyst  assigned:   Craig Addonizio  \nPage 2 \n \n \n \n However, because Minnesota Power is an operating division of ALLETE, not a separate subsidiary, ALLETE is a public utility under Minn. Stat. § 216B.02, subd. 4 (2023) and any debt or equity issued to finance Minnesota Power’s operations will  be issued by ALLETE.  ALLETE’s capital structure and securities \nissuances are therefore subject to the Commission’s authority per Minn. Stat. § 216B.49 (2023).  \n Generally, Minnesota Power’s rates and utility practices are designed to insulate the Company’s ratepayers from any effects of ALLETE’s non -jurisdictional activities as much as possible.  Therefore, \nthe Department is primarily interested in Minnesota Power’s regulated capital structure, rather than \nALLETE’s overall capital structure .  In reviewing ALLETE’s capital structure as proposed in the Petition, \nthe Department’s intentions are to ensure that Minnesota Power’s jurisdictional capital structure is reaso nable and  allow ALLETE the flexibility to finance its non -regulated operations as it sees fit subject \nto the constraint that the Company’s ratepayers  cannot be unreasonably harmed by those operations .  \n \nB. FILING  AND REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  \n Minn. R. 7825.1300 and 7825.1400 (2023) and prior Commission Orders set forth a number of reporting \nrequirements utilities must adhere to for the issuance of securities.   The Department reviewed Minnesota \nPower ’s Petition and concludes the Company ’s Petition  meets all applicable  requirements . \n C. REASONABLENESS OF PROPOSED CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CONTINGENCY RANGES  \n1. Summary of ALLETE’s Recent and Proposed Capital Structures  \n ALLETE’s actual consolidated capital structures for the past three years, and its projected capital structure for June 30, 2025 are presented below:  \nTable 1: Actual and Projected Consolidated Capital Structures  \n($ Millions)\n2 \n \n Relative to its actual year -end 2023 capital structure, ALLETE’s projected June 30, 2025 capital \nstructure reflects increases of $403 million in net long -term debt and $337 million in additional equity, \nprimarily the result of new equity issuances, rather than retained earnings.  \n \n2 Petition  at 4.

General Discussion of Capital Structure Theory  \n The mix of debt and equity a co mpany uses to finance its operations impacts the cost of its debt and \nequity.  Generally, interest payments on debt are tax deductible, and therefore , all else equal,  the use \nof debt financing creates tax savings , which lowers costs for ratepayers.  Howeve r, the use of debt \n(leverage)  also creates fixed payment obligations ( i.e., interest and principal payments), for which a \nfailure to pay could trigger a costly bankruptcy.  Debt and equity investors are aware of the risks associated with high levels of debt, and as a result, require higher expected returns on their investments as leverage increases.   \n A company must appropriately balance these two competing factors (tax savings and increased costs due to higher financial risk) in determining its capital st ructure.  Starting from a low level of debt,  the \ntax savings generated by increasing the amount of debt in a company’s capital structure often more than offsets the increase in the cost of debt and equity resulting from increased financial risk.   Past a \ncertain point, however, the increase in the costs of debt and equity will outweigh the additional tax \nsavings.  \n Theoretically, every company has a n optimal capital structure that balances these two effects and \nminimizes the company’s cost of capital, after  accounting for taxes .  Figure 1 illustrates this \nrelationship.  As shown, both debt equity costs increase with leverage, but “Total Capital Cost” (the weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect tax savings associated with debt) decreases as debt increases up to 50%, and then begins to rise as the effects of financial risk begin to outweigh the tax savings associated with increased leverage.   \n \n \n3 Attachment 1.  \nDocket No. E015/S -24-108 \nAnalyst  assigned:   Craig Addonizio  \nPage 4 \n \n \n \n Figure 1  \nRelationship Between Capital Structure and the Cost of Capital4 \n \n \nWhile an optimal capital structure theoretically  exists for each company, as a practical matter, it is \ndifficult, if not impossible, to analytically determine what that capital structure is with any precision.  Because of this, historically, the Department has typically assessed the reasonableness of ut ilities’ \ncapital structures by simply comparing them to the capital structures of other utilities of comparable \nrisk.    \nThat simple comparison test, however, is a somewhat blunt tool.  T he range of capital structures used \nby other utilities is often so wi de that it provides little insight into the reasonableness of a particular \ncapital structure.  In addition, there is often disagreement between the Department and the utilities \nabout how to apply the test.  Specifically, the Department generally compares a utility’s proposed \ncapital structure only to publicly traded companies that are primarily comprised of utility operations.  The utilities, however, often compare their proposed capital structure to the capital structures of  other  \nutility operating subsidi aries, which are not publicly traded.  As the Department has discussed in recent \nrate cases, the utilities ’ comparisons create a problematic mismatch between (a) the proxy companies \nused to assess a utility’s proposed capital structure ( i.e., utility operating subsidiaries) and (b) the proxy \ncompanies used to estimate a utility’s cost of equity ( i.e., publicly traded parent or holding companies).\n5  \n \n4 Morin, Roger A., New Regulatory Finance at 454 (2006).  Note t hat this figure is just for illustrative purposes and is not \nnecessarily drawn to a reasonable scale.  \n5 See, for example, in re Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates in Minn. , MPUC Docket No. \nE015/GR -23-155, Direct Testimony of Cra ig Addonizio at 112 (Mar. 18, 2024) (eDocket No. 20243 -204451- 01). \n\nDocket No. E015/S -24-108 \nAnalyst  assigned:   Craig Addonizio  \nPage 5 \n \n \n \n In short, publicly traded parent companies often have higher debt ratios than their utility operating subsidi aries, which implies that they also likely have higher costs of equity.  \n \nHowever, i n the absence of a better, more precise method of assessing capital structure , the Department \nused the comparison test to assess Minnesota Power ’s proposed capital structure , as discussed in greater \ndetail below.  \n \n3. Proposed Capital Structure  \n \nAs noted above, ALLETE ’s proposed capital structure includes an equity ratio of 63.05%, and Minnesota \nPower’s regulated  capital structure includes an equity ratio of 53.00%.   The Company’ s Petition \nincluded no support or analysis demonstrating that either ALLETE’s  proposed capital structure  or \nMinnesota Power’s projected regulated capital structure  is reasonable, or that a higher or lower equity \nratio would not result in a lower long -run w eighted average cost of capital (including tax effects).  \n \nThe Department compared the Company’s proposed capital structure to the actual capital structures of other, risk -comparable electric utilities.  32 publicly traded companies classified by Value Line  as \nelectric utilities have S&P credit ratings between A-  and BBB- , two notches above and one notch below \nMinnesota Power’s credit rating of BBB.  At the end of 2023, the equity ratios of those 32 companies range from 27. 88% to 62. 17% and averaged 41.0 6%.\n6   The Department notes while Minnesota Power ’s \nproposed regulated equity ratio is within the range of other electric utilities’, it is significantly above \naverage.  Of the 32 electric utilities in the Department’s comparison group, only two have a commo n \nequity ratio higher than the Company’s jurisdictional equity ratio.  The Department also discussed these concerns in testimony in Minnesota Power’s most recent rate case.\n7   \n \nHowever, w hile Minnesota Power ’s capital structure may raise some concerns tha t the Company’s \nequity ratio is higher than optimal, it does not raise concerns about an equity ratio that is too low, potentially having negative effects on the Company between rate cases, the primary concern for annual capital structure dockets.   For this reason, the Department concludes that ALLETE’s  proposed \ncapital structure is reasonable and recommends that the Commission approve it.  \n \n4. Reasonableness of Proposed Contingency Ranges  \n \na. Equity Ratio Contingency Range  \n \nMinnesota Power requested a n equity ratio contingency range of +/ - 15% around its proposed equity \nratio for ALLETE of 63.05%, or 53. 39% to 72.51%.   The Company  also requested the ability to exceed \nthe approved range for up to 60 days without prior Commissi on approval.  \n Historically, the Commission has authorized Minnesota Power  to use a 1 5% range around the common-\nequity midpoint and a 60 -day grace period, including the 2023 capital structure currently in effect.  Given \n \n6 Attachment 2.  \n7 In re Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates in Minn. , MPUC Docket No. E015/GR -23-155, Direct \nTestimony of Craig Addonizio at 111 (Mar. 18, 2024) (eDocket No. 20243 -204451 -01). \nDocket No. E015/S -24-108 \nAnalyst  assigned:   Craig Addonizio  \nPage 6 \n \n \n \n this history and the lack of adverse outcomes in recent years, the Department believes this practice has worked well enough to allow the Company sufficient financing flexibility, to keep the Company on sound financial footing, and to maintain needed oversight for the Commission.  The Department therefore concludes continued adoption of this practice is reasonable.  \n \nBased on the above, the Department concludes that Minnesota Power ’s proposed equity ratio \ncontingency range of 53.39% to 72.51%  is reasonable and recommends that the Commission approve it.  \n \nb. Short -Term Debt Ratio  Contingency Range  \n \nMinnesota Power  requested permission to issue up to 15% of ALLETE’s total capitalization as short -\nterm debt.  In recent years, the Commission has approved the 15% cap on ALLETE ’s short -term debt.  \nSimilar to the equity ratio contingency range, the Department concludes that this practice has worked well enough to provide the Company  adequate short -term financial flexibility without adding undue \nrisk to ratepayers.  Therefore, the Department recommends the Commission approve Minnesota Power ’s request to issue short -term debt up to 15% of the Company’s total capitalization.  \n \nc. Maximum Total Capitalization  \nMinnesota Power  requested a maximum capitalization of $ 6,535  million , including a contingency of \n$597 million, or approximately 10% of its expected capitalization.8  Exhibit L of the Company’s Petition \nsummarizes Minnesota Po wer’s planned capital expenditures by functional area, and shows that the \nCompany is planning significant investments in all areas (generation, transmission, and distribution ).  \nThe 10% contingency for total capitalization is consistent with past practice,  and the Department \nconcludes that this practice has worked sufficiently well to balance financial flexibility for the utility with adequate oversight for the Commission.  Therefore, the Department recommends that the Commission \napprove Minnesota Power ’s proposed maximum total capitalization.  \n \nD. REQUEST FOR VARIANCE OF MINN . R. 7825.1000, SUBP. 6 (2023)  \n \nMinnesota Power requested  the Commission grant a continuation of the variance to Minn . R. 7825.1000 , \nsubp. 6 (2023) to allow the Company to treat direct borrowing under a multi -year credit agreement as \nshort -term debt.9  Because the rule defines short- term securities as those with a date of maturity of no \nmore than one year, to classify multi -year credit agreements as short -term debt, Minnesota Power needs \nthe Commission to approve the requested variance.  To vary its rules, the Commission must determine, \nper Minn. R. 7829.3200, subp. 1 (2023), the variance s atisfies three requirements:   \n \nA. Enforcement of the rule would impose an excessive burden upon the applicant or others \naffected by the rule;  \nB. Granting the variance would not adversely affect the public interest; and  \nC. Granting the variance would not conflict with standards imposed by law.  \n \n \n8 Petition  at 1. \n9 Petition  at 6. \nDocket No. E015/S -24-108 \nAnalyst  assigned:   Craig Addonizio  \nPage 7 \n \n \n \n The Department agrees that the Company’s requested variance satisfies the three requirements.  Minnesota Power’s current multi -year credit agreement resembles traditional short -term debt \ninstruments.  Classifying mu lti-year credit agreements as long -term debt could cause credit -rating \nagencies to react unfavorably, thus imposing an excessive burden on the Company and hurting ratepayers.  In addition, classifying multi- year credit agreements as short -term debt would not conflict \nwith any standards imposed by law.  Therefore, the Department recommends the Commission continue to vary Minn. R. 7825.1000, subp. 6 (2023) and  allow Minnesota Power to treat borrowing \nunder multi -year agreements as short -term debt for approved  capital structure purposes.  \n \nE. PENDING ACQUISITION OF ALLETE  \n \nOn May 6, 2024, ALLETE announced that it had entered into an agreement to be acquired by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP Investments”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) .  On t he \nsame day, ALLETE filed a Form 8 -K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that included \nthe Agreement and Plan of Merger  (Merger Agreement)  ALLETE entered into with CPP Investments \nand GIP.\n10 \n The Agreement and Plan of Merger contains language  which requires ALLETE (and Minnesota Power) \nto receive the written consent of CPP Investments and GIP prior to undertaking  certain business \nactivities  while the acquis ition is pending .  Notably, Section 5.01(b)  of the Merger Agreement places \ncertain restr ictions on the Company’s ability to issue debt and equity and make or commit to make \ncapital expenditures  in excess of a capital expenditure budget the Company provided privately to the \nCPP Investments and GIP . \n The Department asked Minnesota Power in an i nformation request whether the acquisition and \nMerger Agreement have any impact on the Company’s financing and capital expenditure plans as described in the Petition.  In its response, the Company did not affirmatively state that its projected capital stru cture as of June 30, 2025 is still applicable but  did state that it expected to remain in \ncompliance with the equity ratio contingency range proposed in the Petition, which “allows a \nreasonable variance threshold for unexpected or unknown events at the tim e of filing the Petition.”\n11  \nMinnesota Power also provided the non -public capital expenditure budget referenced in the Merger \nAgreement, which the Department concludes is reasonably comparable to the budget provided in Exhibit L of the Petition.  Thus, the Department has no concerns  related to the Company’s capital \nexpenditure plans in the near -term.  \n While the Department has some minor concerns that the base capital structure projection included in the Petition is no longer applicable, the Department agrees that changes to that proj ection resulting \nfrom the acquisition can reasonably be dealt in Docket E015/PA -24-198, in which the Commission will \nreview the proposed acquisition.  \n  \n \n10 The Form 8 -K is available on the Investor Relations page of ALLETE’s website and the SEC’s websi te. \n11 Attachment 3. \nDocket No. E015/S -24-108 \nAnalyst  assigned:   Craig Addonizio  \nPage 8 \n \n \n \n III. CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  \n The Department concludes Minnesota Power’s Petition is reasonable and r ecommends the \nCommission take the following action:  \n \n1. Approve Minnesota Power’s Petition which includes the following:  \n• ALLETE’s proposed capital structure, including an equity ratio of 63.05%;  \n• An equity ratio contingency range of +/ - 15% of its proposed equity ratio (i.e., 53.59% to \n72.51%);  \n• Total consolidated capitalization of $6,535 million, including a proposed contingency \nreserve of $597 million;  \n• Approval to issue short -term debt up to 15% of total capitalization;  \n• Continuation of the varianc e of Minn. R. 7825.1000, subp. 6 (2023) to allow ALLETE to treat \nborrowing under multi -year credit agreements as short -term debt for approved capital \nstructure purposes;  \n• Authorization to issue securities, provided ALLETE does not exceed the limits of the \napproved equity ratio, maximum short -term debt ratio, or maximum capitalization for more \nthan 60 days, without prior Commission approval; and  \n• Approval of ALLETE’s estimated consolidated capital structure and authorization to issue \nsecurities from the date of issuance of a Commission Order approving the instant petition \nthrough the latter of (1) May 1, 2025 or (2) the date at which the Commission issues a \nsubsequent capital structure order.  \n2. Require Minnesota Power to file its next request for approval of its  securities issuance no later \nthan March 1, 2025.  \n3. Require Minnesota Power to keep the Commission informed in a timely manner of any important developments in its pending acquisition and any rating agency actions.  \n4. Clarify the Order in this proceeding does not predetermine the Commission’s decision in any future rate case the Company files.  \n \nMinnesota Department of Commerce  \n85 7th Place East │ Suite 280 │ St. Paul, MN  55101  \nInformation Request  \nDocket Number:  E015/S-24- 108 ☐Nonpublic   ☒Public\nRequested From:  Minnesota Power Date of Request:  4/24/2024\nType of Inquiry:   Financial Response Due:     5/6/2024\nSEND RESPONSE VIA EMAIL TO:  Utility.Discovery@state.mn.us  as well as the assigned analyst(s).  \nAssigned Analyst(s) :  Craig Addonizio  \nEmail Address(es):  craig.addonizio@state.mn.us \nPhone Number(s): 651-539-1818  \nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:  \nEach response must be submitted as a text searchable PDF , unless otherwise directed.

The Company expects to remain in compliance with the capital structure petition as currently filed.\nThe Company’s requested 15% equity ratio contingency allows a reasonable variance threshold for\nunexpected or unknown events at the time of filing the Petition.\nb\n. Section 5.01 of the “Agreement and Plan of Merger” defines what actions by the Company require\nconsent from the counterparties to the agreement during the interim time period between signing\nthe agreement and closing.   As a result, the agreement does not inhibit the ability of the Company\nto issue debt or equity, but instead defines what can and cannot be done without the consent of\nthe counterparties to the agreement.  This adds an additional layer of governance to the\nCompany's contemplated debt and equity issuances concurrent with the ALLETE Board of Directors\napproval. Additionally, the merger agreement states the Company will use commercially\nreasonable efforts to maintain its capital structure as authorized by the Minnesota Public Utilities\nCommission and will remain in compliance with the petition as filed.\nc\n. In the same manner described in response to part B, the “Agreement and Plan of Merger” does\nnot inhibit the Company making capital expenditures as filed in the capital structure petition.\nCertain levels of capital expenditures above what is listed in the \"Company Disclosure Letter” (see\npart D below) require consent of the counterparties in a similar manner as to how ALLETE currently\nrequires ALLETE Board approval for such expenditures.\nd\n.

INTRODUCTION  \nOn May 1, 2024, Otter Tail Power Company (OTP, Otter Tail, or the Company) filed a petition (Petition) \nrequesting the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (Commission) approve it s 2024 capital structure.  \nSpecifically, OTP requested approval of:  \n \n• A common equity ratio of 47.2% to 57.7% - derived from a midpoint o f 52.4% plus or minus \n10% of the midpoint (+ or –  5.24 percentage points);  \n• A maximum capitalization of $2.183 billion derived from a base of $1.984 billion plus a 10% contingency of $0.199 billion;  \n• A continuation of the variance to Minn . R. 7825.1000, subp. 6 (2023) , to allow OTP to treat \nborrowings under the multi -year credit agreements as short -term debt for its approved capital \nstructure purposes;  \n• A request to issue short- term debt up to 15% of OTP’s total capitalization not to exceed $25 0 \nmillion;  and \n• A request to issue securities, providing OTP does not exceed the approved equity ratio, \nmaximum short -term debt ratio, or maximum capitalization for more than 60 days.  \n \nOn August 29, 2023, the Commission issued an Order approving OTP’s most recent capital structure \nPetition, in Docket No. E017/S -23-185. In its Order, the Commission:\n  \n \n1. Approved Otter Tail’s 2023 proposed capital structure.  \n2. Approved Otter Tail’s 2023 proposed equity contingency plus/minus 10% around its proposed equity ratio.  \n3. Approved Otter Tail’s request to issue short -term debt up to 15% of capitalization.  \n4. Approved Otter Tail’s total maximum capitalization of $1.958 billion, which includes a base \ncapitalization of $1.780 billion and a contingency of $0.178 billion.  \n5. Allowed Ott er Tail to issue any securities while the Commission’s Order is in effect that would not \nresult in an equity or short -term debt ratio outside the proposed range or a total capitalization \nexceeding its proposed cap for more than 60 days.  \n6. Continued to vary Minn. R. 7825.1000, subp. 6 (2023), to allow Otter Tail to treat borrowings \nunder its multi -year credit agreement as short -term debt for capital structure purposes.  \n7. Allowed the approvals to remain in effect until the Commission issues its next capital stru cture Order.  \n8. Required Otter Tail to file its next request for approval of its 2024 securities issuances no later \nthan May 1, 2024.  \n9. Clarified that the Order in this proceeding does not predetermine the Commission’s decision in \nany future rate case the Compa ny files.  \n \n\nDocket No. E017/S -24-182 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Justin Taylor and Craig Addonizio  \nPage 2 \n \n \n \n II. DEPARTMENT ANALYSIS  \nA. BACKGROUND  \nOTP is a Minnesota c orporation with about 63,000 retail electricity customers in Minnesota.1  OTP is a \nwholly owned subsidiary of Otter Tail Corporation, a holding company that also owns manufacturing \nand industrial -products operating companies.  As a wholly owned subsidiary, OTP has its own capital \nstructure and issues its own debt but does not is sue equity securities and instead receives equity \ncontributions from Otter Tail Corporation.  OTP currently maintains a long -term issuer credit rating of \nBBB+ from Standard & Poor’s (S&P), two levels above the investment -grade minimum of BBB -.  \n \nTo issue securities, OTP needs approval under Minn.  Stat. § 216B.49 (2023)  and approval of its capital \nstructure per Minn.  R. 7825.1100 (2023) .  OTP submitted a petition requesting both authorizations to \nissue securities and approval of its 2023 capital structure.  The Company’s 2023 capital structure is \neffective until the Commission issues its Order regarding OTP’s 2024 capital structure.  \n \nB. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  \nMinn.  R. 7825.1300 and 7825.1400 (2023) and prior Commission Orders set forth a number of \nreporting requirements utilities must adhere to for the issuance of securities.   The Department \nreviewed OTP’s Petition and concludes the Company meets all applicable  requirements . \n C. REASONABLENESS OF OTP’S PROPOSED CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CONTINGENCY RANGES  \n1. Summary of OTP’s Recent and Proposed Capital Structures  \nOTP’s actual capital structure for 2020 through 2023 and the Company’s  projected 2024 capital \nstructure are shown in Table 1 below : \n \nTable 1: OTP’s Recent Actual and Proposed Capital Structures\n2 \n($000s)  \n \n \n1 OTP also has some  municipal customers and about 70,000 customers in the Dakotas.  \n2 2024 Proposed and 2023 Actual taken from Petition, Attachment 1; 2021 and 2022 Actuals taken from E017/S -23-185 Actual Actual Actual Projected\nDec. 31, 2021 Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2023 Dec. 31, 2024\n($000s) (%) ($000s) (%) ($000s) (%) ($000s) (%)\nShort-term Debt 65,526      4.1% 8,204         0.5% 81,422      4.5% 77,164      3.9%\nCurrent Maturities of\n    Long-term Debt30,000      -             -             -             \nLong-term Debt 657,000    747,000    747,000    867,000    \nTotal Long-term Debt 687,000    43.3% 747,000    44.9% 747,000    41.4% 867,000    43.7%\nCommon Equity 832,689    52.5% 909,431    54.6% 975,379    54.1% 1,039,819 52.4%\nTotal Capitalization 1,585,215 100.0% 1,664,635 100.0% 1,803,801 100.0% 1,983,983 100.0%\nDocket No. E017/S -24-182 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Justin Taylor and Craig Addonizio  \nPage 3 \n \n \n \n 2. General Discussion  of Capital Structure Theory  \nThe mix of debt and equity a company uses to finance its operations impacts the cost of its debt and \nequity.  Generally, interest payments on debt are tax deductible, and therefore , all else equal,  the use \nof debt financing creates tax savings , which lowers costs for ratepayers.  However, the use of debt \n(leverage)  also creates fixed payment obligations ( i.e., interest and principal payments), for which a \nfailure to pay could trigger a costly bankruptcy.  Debt and equity investors are aware of the risks \nassociated with high levels of debt, and as a result, require higher expected returns on their investments as leverage increases.   \n \nA company must appropriately balance these two competing factors (tax savings and increased costs due to higher financial risk) in determining its capital structure.  Starting from a low level of debt, the \ntax savings generated by increasing the amount of debt in a company’s capital structure often more \nthan offsets the increase in the cost of debt and equity resulting from increased financial risk. Past a certain point, however, the increase in the costs of debt and equity will outweigh the additional tax savings.  \n \nTheoretically, every company has a n optimal capital structure that balances these two effects and \nminimizes the company’s cost of capital, after accounting for taxes .  Figure 1 illustrates this \nrelationship.  As shown, both debt equity costs increase with leverage, but “Total Capital Cost” (the weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect tax savings associated with debt) decreases as debt \nincreases up to 50%, and then begins to rise as the effects of financial ri sk begin to outweigh the tax \nsavings associated with increased leverage.   \nFigure 1  \nRelationship Between Capital Structure and the Cost of Capital\n3 \n \n \nComments.  \n3 Morin, Roger A., New Regulatory Finance at 454 (2006).  Note that this figure is just for illustrative purposes and is no t \nnecessarily drawn to a reasonable scale.  \n\nDocket No. E017/S -24-182 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Justin Taylor and Craig Addonizio  \nPage 4 \n \n \n \n  \nWhile an optimal capital structure theoretically  exists for each company, as a practical matter, it is \ndifficult, if not impossible, to analytically determine what that capital structure is with any precision.  \nBecause of this, historically, the Department has  typically  assessed the reasonableness of utilities’ capital \nstructures by simply comparing them to the capital structures of other utilities of comparable risk.   \n \nThat simple comparison  test, however, is  a somewhat blunt too l.  The range of capital structures used \nby other utilities is often so wide that it provides little insight into the reasonableness of a particular capital structure.  In addition, there is often disagreement between the Department and the utilities about how to apply the test.  Specifically, the Department generally compares a utility’s proposed capital structure only t o publicly traded companies that are primarily comprised of utility operations.  \nThe utilities, however, often compare their proposed capital structure to the capital structures of  other  \nutility operating subsidiaries, which are not publicly traded.  As th e Department has discussed in recent \nrate cases, the utilities ’ comparisons create a problematic mismatch between (a) the proxy companies \nused to assess a utility’s proposed capital structure ( i.e., utility operating subsidiaries) and (b) the proxy \ncompanies used to estimate a utility’s cost of equity ( i.e., publicly traded parent or holding \ncompanies).\n4  In short, publicly traded parent companies often have higher debt ratios than their utility \noperating subsidiaries, which implies that they also likely h ave higher costs of equity.  \n However, i n the absence of a better, more precise method of assessing capital structure , the \nDepartment used the comparison test to assess OTP’s proposed capital structure, as discussed in greater detail below.  \n \n3. Reasonableness of OTP’s Proposed Capital Structure  \nIn its Petition, OTP requested approval of a 52.4% common equity ratio and an equity ratio contingency range of 47.2% to 57.7%.\n5  The contingency range equates to plus/minus 5.24% (or 10% of \nOTP’s common equity ratio).  OTP also requested the ability to exceed the approved range for up to 60 \ndays without prior Commission approval.  OTP’s proposed equity ratio and contingency range are \nslightly lower than the Company’s currently -approved parameters of 53.7% and contingenc y range of \n48.3% - 59.1%.6 \n \nOTP’s Petition included no support or analysis demonstrating that its proposed capital structure is reasonable , or that a higher or lower e quity ratio would not result in a lower long -run weighted \naverage cost of capital (including tax effects).  In its response to Department Information Request No. 1, the Company stated that “periodically assesses this issue in the broader context of minimizing overall cost of capital while maintaining reasonable equity ratios to support our credit ratings and \nattract capital” but was unable to identify or provide any related analyses it has conducted from the \n \n4 See, for example, in  re Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates in Minn. , MPUC Docket No. \nE015/GR -23-155, Direct Testimony of Craig Addonizio at 112 (Mar.  18, 2024 ) (eDocket No. 20243 -204451- 01). \n5 Petition, Cover Letter . \n6 The Commission approved OTP’s current capital structure in Docket No. E017/S- 23-185 on August 29, 2023.  \nDocket No. E017/S -24-182 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Justin Taylor and Craig Addonizio  \nPage 5 \n \n \n \n last five years.7  The Company also discussed its attempts to minimize its cost of debt, but as discussed \nabove, minimizing the cost of debt does not equate to minimizing the after -tax weighted average cost \nof capital.  \n \nThe Department compared the Company’s proposed capita l structure to the actual capital structures \nof other, risk -comparable electric utilities.  32 publicly traded companies classified by Value Line as \nelectric utilities have S&P credit ratings between A and BBB -, two notches above and below OTP’s \ncredit rat ing of BBB+.  At the end of 2023, the equity ratios of those 32 companies range from 27.9% to \n62.2% and  averaged 41.0%.8   The Department notes while OTP’s proposed equity ratio is within the  \nrange  of other electric utilities’ , it is significantly above average.  Of the 32  electric utilities in the \nDepartment’s comparison group, only two have a common equity ratio higher than OTP’s proposed \nequity ratio .  While OTP’s capital structure may raise some concerns that the Company’s equity ratio is \nhigher than o ptimal, it does not raise concerns about an equity ratio that is too low, potentially having \nnegative effects on the Company between rate cases, the primary concern for annual capital structure dockets.   For this reason, the Department concludes that OTP’s  proposed capital structure is \nreasonable and recommends that the Commission approve it.  \n \n4. Reasonableness of OTP’s Proposed Contingency Ranges  \na. Equity Ratio Contingency Range  \nHistorically, the Commission has authorized OTP to use a 10% range around the commo n-equity \nmidpoint and a 60 -day grace period, including the 2023 capital structure currently in effect.  Given this \nhistory and the lack of adverse outcomes in recent years, the Department believes this practice has worked well enough to allow the Company s ufficient financing flexibility, to keep the Company on \nsound financial footing, and to maintain needed oversight for the Commission.  The Department therefore concludes continued adoption of this practice is reasonable.  \n Based on the above, the Department  concludes that OTP’s proposed equity ratio contingency range of \n47.2% to 57.7% is  reasonable and recommends that the Commission approve it . \n \nb. Short -Term Debt Ratio  Contingency Range  \nOTP requested permission to issue up to 15% of the Company’s total capital ization as short -term debt.  \nIn recent years, the Commission has approved the 15% cap on OTP’s short -term debt.  Similar to the \nequity ratio contingency range, the Department concludes that this practice has worked well enough \nto provide OTP adequate short- term financial flexibility without adding undue risk to ratepayers.  \nTherefore, the Department recommends the Commission approve OTP’s request to issue 15% of the \nCompany’s total capitalization.  \n \n \n7 Attachment 1.  \n8 Attachment  2. \nDocket No. E017/S -24-182 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Justin Taylor and Craig Addonizio  \nPage 6 \n \n \n \n c. Maximum Total Capitalization  \nOTP requested a maximum capitalization of $2.182 billion derived from a base of $1.984 billion plus a \n10% contingency of $0.198 billion.9  The requested maximum is 11.44% higher than the $1.958 billion \napproved in OTP’s 2023 capital structure Petition.10  According to Otter Tail, the additional \ncapitalization is required to fund the company’s projected capital expenditures, which relate pri marily \nto its planned transmission, solar and wind investments.11  The 10% contingency for total capitalization \nis consistent with past practice, and the Department concludes that this practice has worked \nsufficiently well to balance financial flexibility for the utility with adequate oversight for the \nCommission.  Therefore, the Department recommends that the Commission approve OTP’s proposed maximum total capitalization.  \n \nD. VARIANCE OF MINN . R. 7825.1000, SUBP.  6 (2023)  \nOTP requested the Commission continue  to vary Minn . R. 7825.1000, subp . 6 (2023) , to allow OTP to \ntreat borrowing under its multi -year credit agreement as short -term debt for approved capital \nstructure purposes.  Because Minn.  R. 7825.1000, subp . 6 (2023) , defines short -term securities as tho se \nwith a date of maturity of no more than one year, to classify multi -year credit agreements as short -\nterm debt, OTP needs the Commission to approve the requested variance.  To vary its rules, the \nCommission must determine, per Minn.  R. 7829.3200, subp . 1 (2023) , the variance satisfies three \nrequirements:   \n \nA. Enforcement of the rule would impose an excessive burden upon the applicant or others affected by the rule;  \nB. Granting the variance would not adversely affect the public interest; and  \nC. Granting the variance would not conflict with standards imposed by law.  \n The Department agrees with OTP that the Company’s requested variance satisfies the three requirements.  OTP’s current multi -year credit agreement resembles traditional short -term debt \ninstruments.   Classifying multi -year credit agreements as long -term debt could cause credit -rating \nagencies to react unfavorably, thus imposing an excessive burden on OTP and hurting ratepayers.  In \naddition, classifying multi- year credit agreements as short -term debt  would not conflict with any \nstandards imposed by law.  Therefore, the Department recommends the Commission continue to vary \nMinn.  R. 7825.1000, subp . 6 (2023) , and allow OTP to treat borrowing under multi- year agreements as \nshort -term debt for approved ca pital structure purposes.  \n \nE. OTP’S SECURITY ISSUANCE  \nOTP requested the Commission allow the Company to issue debt securities and receive equity contributions from Otter Tail Corporation, as long as the Company stays within the approved capital structure.    \n \n9 Petition, Page 2.  \n10 Petition, Page 2; Petition Attachment 3 . \n11 Petition, Attachment 10B.  \nDocket No. E017/S -24-182 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Justin Taylor and Craig Addonizio  \nPage 7 \n \n \n \n Minn. Stat.  § 216B.49, subd . 3 (2023) , states a securities issuance by a public utility may be authorized \nby the Commission individually, or as one of multiple possible issuances approved in the course of a \nperiodic capital structure proceeding.  In OTP’s Petition, the Company requested authorization to issue \nseveral types of securities including long -term debt, inter -company notes, short- term debt.  OTP’s \ncommon equity is received from its parent company.    \n \nPursuant to Minn. Stat. § 216B.49, subd . 4, no public utility may issue a security without a prior finding \nby the Commission that 1) the amount of securities of each class bears a reasonable proportion to each \nother and to the value of the property considering the nature of the business of the public utility, its credit and prospects, the possibility  that the value of  the property may chang e, the effect which the \nissuance  will have on the utility’s management and operations , and any other matter the Commission \ndeems relevant ; and 2) the issuance is reasonable and proper, in the public interest, and will not be \ndetrimental to affected consume rs.   \n Based on the analysis above, the Department concludes that any securities issuances  the Company \nmakes that result in a capital structure with debt and equity ratios within the contingency ranges \ndescribed above  will satisfy the requirem ent that amounts of each class of securities bear a reasonable \nproportion to e ach other.  Consistent with the Commission’s May 12, 2009 Order in Docket No. \nE,G999/CI -08-1416, the Company included in its Petition a general projection of its capital needs  for its \nordinary operat ions.  The total capitalization limit proposed in the Petition is reasonably consistent \nwith the projected need, and therefore the Department concludes that securities issuances that result in a capital structure within the total capitalization lim it are reasonably likely to not be detrimental to \nratepayers.  Fu rther, any rate increases stemming from expenditures funded with new securities \nissuances will be su bject to a prudence review in a future rate proceeding.   \n The Department does not take a position in this filing as to whether OTP’s request complies with additional requirements of law, including Minnesota Statutes Chapter 80A. Therefore, the Department recommends the Commission approve OTP’s request to issue se curities within the parameters of the \napproved capital structure , as well as other applicable securities laws . \n \nIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  \nThe Department concludes OTP’s proposed capital structure Petition is reasonable and recommends the Commission t ake the following action:  \n \n1. Approve Otter Tail Power Company’s 2024 proposed capital structure;  \n2. Approve Otter Tail Power Company’s proposed equity contingency of plus/minus 10% around its 2024 common equity ratio;  \n3. Approve Otter Tail Power Company’s request to issue short- term debt up to 15% of \ncapitalization;  \n4. Approve Otter Tail Power Company’s total maximum capitalization of $2.183 billion which includes a base capitalization of $1.984 billion and a contingency of $0.19 8 billion;  \nDocket No. E017/S -24-182 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Justin Taylor and Craig Addonizio  \nPage 8 \n \n \n \n 5. Allow Otter Tail Pow er Company to issue securities while the Order is in effect that would not \nresult in an equity or short -term debt ratio falling outside the proposed contingency range s or a \ntotal capitalization exceeding its cap for more than 60 days ; \n6. Continue to vary Minn.  R. 7825.1000, subp . 6 (2023)  to allow Otter Tail Power Company to treat \nborrowings under its multi -year credit agreement as short -term debt for capital structure \npurposes ; \n7. Allow the approvals to remain in effect until the Commission issues Otter Tail Pow er Company’s \nnext capital structure Order ; \n8. Require Otter Tail Power Company to file its next request for approval of its securities issuance \nno later than May 1, 2025 ; and \n9. Clarify the Order in this proceeding does not predetermine the Commission’s decision  in any \nfuture rate case the Company files.  \nRe\nsponse to Information Request MN-DOC -00\n1 \nPage\n 1 of 2 \nOT\nTER TAIL POWER COMPANY  \nDoc\nket No : E017 -S-24-1\n82  \nR\nesponse to : MN D\nepartment of Commerce    \nAna\nlyst:  C\nraig Addonizio  \nDa\nte Received:  Ma\ny 23, 2024  \nDa\nte Due:  Jun\ne 03, 2024  \nDa\nte of Response: Jun\ne 03, 2024  \nR\nesponding W\nitness: C\nary Stephenson, Assoc\niate General Counsel, 218 -73\n9-8956  \n______________________________________________________________________________  \nI\nnformatio n R\nequest : \nTopic\n: Proposed Capital Structure \nR\neference(s): n/a  \nRe\nquest: \na\n. Please explain specifically how the Company determined that its proposed capital structure\n(52.7\n% equity ratio) was the best capital structure to propose, rather than a capital structure with\nmore\n or less equity, and provide any supporting analysis the Company has used to determine its\npropo\nsed capital structure.\nb.\nDoes the Company consider the objective of minimizing its current market after -tax w\neighted\na\nverage cost of capital in determining its target/proposed capital structure?

If no, please explain why not.\nAttac\nhments : 1 \nAttac\nhment 1 to IR MN -DOC -001.pdf  \nR\nesponse : \nA.Otter\n Tail Power’s (OTP) capital struc\nture, including its equity ratio, has a significant\ne\nffect on its financial strength. The equity ratio is an important credit metric for rating\na\ngencies in determining OTP’s credit ratings. OTP’s capital structure also assists OTP in\nfina\nncing its investments and operations at a reasonable cost and ensures OTP’s ability to\na\nccess capital markets in a variety of economic conditions. OTP’s capital structure has\nc\nontributed to OTP’s ability to simultaneously finance its significant capital expenditures,\nmaintain it\ns ratings from Moody’s and obtain an upgrade of its ratings from S&P and\nF\nitch, and reduce its cost of LTD. Finally, the expectation is OTP’s capital structure and\ne\nquity ratio also will facilitate OTP’s completion of its future capital expenditure plan.\nAll t\nhese factors benefit OTP customers.\nDocket No. E017/S-24-182 \nDepartment Attachment 1 \nPage 1 of 3\nResponse to Information Request MN-DOC -001 \nPage 2 of 2 \nGiven the scope of OTP’s capital expenditure plan, OTP has determined it is prudent to \nstrengthen its balance sheet to support its investment plans and help maintain strong \nsenior unsecured credit ratings. Thus, OTP’s equity ratio has increased over time through \na mixture of retained earnings and equity infusions from Otter Tail Corporation. OTP’s \nequity ratio is projected to remain at 2024 levels.  \nOTP must be able to access capital at a reasonable cost to finance both investments and \noperations. Further, this access must occur in a variety of economic conditions. Recent \nevents, including the COVID -19 pandemic, Winter Storms Uri and Elliott, and bank \nfailures in 2023 all severely impacted different aspects of the financial system. \nAdditionally, different structural changes like sustained higher energy prices, greater \nsales volatility, supply chain challenges and inflation affect the conditions under which \nOTP is able to access the financial markets. By strengthening OTP’s balance sheet, the \ncompany is able to better meet those changes and continue to maintain access to capital at \nreasonable costs.  \nAttachment 1 to MN -DOC -001 is a copy of Schedule 15 Ann E. Bulkley submitted with \ndirect testimony on November 2, 2023 in Otter Tail Power’s rate case in North Dakota. In \nthat attachment, Ms. Bulkley calculated the average proportion of common equity, long -\nterm debt, preferred equity and short -term debt for the most recent eight quarters for each \nof the companies in the proxy group at the operating subsidiary level. The average \ncommon equity ratio for the operating subsidiaries of the proxy group companies was \n52.06 percent (within a range from 45.30 percent to 60.41 percent). Given that OTP’s \nproposed equity ratio (13 -month average) of 53.50 percent is well within the range of \nequity ratios for the utility operating subsidiaries of the proxy group companies, Otter \nTail Power considers its proposed equity ratio to be reasonable.  \nB.As noted above, the company considers minimizing the cost of capital and the\nstrengthening of the balance sheet is a way to keep the long and short -term debt borrow\ncosts down by maintaining ratings with Moody’s and S&P and Fitch which assist in\nlower borrowing costs on debt issuances. Additionally, OTP works with lenders to\nachieve the lowest interest rates possible when issuing debt to provide the lowest cost of\nborrowing which ultimately helps minimize the weighted average cost of capital.\nOTP issues LTD securities in private placements to institutional investors. OTP has not \nissued public LTD.  To help keep interest rates low, OTP’s LTD offerings have been \nthrough private placements with institutional investors because the amounts placed by \nOTP at any single time are too small for an economic public issuance.  \nRegarding the question of whether the Company considers the objective of minimizing its \ncurrent market after -tax weighted average cost of capital in determining its \ntarget/proposed capital structure and what analysis the Company may have done in this \nregard; the Company periodically assesses this issue in the broader context of minimizing \noverall cost of capital while maintaining reasonable equity ratios to support our credit \nratings and attract capital.     We have not identified any written analysis responsive to the \nspecific point of this Information Request.   \nDocket No. E017/S-24-182 \nDepartment Attachment 1 \nPage 2 of 3\nCase No. PU-23-____ \nExhibit___(AEB-1), Schedule 15  \nPage 1 of 1\nMost Recent 8 Quarters (2021Q3 - 2023Q2)\nCommon Long-Term Preferred Short-Term\nEquity Debt Equity Debt Total\nProxy Group Company Ticker Ratio Ratio Ratio Ratio Capitalization\nALLETE, Inc.

Specifically, the  \nCompany is seeking:  \n \n• Total capitalization of $ 20.0  billion, including a contingency of $7 71 million;  \n• A consolidated equity ratio of 52. 40 percent with a contingency range of ±10 percent (i.e., a \nrange of 47. 16 percent to 5 7.64  percent);  \n• The ability to issue short- term debt not to exceed 15 percent of total capitalization;  \n• Continuation of the variance permitting it to enter into and use multi -year credit  agreements \nand issue associated notes, and to consider any direct borrowings as short -term  debt for \napproved capital structure purposes;  \n• Flexibility to issue securities provided that the Company remains within the contingency  ranges \nor does not exceed them for more than 60 days without Commission  authorization;  \n• Continued flexibility to issue long -term debt, provided the Company remains within the  limits \napproved for the short -term debt and equity ratios, as well as within the total capitalization \nlimit;  \n• Flexibility to use risk management instruments that qualify for hedge accounting  treatment;  \n• Approval to have discretion to enter into financings to replace outstanding long -term  debt \ninstruments with less expensive securities after considering the debt issuance  expenses and \namortization of redemption premiums and expenses, and to enter into  tax-exempt financings if \nfunds are available for construction programs; and,  \n• Approval of the 202 5 capital structure by February 1, 202 5, effective until the  Commission \nissues a 202 6 capital structure Order.  \n \nTable 1 summarizes Xcel Energy’s actual capital structure as of June 30, 202 4, its proposed capital  \nstructure on December 31, 202 5, and the differences between the two.  \n  \n\nDocket No. E002/ S-24-368 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Craig Addonizio and Justin Taylor  \n \n \n \n \n2 Table 1  \nXcel Energy’s Actual and Proposed Capital Structure1 \n($ millions)  \n \n \nActual          Proposed  \n   June  30, 2024     December  31, 2025      Difference       \n($ Millions)    (%)     ($ Millions)    (%)     ($ Millions)    (%)  \n \nCommon  Equity                   8,855    52.5%     10,069    52.4%      1,214     -0.1% \nShort -Term  Debt                 -         0.0%      198    1.0%      198    1.0% \nBorrowings Under  5-Year  Credit  Facility      -           0.0%       -         0.0%      -         0.0%    \nTotal  Short -Term  Debt           -         0.0%      198    1.0%      198    1.0% \nLong- Term  Debt   8,020    47.5%     8,962   46.6 %      942    -0.9% \nTotal  Capitalization     16,875    100.0%      19,229   100.0%      2,354    0.0%   \nContingency   771    4.0% \nTotal Capitalization with Contingency    20,000 \n \n \n \nAs shown, the Company’s proposal reflects an increase in total capitalization of $2. 4 billion, or  \napproximately 1 4 percent, over the 18 months ending December 31, 202 5, and small changes in its  \nequity and debt ratios. Attachment N to the Company’s Petition summarizes the planned uses for this  \nnew capital, with the most significant investments being made in new electric  distribution and \ntransmission assets, and new wind and solar facilities . \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND   \n  \nOctober  31, 202 4 Northern States Power Company, doing business as Xcel Energy,  filed a \npetition requesting approval of its 2025 Capital Structure.  \n  \nIII. DEPARTMENT ANALYSIS  \nA. REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  \nMinnesota Rules 7825.1000 – 7825.1500 and several prior Commission orders establish a number of  \nreporting requirements relevant to Xcel Energy’s capital structure filings. In addition, the Commission  \nhas imposed in various orders other ongoing requirements with which the Company must comply, such  \nas restrictions on its use of the Utility Money Pool. Department Attachment 1 lists the various  \nrequirements. The Department has reviewed the Company’s Petition and concludes that the Company  \nhas complied with all relevant requirements.  \n \n \n1 Petition, Attachment B.  \nDocket No. E002/ S-24-368 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Craig Addonizio and Justin Taylor  \n \n \n \n \n3 B. XCEL ENERGY’S PROPOSED CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND REQUEST FOR \nFLEXIBILITY TO ISSUE SECURITIES TO APPROVED CONTINGENCY RANGES  \nB.1. Applicable Statutes  \n Minnesota Statues section 216B.49, subdivision 3 states:  \nIt is unlawful for any public utility organized under the laws of this  state to  \noffer or sell any security … unless the security issuance of the public utility  \nis first approved by the commission, either as an individual issuance or as one of multiple possible issuances approved in the course of a periodic  \nproceeding reviewing the utility's proposed sources and uses of capital  \nfunds. Approval by the commission must be by formal written order.  \n \nFurther, Minnesota Statutes section 216B.49, subdivision 4 states, in part:  \nIf the commission shall find that the proposed security issuance is  \nreasonable and proper and in the public interest and will not be  \ndetrimental to the interests of the consumers and patrons affected  \nthereby, the commission shall by written order grant its permission for the  \nproposed public financing.  \n \nB.2. Reasonableness of Xcel Energy’s Proposed Capital Structure  \n \nFinance theory suggests a number of factors that a company might weigh in determining its target \ncapital structure. The most important, arguably, is that because interest payments on debt are tax  \ndeductible, the use of debt in a company’s capital structure creates net cost savings via lower taxes.  \nHowever, debt also creates binding financial obligations in the form of required interest and principal \npayments, which increase the risk of financial distress and potentially bankruptcy. As a company’s  debt \nload grows, investors will be aware of this risk, and past a certain point, the returns both debt and \nequity investors require to compensate for this risk will begin to increase such that they more than offset the tax savings generated from the additional debt. Companies must weigh these competing  \npressures to find a capital structure that strikes a reasonable balance between debt and equity.  \n While finance theory suggests that each firm has an optimal capital structure that minimizes its  after -\ntax weighted average cost of capital, it does not offer a clear method of determining what that optimal \ncapital structure is. As a result, assessing the reasonableness of Xcel Energy’s proposed capital structure is difficult. Xcel Energy’s Petition did not include any analysis or discussion demonstrating  \nthat its proposed capital structure is optimal, or at least cannot easily be improved upon.  \n \nDocket No. E002/ S-24-368 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Craig Addonizio and Justin Taylor  \n \n \n \n \n4 One simple method of assessing the Company’s proposed capital structure is to compare it to the  \ncapital structure of other utilities. As shown in Department Attachment 2, the equity ratios of  \ncompanies classified as electric utilities by the investment research firm Value Line range from 2 7.9 \npercent to 6 1.4 percent. Xcel Energy’s proposed equity ratio is within this range, providing some  \nsupport for the Company’s proposed capital structure. However, the wide range of equity ratios among  \nelectric utilities does not allow for strong assurance that Xcel Energy’s proposed capital structure is \nreasonable. And even given the wide range, Xcel Energy’s proposed equity ratio  of 52. 4 percent is well \nabove average (4 1.2 percent), and higher than that of all but three  of the 3 5 utilities listed , which may \nindicate the Company’s equity ratio is higher than optimal.  \n \nThe Department also notes that Xcel Energy, Inc.’s capital structure contains notably more debt than \nthose of its utility subsidiaries, including Northern States Power Minnesota . \n \nTable 2 \nComparison of Xcel Energy, Inc. ’s and Subsidiaries ’ \n2023 Capital Structure s2 \n($million s) \n \n \nIt is not clear why it is reasonable for Xcel Energy, Inc.’s to be financed with so much more debt than its utility subsidiaries.  \n \nHowever, f or now, the Department notes  that Xcel Energy’s proposed capital structure is consistent \nwith its past practice, and appears to be  reasonable based on a comparison to the capital structures of \nother utilities, which is the standard the  Department has applied historically.  \n  \n \n2 S&P Capital IQ Pro  CompanyShort-\nTerm\nDebtLong-\nTerm\nDebtTotal \nCommon \nEquityTotal \nCapitalShort-Term \nDebt RatioLong-Term \nDebt RatioCommon \nEquity \nRatio Total\nNorthern States Power Company - MN 165    7,330     8,207     15,702   1.05% 46.68% 52.27% 100.00%\nNorthern States Power Company - WI 60      1,211     1,366     2,637     2.28% 45.92% 51.80% 100.00%\nPublic Service Company of Colorado 371    7,450     9,742     17,563   2.11% 42.42% 55.47% 100.00%\nSouthwestern Public Service Company 102    3,311     3,986     7,399     1.38% 44.75% 53.87% 100.00%\nSubtotal - Operating Subsidiaries 698    19,302   23,301   43,301   1.61% 44.58% 53.81% 100.00%\nXcel Energy Inc. 785    25,482   17,616   43,883   1.79% 58.07% 40.14% 100.00%\nDifference - Subs vs. Xcel Energy, Inc. 87      6,180     (5,685)    582         0.18% 13.49% -13.67%\nDocket No. E002/ S-24-368 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Craig Addonizio and Justin Taylor  \n \n \n \n \n5 B.3. Reasonableness of Proposed Contingencies and Flexibility to Issue Securities \nSubject to those Contingencies  \n \nAs noted above, Xcel Energy proposed the following contingencies related to its capital structure:  \n \n• an equity ratio contingency range of 47. 16 percent to 57.64 percent, or 10  \npercent below and above its proposed equity ratio of 52. 40 percent  \n• a cap on short -term debt of 15 percent of total capitalization; and  \n• a contingency of $7 71 million, or 4. 0 percent for its total capitalization.  \n \nThe proposed contingency ranges for the Company’s equity ratio, short- term debt ratio, and total  \ncapitalization are consistent with long -standing practices and appear to successfully be serving the  \npurpose of providing the Company with adequate short- term flexibility without subjecting ratepayers  \nto undue risk. For that reason, the Department concludes that Xcel Energy’s proposals are reasonable.  \n \nThe Department notes that while Xcel Energy did not request a specific long -term debt contingency  \nrange, that contingency would effectively be set by the Company’s other proposals. At the minimum  \nallowable equity and short- term debt ratios under Company’s proposal (47. 16 percent and zero,  \nrespectively), the Company’s long -term debt ratio would be 52. 5 percent. If the Company were to \nreach both that maximum long -term debt ratio and its proposed maximum total capitalization ($ 20.0  \nbillion), its long -term debt balance would be $ 10.5  billion. This amount is notably higher than its \ncurrent and projected total debt balances of $ 8.0 and $ 9.0 billion, respectively, and the associated \nincrease in the Company’s required interest and, eventually, principal payments , would result in \nincreased financial risk.  \n \nHowever, the Department understands that Xcel Energy’s goal is to maintain a capital structure \nrelatively close to its proposed capital structure (with a 52. 4 percent equity ratio), and the \ncontingencies are  intended to allow the Company flexibility to handle unforeseen financing needs. If \nthe Company’s capital structure were to deviate from the proposed capital structure significantly, the \nDepartment expects that the Company would work to return to its prefe rred capital structure, and the \nCommission would continue to have oversight over the Company’s capital structure.  \n Based on the above discussion, the Department concludes that the Company’s proposed contingencies  \nare reasonable, and recommends that the Commission approve them. Similarly, the Department  \nrecommends that the Commission approve the Company’s request for approval to issue securities  \nprovided that the Company stays within the proposed contingency ranges or does not exceed them for  \nmore than 60 days without Commission authorization.  \n  \nDocket No. E002/ S-24-368 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Craig Addonizio and Justin Taylor  \n \n \n \n \n6 C. CONTINUANCE OF THE VARIANCE FOR THE MULTI -YEAR CREDIT \nAGREEMENT  \nXcel Energy requested a continuing variance from Minn. R. 7825.1000, subp. 6, for authority to treat \ndirect borrowings under its multi -year credit facility (MYCF) as short -term debt. The Rule defines  short -\nterm debt as debt with a maturity of no more than one year from the date of issuance. Because  the \nMYCF is a multi- year agreement, the Company needs the Commission to vary Minn. R. 7825.1000,  \nsubp. 6 in order to treat borrowings as debt with a maturity of less than one year.  \n \nPer Minn. R. 7829.3200, the Commission can only grant a variance if the following three requirements  \nare met:  \n \n1. enforcement of the rule would impose an excessive burden upon the applicant  \nor others affected by the rule;  \n2. granting the variance would not adversely affect the public interest; and  \n3. granting the variance would not conflict with standards imposed by law.  \n The Department agrees with the Company that these requirements are satisfied. While the MYCF is a  \nmulti -year agreement, borrowing s under the MYCF are intended to be short- term and therefore  \nresemble the type of short- term debt governed by Minn. R. 7825.1000. Credit ratings agencies may  \nreact unfavorably if borrowings under the MYCF were classified as long -term debt, thus imposing an \nexcessive burden on the Company and potentially its ratepayers. Classifying the MYCF as short -term  \ndebt would not adversely affect the public interest, and the Department is not aware of any standards  \nimposed by law with which granting the variance would conflict. Therefore, the Department  \nrecommends that the Commission grant the requested variance.  \nD. PERMISSION TO USE RISK -MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS  \nXcel Energy requested continued permission to use risk -management instruments that qualify for \nhedge accounting treatment under Accounting Standards Codification No. 815 (e.g., U.S. Treasury locks and interest rate swaps) in compliance with the policies of  the Company’s parent, Xcel Energy, Inc., and \nwith required officer approvals. The Company also stated that it would report on the use of any such \ninstruments in its next annual capital structure filing.  \n \nIn this Petition, the Company reported that in response to interest rate volatility leading up to its \nFebruary 2024  debt issuance, it entered into a  number of 30 -year forward treasury contract rate locks \nto hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates and provide some certainty regarding the \nproceeds of the issuance. The Company stated  that its hedges resulted in a roughly $ 8.5 million gain \nthat it will reflect in its cost of debt.\n3 \n \n3 Petition, Attachment I -2 at 146.  \nDocket No. E002/ S-24-368 \nAnalyst(s) assigned: Craig Addonizio and Justin Taylor  \n \n \n \n \n7 The Department generally agrees that the risk -management instruments Xcel Energy requests \nflexibility to use can benefit ratepayers as long as the Company follows prudent corporate guidelines.  \nThe Company’s use of these instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates in advance of its \nMay 2023 issuance also appears to have been reasonable. Further, the Commission will have continued \noversight over the Company’s use of these instruments. T herefore, the Department recommends that \nthe Commission approve the Company’s request.  \nE. PERMISSION TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN OTHER FINANCINGS  \nXcel Energy requested permission to have discretion to enter into financings to replace outstanding long -term debt instruments with less expens ive securities after considering all relevant costs, and to \nenter into tax -exempt financings if funds are available for construction programs. As both types of \ntypes of financings could reduce costs to ratepayers, the Department recommends that the \nCommissio n approve the Company’s request. The Department also requests that the Company report \non any such financings in  its next capital structure filing.  \nIV. DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS  \nWhile the Department has some concerns about the lack of analysis in the record regarding alternative  \ncapital structures with more or less debt, based on its review, and for the reasons discussed above, the \nDepartment concludes that Xcel Energy’s requests in this proceeding are reasonable. Therefore, the \nDepartment recommends that the Commission approve Xc el Energy’s Petition  for approval of the \nCompany’s 2025 Capital Structure . \n \n \n \n1 \n  \nAttachment s  \n  \n \n  \n \n \nSource  Requirement  \n2003 -01-13 Order in  \nE,G002/S-02- 1907 More specific explanations of the purpose for the security issuances than the  \nexplanation that funds will  be used for \"general corporate purposes.\"  \nAddress the appropriate cost of capital to apply to filings for the next 12 months.  \nXcel must file capital structure petitions annually.  \nXcel can make inter -company loans to Xcel Energy, Inc.  \nXcel may encumber no utility property in Minnesota for purposes other than operating \nthe utility and may use no Minnesota property for non -utility purposes.  \n2004 -07-09 Order in \nE,G002/AI -04-100 Xcel must not use the Utility Money Pool if it can borrow directly from a bank or other \nfinancial institution at a lower rate.  \nXcel can lend to the Utility Money Pool only if the returns on investment are equal to \nor greater than returns Xcel could have received elsewhere.  \n2009 -05-12 Order in  \nE,G999/CI -08-1416 An exhibit providing a general projection of capital needs, projected expenditures, \nanticipated sources,  and anticipated timing, with the understanding that such exhibit is \nnot intended to require  dollar -fo\nr-do\nllar on the uses identified in the exhibit or to limit \nissuances to project -spe\ncific financing.

Lee  \nRegulatory and Legislative Affairs, Manger \nMinnesota Energy Resources \nCorporation\n \n2665 145th Street West, Box 455  \nRosemount, MN  55063 \n- \n0455\n \n \nThe Department has modified the recommendations provided in its Comments dated April \n20, 2015.  The Department continues to recommend  approval of  the petition with \nconditions and is available to answer any questions the Commission may have.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n/s/ JOHN KUNDERT  \nFinancial Analyst  \n \nJK/ja \nAttachment  \nMP-53 \n \n \n \n \nBEFORE THE MINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION  \n \nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTS OF THE  \nMINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE  \nDIVISION OF ENERGY RESOURCES  \n \nDOCKET NO. G011/PA -14-664 \n \n \n \nI. INTRODUCTION  \n The Minnesota Department of Commerce (Department) respectfully submits these \nSupplemental Comments in response  to the comments submitted by the Office of the \nAttorney General Anti -Trust and Utilities Division (OAG -AUD) on April 20 , 2015 and the reply \ncomments submitted by Minnesota Energy Resources Corporation (MERC or Applicant) on  \nApril 27, 2015.   \n In its comments filed on April 20, 2015, the Department recommended that the \nCommission add the following  three conditions  to the list of 30 proposed conditions the \nDepartment included in Attachment B to its April 20, 2015 filing : \n \n1. The Commission will deny  MERC recovery of increased financing costs due to any \nrating agency downgrades in any subsequent general rate proceeding for the first three years following the merger.  \n \n2. Any increased capital costs determined by the Commission to be related to \ndowngrading  or other credit degradation of the holding company and/or non -\nutility affiliates should be removed from the cost of capital for MERC.  \n \n3. Costs allocated or assigned from IBS, or its successor,  cannot increase above the \nlevel approved in MERC’s most recent g eneral rate case (Docket E -011/GR -13-\n617) for rate -making purposes for the first three years after the Proposed \nTransaction is executed.  \n \nAfter reviewing the OAG -AUD’s comments and the Company’s reply comments, the \nDepartment modifies its recommendation regarding the three conditions listed above , but \nnot to the thirty conditions included in Attachment B of its earlier comments . \n  \n\nDocket No. G011/PA-14 -664  \nAnalyst assigned:  John Kundert  \nPage 2  \n \n \n \nII. DEPARTMENT ANALYSIS  \n A. OAG-RUD RECOMMENDATIONS  \n \nThe OAG -AUD included 33 recommendations in its comments.  One recommendation of \nparticular interest to the Department is OAG -AUD recommendation #32 which states:  \n \nIf MERC’s cost of debt increases during the next three calendar years, Minnesota \nratepayers will be held harmless from any rate impact un less MERC can demonstrate \nthat its increase d cost of debt was not caused by the proposed transaction.  \n The Department believes that this recommendation captures the intent of the Department’s \nrecommendations #1 and #2 included in its April 20, 2015 comment s.  Consequently, the \nDepartment supports OAG -AUD recommendation #32 and withdraw s Department \nrecommendations #1 and #2 above.     \n \nB. MERC REPLY COMMENTS  \n MERC noted in its reply comments that it opposed the Department’s third recommendation.  The Company explained t hat a ny new affiliated interest agreement between MERC and \nWisconsin Energy Corporation ( WEC ) Business Services will require Commission approval \nand that the Department’s concern regarding service costs could be addressed in that \nfuture proceedi ng.   MERC also revisited its rationale that the Department and the \nCommission can address this issue in the Company’s upcoming rate case.  \n The Department agrees with MERC’s rationale and respectfully withdraws the third \nrecommendation listed in its April 20, 2015 comments .    \n  \nIII. RECOMMENDATIONS  \n The Department recommends that the Commission approve MERC’s petition with the thirty \nconditions listed in Attachment B of its April 20, 2015 comments.  In addition, the \nDepartment recommends the following condition:  \n \nIf MERC’s cost of debt increases during the next three calendar years, Minnesota \nratepayers will be held harmless from any rate impact unless MERC can demonstrate that its increased cost of debt was not caused by the proposed transaction.  \n This condition is identical to one proposed by the OAG -AUD in its April 20, 2015 comments \nas #32.  \n In total, the Department recommends that the Commission approve the petition with the \nthirty -one conditions it has identified.  \n \n/ja \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE  \n \nI, Linda Chavez , hereby certify that I have this day served copies of the following document on \nthe attached list of persons by electronic filing, e -mail, or by depositing a true and correct copy \nthereof properly enveloped with post age paid in the United States Mail at St. Paul, Minnesota.  \n \nMINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE  – SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTS  \n \nDocket No s.

See the \"Revisions And Updates\" section\nfor details.)\n1. This article relates to S&P Global Ratings' stand-alone credit profiles\n(SACPs).\n2. SACPs refer to S&P Global Ratings' opinion of an issue's or issuer's\ncreditworthiness, in the absence of extraordinary intervention from its\nparent or affiliate or related government, and are but one component of a\nrating. We use lowercase symbols, for example 'aaa', or 'aa', to designate\nSACPs, and may modify this symbol with a \"+\" or \"-\" sign, depending on\nthe specificity of the relevant analysis. SACPs do not have outlooks and are\nnot placed on CreditWatch. We do not consider SACPs to be ratings, in\ncontrast to SPURs (S&P Global Ratings' underlying ratings), which reflect\nan issuer's credit quality without enhancement.\n3. We are publishing this article to help market participants better\nunderstand our approach to reviewing the components of ratings when\nother entities, including governments and parents, influence credit quality.3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 1/13\nMP-55 \nThis article is related to our criteria article \" ,\"\npublished on Feb. 16, 2011.\nSCOPE OF THE CRITERIA\n4. These criteria apply to the analysis of corporate and governmental\nissues and issuers globally. Please refer to specific criteria for further\ndescription of how S&P Global Ratings' uses the SACP in its analysis.\nSUMMARY OF CRITERIA UPDATE\n5. This article defines the SACP, as a rating component and not as a rating\nin itself, and reviews the symbology for the SACP.\n6. This definition supersedes all other SACP definitions in criteria articles.\n7. This paragraph has been deleted.\n8. This paragraph has been deleted.\nMETHODOLOGY\nDefinition Of Stand-Alone Credit Profile (SACP)\n9. The SACP is not a rating, but a component of the issue rating or issuer\ncredit rating (ICR). We do not assign outlooks to SACPs or place them on\nCreditWatch.\n10. S&P Global Ratings' may assign an SACP as a component of a rating to\nprovide information on an issuer's creditworthiness. The SACP is S&P\nGlobal Ratings' opinion of an issuer's creditworthiness in the absence ofPrinciples Of Credit Ratings3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 2/13\nextraordinary support or burden. It incorporates direct support already\ncommitted and the influence of ongoing interactions with the issuer's\ngroup and/or government. However, the SACP differs from the ICR in that it\ndoes not include potential future extraordinary support from a group or\ngovernment, during a period of credit stress for the issuer, except if that\nsupport is systemwide. Neither does the SACP include the potential for the\nowner or government under a stress to extract assets, capital, or liquidity\nfrom the issuer.\n11. We assign the SACP at the issuer level. It is not generally applied to\nspecific obligations, except in some cases when an issuer does not have\nan ICR. But the SACP can directly influence ratings on deferrable\ninstruments (hybrids). While we use the ICR as the starting point for rating\nnondeferrable debt, we use the SACP as the basis for rating hybrids when\nwe believe that the potential for extraordinary support does not fully\nextend to them or that extraordinary interference may even target them\nspecifically.\n12. We conceive SACPs as existing on a scale ranging from 'aaa' to 'd',\nwhich parallels the ICR rating scale, 'AAA' to 'D'. We use 'd' or 'sd' SACPs for\nissuers with 'D' or 'SD' ICRs respectively. S&P Global Ratings' uses\nlowercase letters for SACPs to indicate their status as a component of a\nrating rather than as a rating. While we attempt to refine the SACP and\nutilize \"+\" and \"-\" to graduate the scale in the same way we do for ICRs, in\nsome cases we may use category-only scoring. Text accompanying the\nSACP will discuss whether the score is a category or is refined.\n13. We recognize it is not always possible to assign an SACP, particularly\nwhen the issuer's operations and finances are closely intertwined with the\nrelated group or governmental entity's position.3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 3/13\nThe SACP Includes Ongoing Interaction/Influence\n14. The determination of an SACP includes ongoing interaction or\ninfluence, whether beneficial (positive), neutral, or burdensome (negative).\nWe also include extraordinary support when we believe it has been\ncommitted. Ongoing interaction or influence from governments includes\ninteraction with an entire sector on a continuous basis. We consider that\ngroups, including owners and affiliates, influence the SACP when there are\nregular interactions with the issuer. Table 1 presents examples of\ninfluences that we would include in determining the SACP.\nTable 1\nPositive And Negative Influences\nExamples of positive influence on\nSACPExamples of negative influence on SACP\nRecurrent operating or capital\nsubsidiesPrice ceilings\nAccess to preferential funding Risky project mandates\nAvailability of centralized group\nliquidity resourcesDirectives to provide loss-making goods and\nservices\nConferring monopoly powersDouble leverage, high shareholder-\ndistribution policies3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 4/13\nFavorable government contractsAggressive financial expectations from\nowners\nSupportive regulation Unfavorable regulatory, tax, or legal regime\nDividend policies, equity\nissuance flexibility or restriction\nApplicable tax regime\nExisting guarantees or lines of\ncredit\nUse of a group brand\nProvision of services (property,\ninvestment, payroll, shares\nsales force, etc.)\nCommitted capital or liquidity\ninjection\nSupport of financial system3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 5/13\nThe SACP Does Not Include Potential Extraordinary\nIntervention\n15. We include potential future extraordinary intervention in the ICR\ndetermination, but not in the SACP.\n16. We consider interventions as \"extraordinary\" when they are issuer-\nspecific, related to the issuer's financial stress, and nonrecurrent in\nnature. Such intervention could be in the form of support to the issuer\nfrom groups or governments or interference with the issuer from groups or\ngovernments--for example to protect such groups' or governments' own\ncredit quality--that weaken an issuer.\n17. Based on our assessment of the relationship between the issuer and\nits government or group, we form an opinion on the likelihood of timely and\nsufficient extraordinary intervention in support of the issuer meeting its\nfinancial obligations. While support can take many forms, common types\ninclude capital and liquidity injections or risk relief (table 2).\n18. In our analysis, we specify the potential sources of future extraordinary\nexternal intervention. The relevant parent may or may not be the ultimate\nparent, particularly when intermediate holding companies may exist\nbetween the issuer and the relevant parent; government intervention with\nan issuer may come from national or local public authorities; and an ICR\nmay be influenced by several parents (in the case of non-fully owned\nsubsidiaries), affiliates, and/or governments.\n19. If we expect an issue or issuer to receive extraordinary support in the\nvery near term to prevent it from defaulting, we will assign an SACP of 'cc'.3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 6/13\nTable 2\nExtraordinary Intervention\nExamples of potential\nextraordinary supportExamples of potential extraordinary interference\nDiscrete liquidity\nsupport that\ngovernments, parents, or\naffiliates provide to\nspecific entitiesSpecial taxes\nLoans from the parent or\ngovernment, or through\naffiliates or government-\nowned banksSpecial shareholder distributions\nRecapitalizations with\ncommon equity or hybrid\ninstrumentsAsset- or cash-stripping the issuer at the behest of\nthe group or government to service other\nobligations of the group or government\nArrangement of a\nsolvency rescue package\ndirectly from the\ngovernment or through\nother market\nparticipants3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 7/13\nOne-off transfers of risk\nfrom an issuer to a\ngovernmental entity, its\nparent or an affiliate to\nalleviate future stress\nTargeted increase in\nsome form of ongoing\nsupport to a specific\nentity beyond promised\nor planned levels\nREVISIONS AND UPDATES\nThis article was originally published on Oct. 1, 2010.\nChanges introduced after original publication:3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 8/13\nRELATED PUBLICATIONS\nRelated CriteriaOn Aug. 11, 2015, we updated the criteria references in this article. —\nFollowing our periodic review completed on Aug. 9, 2016, we updated\nthe contact information and deleted paragraphs 7 and 8, which were\nrelated to the initial publication of our criteria and no longer relevant.—\nFollowing our periodic review completed on Aug. 8, 2017, we updated\nthe contact information.—\nOn Sept. 19, 2019, we republished this criteria article to make\nnonmaterial changes to outdated criteria references.—\nOn Sept. 25, 2020, we republished this criteria article to make\nnonmaterial changes to update the contact information and the\n\"Related Criteria\" list.—\nOn Sept. 14, 2021, we republished this criteria article to make\nnonmaterial changes to update the \"Related Criteria\" list.—\nOn Aug. 29, 2022, we republished this criteria article to make\nnonmaterial changes to update the \"Related Criteria\" list.—\nOn Aug. 14, 2024, we republished this criteria article to make\nnonmaterial changes to update the \"Related Publications\" section.—3/29/25, 7:49 PM S&P Global Ratings\nhttps://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/6219375 9/13\nThis article is a Criteria article.
