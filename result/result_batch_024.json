PUC LEXIS 1 *\nIN THE MATTER OF THE JOINT APPLICATION OF HYDRO ONE LIMITED \nAND AVISTA CORPORATION FOR APPROVAL OF MERGER AGREEMENT\nCore Terms\nsettlement, intervenor, electric, entity, customer, merger, public utility, ownership, staff, has, public interest, \ncompany, proposed merger, transmission, shareholder, indirectly, proposed transaction, subsidiary, concert, stock, \ncost, public utilities commission, energy, resign, was\nPanel:  PAUL KJELLANDER, PRESIDENT; KRISTINE RAPER, COMMISSIONER; ERIC ANDERSON, \nCOMMISSIONER\nOpinion\nOn July 19, 2017, Avista announced that it had entered into a merger  agreement with Hydro One (\"Applicants\"). \nOn September 14, 2017, the Applicants jointly applied to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for an order \napproving the proposed merger.  The Idaho Commission is one of several regulatory bodies that must approve  the \nproposed merger.  If the Idaho Commission and other state commission and regulatory agencies approve  the \nmerger,  Avista would become a wholly owned subsidiary  of a Hydro One holding company.\nHaving carefully reviewed this extensive record, including the Application, Amended Settlement,  testimony, \nexhibits, briefs, and comments, the Commission now issues this Order denying the Application, and rejecting the \nproposed Amended Settlement  and merger. \nBACKGROUND\nOn October 5, 2017, the Commission issued Notice of the proposal and set an intervention deadline of October 26, \n2017. Idaho Forest Group, Clearwater Paper, Idaho Conservation League (\"ICL\"), the Community Action \nPartnership Association of Idaho (\"CAPAI\"), and the Washington and Northern Idaho District Council of \nLaborers [*2]  intervened as parties (collectively, \"initial intervenors\" ). Order Nos. 33903, 33914, 33916, 33931, \nand 33932. Several months later, an unincorporated nonprofit called Avista Customer  Group (\"ACG\"), and the \nIdaho Department of Water Resources (\"IDWR\") were granted late intervention. Order Nos. 34109 and 34111.\nThe parties met several times for settlement  negotiations. On April 13, 2018, the Applicants and Commission Staff  \nmoved for approval of a Stipulation and Settlement  between the Applicants, Commission Staff,  and Initial \nIntervenors.  The motion notified the Commission that all parties (other than ACG and IDWR, which had not yet \nintervened) had signed a Stipulation and Settlement  (\"Settlement\" ) that fully resolved the case.\nMP-58 \nPage 2 of 9\nOn May 16, 2018, the Commission issued notice of the Settlement,  and set a June 27, 2018, deadline for \ninterested persons to submit written comments. In June 2018, the Commission held public hearings in Moscow, \nSandpoint, and Coeur d'Alene for Avista customers  and other interested persons to testify. The Commission also \nscheduled a July 23, 2018, technical hearing. See Order Nos. 33950, 34061, and 34101. The Applicants, \nCommission Staff,  CAPAI, and ICL filed [*3]  comments in support of the Settlement. \nOn June 7, 2018, elections in the Province of Ontario, Canada, resulted in new leadership in the Province. The new \nleadership quickly fulfilled a campaign promise and, on July 11, 2018, prompted the resignation  of Hydro One's \nChief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and the entire Board of Directors. Avista reported these actions to the Commission \none week later, on July 18, 2018. Following Avista's report, the Commission vacated the technical hearing, citing \n\"the number of questions raised by the resignations, \" as the basis for postponing the technical hearing. See Order \nNo. 34111. The technical hearing was ultimately rescheduled for November 26-27, 2018.\nBefore the technical hearing occurred, in August and September 2018, the Applicants, Commission Staff,  Initial \nIntervenors,  ACG, and IDWR engaged in settlement  discussions. These discussions resulted in additional terms to \nthe Settlement.  See First Amendment to Stipulation and Settlement,  filed November 16, 2018 (\"Amended \nSettlement\" ). Applicants, Staff,  and the Initial Intervenors  signed the Amended Settlement.  Additionally, the \nApplicants, Staff,  and intervenor  CAPAI filed testimony supporting [*4]  the Amended Settlement,  and none of the \nInitial Intervenors  opposed it. ACG, on the other hand, strongly opposed the Amended Settlement.  See ACG's \nNovember 21, 2018 Response in Opposition to Motion to Admit and Approve  First Amendment to Stipulation and \nSettlement,  and supporting Affidavit of Norman M. Semanko. The final remaining party, IDWR, notified the \nCommission it had reached a separate agreement with Avista concerning Avista's water rights. With that separate \nagreement related to Avista's water rights, IDWR expressed no concern about the merger.  See August 10, 2018 \nNotice to Commission from IDWR Director Gary Spackman, and November 6, 2018 Direct Testimony of Shelley \nKeen.\nThe Commission ultimately scheduled and held a technical hearing at the Commission's office in Boise, Idaho on \nNovember 26-27, 2018. See Order Nos. 34148 and 34179. The Commission heard testimony from fifteen witnesses \nand reviewed numerous exhibits resulting in four volumes and over twelve-hundred pages of hearing transcripts. \nAdditionally, the Applicants, Staff,  and ACG filed post-hearing legal briefs regarding the applicability of Idaho Code \n§ 61-327,  [*5]  a statute that prohibits the transfer of electric  utility property in certain situations. Finally, the \nCommission received approximately 650 written comments from customers  and other interested persons, most of \nwhom opposed the merger. \nTHE APPLICATION\nAvista is an investor-owned Washington Corporation and public utility  engaged in the production, transmission,  \nand distribution of electric  power and distribution of natural gas to customers  in eastern Washington, northern \nIdaho, and parts of southern and eastern Oregon. Avista serves approximately 378,000 electric  customers  in \nWashington, Idaho, and Montana, and approximately 342,000 natural gas customers  in Washington, Idaho, and \nOregon. Alaska Energy and Resources Company, an Avista subsidiary,  provides retail electric  service in the city \nand borough of Juneau through its subsidiary  Alaska Electric  Light and Power Company.\nHydro One was a Crown Corporation owned by the Province of Ontario, until November 2015, when it was partially \nprivatized. It is now an investor-owned electric  transmission  and distribution utility headquartered in Toronto, \nOntario, Canada. The Province continues to own 47 percent of the outstanding shares. Under [*6]  provincial law \nand Hydro One's Articles of Incorporation, no other shareholder  can own more than 10 percent of the common \nshares. Beyond the status of largest shareholder,  the Province also maintains a unique governance  agreement \nwith Hydro One. Practically speaking, no one other than the Province can have a substantial influence on corporate \naffairs.\nAs previously noted, in July 2018 the Province prompted the resignation  of the Hydro One Board and CEO. On \nAugust 14, 2018, Hydro One announced its new ten-member Board of Directors, four of whom were selected by the \nProvince. Hydro One named an acting CEO, but has yet to announce a new permanent CEO. However, the 2019 Ida. PUC LEXIS 1, *2\nPage 3 of 9\nProvince will play a direct role in the CEO's compensation package, and recent news reports indicate that the \nProvince is also playing a role in selecting candidates.\nAs proposed, Avista would be acquired by Hydro One through an Idaho holding company, Olympus Equity LLC, \nwhich would acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Avista. Avista would become a wholly owned \nsubsidiary  of Olympus Equity LLC. Olympus Equity would be a bankruptcy remote entity  1 in place purely to own \nAvista and relay Avista dividends to Hydro One.  [*7]  \nTo accomplish the merger,  Avista and Hydro One require approvals from the state regulatory commissions in \nIdaho, Oregon, Montana, Alaska, and Washington. Alaska approved the proposed merger  on June 4, 2018. \nMontana approved the proposed merger  on July 10, 2018. Washington denied the merger  application on \nDecember 5, 2018. The Applicants requested reconsideration  in Washington on December 17, 2018.\nIn addition to state regulatory approval, the Applicants must also obtain approval from several federal entities.  The \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the proposed transaction on January 16, 2018. The 30-day \nwaiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 expired on April 5, 2018, meaning \nthat the parties have received antitrust clearance for the proposed merger.  Hydro One and Avista received the \nFederal Communications [*8]  Commission's consent on May 4, 2018. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the \nUnited States completed its review of the proposed merger  on May 18, 2018, and raised no national security \nconcerns about the transaction.\nPUBLIC COMMENTS\nIn recognition of the importance of this case and the public interest  expressed, the Commission held three public \nhearings in northern Idaho and accepted testimony and comments from hundreds of members of the public. Almost \neveryone who testified or commented opposed the merger.  Given the number of people who testified and \ncommented, and the broad scope of their testimonies and comments, it is impractical for us to enumerate every \nconcern or thought expressed. However, the general nature of the public testimony and comments expressed \nconcern over foreign ownership,  foreign government control of the company, increased rates, and negative service \nquality impacts.\nTHE AMENDED SETTLEMENT \nThe Amended Settlement  proposes the Commission approve  the merger,  and incorporates Company \ncommitments, rate commitments, regulatory commitments, resource-planning commitments, spending \ncommitments, and ring  fencing  provisions aimed at protecting and benefiting  [*9]  Avista customers.  By way of \nsummary, 2 the Amended Settlement  states:\n. All decision-making authority over Avista operations would belong to the Avista Board of Directors. The Board \nwould consist of nine members, the majority of which would be designated by Hydro One, with certain \nconditions regarding independence of some appointments.\n. Avista would maintain its Spokane offices, workforce, compensation, and branding.\n. There would be no rate increase because of the merger.  Rather, Avista's Idaho customers  would receive a $ \n15.8 million rate credit over a five-year period, or $ 3.2 million per year.\n. Hydro One and its subsidiaries  recognize the authority of Idaho, and the Idaho Commission, and have \ncommitted to comply, as required, with Idaho laws and Commission orders.\n. Hydro One and Avista would maintain independent finances.\n1 A bankruptcy remote entity  is a special entity  formed to hold a defined asset and to protect that asset from being administered \nas property of a bankruptcy estate.\n2 This summary highlights provisions of the Amended Settlement.  The Commission fully reviewed the entire Amended \nSettlement,  and the summary of some of its terms does not imply others were of less importance. The full terms of the \nAmended Settlement  can be viewed at the Commissions website: https://www.puc.idaho.gov/2019 Ida. PUC LEXIS 1, *6\nPage 4 of 9\n. Several ring  fencing  provisions were included in an effort to shield Avista from Hydro One liabilities, including \nbankruptcy proceedings. Other ring  fencing  provisions include a \"hold harmless\" provision, under which Hydro \nOne would hold Avista's customers  financially harmless from any business, financial, or environmental risks \nattributable [*10]  to Hydro One, and a provision to protect Avista's assets.\n. Going forward, in all resource planning, Avista would evaluate demand-side resources, renewable energy, \nand Purchase Power Agreements consistent with Commission resource evaluation rules and policies.\n. Hydro One agreed to fund $ 5.3 million for energy efficiency, weatherization, conservation, and low-income \nassistance programs over ten years. A newly created \"Energy Efficiency, Weatherization, Conservation and \nLow-income Assistance Committee\" would direct the funds, and would consist of interested stakeholders.\n. Hydro One would fund a one-time $ 7 million contribution to Avista's charitable foundation. For five-years after \nthe close of the transaction, Avista would maintain a $ 4 million annual budget for charitable contributions, and \nwould contribute $ 2 million each year to Avista's charitable foundation.\n. For accounting purposes, Hydro One and Avista would support a December 31, 2027, depreciation end of life \nrelating to Avista's ownership  in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.\n. The parties also agreed to the subordination of certain water rights.\n [*11] \nFINDINGS AND DISCUSSION\nAvista is an electric  utility subject to the Commission's regulation under the Public Utilities Law. Idaho Code §§ 61-\n119 and 61-129. The Company's rates, charges, classifications and contracts for electric  service in the State of \nIdaho are subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. This Commission has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the \nprovisions of Idaho Code §§ 61-327 and -328.\nRules 271-277 of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission Rules of Procedure ( IDAPA 31.01.01.271-277) describe the \nCommission's process for considering a settlement  stipulation. When a settlement  is presented, the Commission \nprescribes the procedures by which the Commission will consider it. In this case, the Commission received \nhundreds of comments, convened several public hearings, and held a technical hearing. IDAPA 31.01.01.274. \nProponents of a proposed settlement  must show the settlement  is reasonable, in the public interest,  or otherwise \nin accordance with  [*12]  law or regulatory policy. IDAPA 31.01.01.275. The Commission is not bound by \nsettlement  agreements. Rather, the Commission \"will independently review any settlement  proposed to it.\" IDAPA \n31.01.01.276.\nIn deciding whether the Amended Settlement  is just, fair, reasonable, and in the public interest  as required by \nRules 274 and 275, our inquiry is guided, and constrained, by Idaho Code §§ 61-327, 328. These statutes limit an \nelectric  utility's ability to sell assets in certain situations. Section 61-327 prohibits a utility from transferring  assets \nto certain entities.  If § 61-327 does not bar the transaction, then the Commission can only approve  the transaction \nif it finds that the transaction passes the public interest  and no-harm tests set forth in § 61-328. In this case, we find \nthe Applicants have failed to carry their burden under Idaho Code § 61-327.\nA. OVERVIEW OF IDAHO CODE § 61-327.\nIdaho Code § 61-327 provides:\n61-327.  [*13]   Electric  Utility Property -- Acquisition by Certain Public Agencies Prohibited. No title to \nor interest in any public utility  (as such term is defined in chapter 1, title 61, Idaho Code) property located in \nthis state which is used in the generation,  transmission,  distribution or supply of electric  power and energy to \nthe public or any portion thereof, shall be transferred or transferable to, or acquired by, directly or indirectly,  by \nany means or device whatsoever, any government or municipal corporation, quasi-municipal  corporation, or \ngovernmental or political unit, subdivision or corporation, organized or existing under the laws of any other \nstate; or any person, firm, association, corporation or organization acting as trustee, nominee, agent or 2019 Ida. PUC LEXIS 1, *9\nPage 5 of 9\nrepresentative for, or in concert  or arrangement with, any such government or municipal corporation, quasi-\nmunicipal  corporation, or governmental or political unit, subdivision or corporation; or any company, \nassociation, organization or corporation, organized or existing under the laws of this state or any other state, \nwhose issued capital stock,  or other evidence of ownership,  membership or other interest therein, or in the \nproperty [*14]  thereof, is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly,  by any such government or municipal \nCorporation, quasi-municipal  Corporation, or governmental or political unit, subdivision or Corporation; or any \ncompany, association, organization or corporation, organized under the laws of any other state, not coming \nunder or within the definition of an electric  public utility  or electrical  corporation as contained in chapter 1, title \n61, Idaho Code, and subject to the jurisdiction, regulation and control of the public Utilities commission of the \nstate of Idaho under the public Utilities law of this state; provided, nothing herein shall prohibit the transfer of \nany such property by a public utility  to a cooperative electrical  corporation organized under the laws of \nanother state, which has among its members mutual nonprofit or cooperative electrical  corporations organized \nunder the laws of the state of Idaho and doing business in this state, if such public utility  has obtained \nauthorization from the public Utilities commission of the state of Idaho pursuant to section 61-328, Idaho Code.\nIn summary, § 61-327 bars the transfer of generation,  transmission,  [*15]  or distribution and supply assets of \nIdaho regulated Utilities to certain defined entities.  Specifically, § 61-327 prohibits a utility from transferring  assets \nto four kinds of transferees:  1) A \"government … or political unit existing under the laws of any other state;\" 2) \"any \norganization acting as … representative for, or in concert  … with, any such government ...;\" 3) \"any company … \nwhose issued capital stock,  or other evidence of ownership  … is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly,  by any \n… governmental or political unit;\" and 4) \"any … organization or corporation organized under the laws of any other \nstate, not coming within the definition of an electric  public utility  or electrical  corporation....\"\nBecause this statute pertains to the sale or transfer of ownership  interest in electric  facilities in Idaho, it applies to \nthe merger  in this case.\nIn interpreting this statute, we are guided by Idaho Code § 73-113, which states:\n1) The language of a statute should be given its plain, usual and ordinary meaning. Where a statute is clear \nand unambiguous, the expressed intent of the legislature shall be given effect without [*16]  engaging in \nstatutory construction. The literal words of a statute are the best guide to determining legislative intent.\n2) If a statute is capable of more than one (1) conflicting construction, the reasonableness of the proposed \ninterpretations shall be considered, and the statute must be construed as a whole. Interpretations which would \nrender the statute a nullity, or which would lead to absurd results, are disfavored.\n3) Words and phrases are construed according to the context and the approved usage of the language, but \ntechnical words and phrases, and such others as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law, or \nare defined in the succeeding section, are to be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning \nor definition.\nB. THE PROPOSED TRANSFER\nAs an initial matter, Idaho Code § 61-327 is triggered because Avista proposes to transfer an interest in its Idaho-\nbased generation,  transmission,  and distribution property. The Applicants proposal to transfer all Avista stock to a \nHydro One entity  is a de facto transfer of Avista and its assets. In this case, the Applicants propose to transfer full \nownership  [*17]  of Avista--a public utility  that owns Idaho-based generation,  transmission,  or distribution \nproperty--to a Hydro One entity.  Hydro One will become the sole shareholder  of Avista and Avista's interest in its \nproperty would persist only as a Hydro One subsidiary. \nThe threshold question this Commission must answer is whether Avista is transferring  its assets to a transferee  \nprohibited under § 61-327. This Commission's statutory duty to consider whether the proposed merger  would be \njust, fair, reasonable, in the public interest  and otherwise in accordance with Idaho law and regulatory policy \ndemands that we address the documented, contractual and ongoing control that the Province of Ontario exerts over \nHydro One. We cannot approve  the proposal if Avista's transfer to Hydro One amounts to a transfer to \"any \norganization acting as … representative for, or in concert. .. with, any such government ...;\" or \"any company … 2019 Ida. PUC LEXIS 1, *13\nPage 6 of 9\nwhose issued capital stock,  or other evidence of ownership  … is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly,  by any \n… governmental or political unit.\" Id.\nAs explained in greater detail below, we find § 61-327 bars the transaction because Hydro One is a prohibited [*18]  \ntransferee. \n1. Hydro One is directly and indirectly  subject to the control and ownership  interest of the Province of \nOntario.\nHydro One was a Crown Corporation wholly owned by the Province until November 2015. As previously stated, the \nProvince remains its largest shareholder --owning 47 percent of the outstanding shares. Pursuant to provincial law \nand Hydro One's Articles of Incorporation, no other shareholder  may own any more than ten percent of the \noutstanding shares. These provisions operate to ensure that no other single shareholder  can secure a significant or \ncontrolling influence in Hydro One greater than the Province. Moreover, the 2015 governance  agreement and the \n2018 letter agreement between Hydro One and the Province spell out how Hydro One will be governed, including \nthe special role the provincial government serves over Hydro One. The Applicants asserted through testimony and \nbriefing that the Province is merely a shareholder,  and not a manager of Hydro One. However, the events that \nbegan in June 2018 and continue to present day, prove otherwise.\nPrior to June 2018, Hydro One's then CEO, Mayo Schmidt, declared that the governance  agreement would \n\"ensure that Hydro [*19]  One's business and operations are completely independent from the government of the \nProvince of Ontario.\" Tr. 563-64. Contrary to all assertions made by both Hydro One and Avista to this Commission, \nin June 2018 the Province caused the resignation  of the entire Hydro One Board of Directors and the removal of \nthe Mr. Schmidt. These events caused a downgrade in Hydro One's credit rating and significant delays and cost \nincreases in the regulatory proceedings surrounding this merger.  Further, the Province executed management-\nlevel control by altering the structure of the Board, modifying contractual compensation packages, and participating \nin additional oversight ordinarily reserved to the Board of Directors and other executive officers. Tr. 793. The \nPremier continues to promise publicly a 12 percent reduction in rates to Hydro One's consumers. Tr. 335-337.\nWe find that the language of the controlling statute, when given its plain, usual and ordinary meaning is clear and \nleads us to the conclusion that Hydro One is both indirectly  and directly controlled by the ownership  interest of and \ndeference to the Province of Ontario. Merriam-Webster defines \"in concert\"  as an \"agreement in design [*20]  or \nplan,\" and \"arrangement\" as \"an informal agreement or settlement  especially on personal, social, or political \nmatters.\" The Merriam-Webster Dictionary (New Edition 2016). \"Control\" amounts to \"the direct and indirect power \nto govern the management and policies of a person or entity  whether through ownership  of voting securities, by \ncontract, or by otherwise; the power or authority to manage, direct, or oversee.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. \n2014). Hydro One is a party to both a governance  agreement and a letter agreement with the Province. The \nApplicants testified that these agreements protect Hydro One's independence. However, Hydro One Board \nmembers disregarded provisions of the governance  agreement intended to protect the utility's shareholders  when \nthey stepped down under political pressure. Tr. 791-793.\nIt is beyond dispute that the Province's control of Hydro One also led to a restructuring of the Board of Directors, \nfrom fourteen to ten Board members, and removal and yet-to-occur replacement of the CEO. Additionally, the \nretention of the Hydro One CEO requires a two-thirds percent vote of the Board. Tr. 58-59. Because the Province of \nOntario controls the appointment  [*21]  of 40 percent of the Board, Provincial appointees can replace the CEO \nannually. See Tr. 15. This further evidences the control and influence the Province has over the Company at any \ngiven time. Further, the Premier of the provincial government has publicly declared that Hydro One is not a private \ncorporation. Tr. 800-802.\nWe recognize that the parties have proposed significant ring  fencing  to protect Avista's property and its customers.  \nHowever, no provision can change Hydro One's status as Avista's proposed owner or the authority imposed on \nHydro One by the Province of Ontario. Even the newly seated Chair of the Board of Directors, Thomas Woods, \nadmitted the governance  agreement does not prevent the Province from making further attempts to manage Hydro \nOne. Tr. 110-111.2019 Ida. PUC LEXIS 1, *17\nPage 7 of 9\nIt is abundantly clear that the Province does not have to own 51 percent of Hydro One in order to effectively control \nthe company. Based on the recent events surrounding the Province's intrusions into Hydro One corporate affairs, \nany other conclusion would be unreasonable and ignorant in light of the uncontested facts and evidence. \nConsequently, we find that Hydro One has acted in concert  with the Province of Ontario,  [*22]  formally and \ninformally, directly and indirectly. \n2. The provincial government of Ontario is the government of another state.\nWhile Idaho Code § 61-327 prohibits a public utility  from transferring  an interest in Idaho-based assets to the \ngovernment of \"any other state,\" the statute does not define what constitutes \"any other state.\" A Standard \ndictionary definition of \"state\" broadly refers to \"the political system of a body of people who are politically \norganized; a system of rules by which jurisdiction and authority are exercised over such a body of people.\" Black's \nLaw Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Thus, a plain reading of the statute would naturally include not only other states \nwithin the United States, but also territories, foreign nations, and Canadian provinces. Idaho case law supports this \nclear and unambiguous reading. See Idaho Power Co. v. State of Idaho, 104 Idaho 575, 589 (\"[Section] 327 \nprovides generally that property in this state used in the generation  or transmission  of electricity shall not be \ntransferred in any manner to out-of-state organizations, governmental entities,  or any entity    [*23]  not subject to \nregulation by the PUC.\") (emphasis added).\nThe Applicants defend a much more narrow reading of the statute. The Applicants contend that \"any other state\" \nmeans \"any other state of the United States,\" and excludes any consideration of foreign provinces or alien nations. \nSee Tr. at 138-141, and Applicant's Brief at 9-10. We disagree. The Applicants' narrow concept of state would yield \nthe absurd result of prohibiting purchases by entities  owned by other states of the United States, while allowing \nsuch transactions if the entity  is owned by a foreign country. We find that the plain language used by the \nlegislature, when read in context and given its ordinary meaning, includes foreign entities  such as the province of \nOntario within the meaning of \"state.\"\nConsequently, we cannot approve  the proposed transfer of Avista's assets to Hydro One. The proposal amounts to \na transfer of Idaho-based utility generation,  transmission,  distribution and supply assets to an organization acting \nin concert  with, and controlled by, a government of another state. Hydro One is not purely a private, publicly traded \ncorporation. Rather, the management of Hydro One is subject to the Province's [*24]  political pressure, legislative \npower, and special governance  agreements. The prohibitions of Idaho Code § 61-327 cannot be nullified with \ngenerous settlement  terms and robust ring-fencing provisions.\nWe continue to recognize that, \"[w]ith the increased globalization of economies and cultures, the concept of an \n'American' company is becoming more obscure. Today's increasingly competitive markets require businesses to \nsearch far and wide for materials, labor, and business opportunities. Large businesses whose stock is publicly \ntraded in this country are often owned, at least in part, by foreign interests. Similarly, U.S. corporations and \nindividuals often engage in the acquisition of or partnership with foreign businesses.\" Order No. 28213. In this \ninstance, it is Hydro One's lack of independence from the governmental entity  that dictates our decision to reject \nthe proposed merger  between Hydro One and Avista. The burden to establish that the proposal complies with \nIdaho law rests with the Applicants. IDAPA 31.01.01.275. We find the Applicants have failed to establish that the \nproposed settlement   [*25]  is in accordance with Idaho Code § 61-327. Our decision is supported by substantial \nand competent evidence compiled through a vigorous and thorough effort by all parties to present a complete \nrecord for our review.\nC. Idaho Code § 61-328\nBecause we have determined Idaho Code § 61-327 is dispositive of the proposed transaction, we do not decide \nwhether Idaho Code § 61-328 might also bar the proposal. Section 61-328, in summary, precludes the Commission \nfrom approving a transaction unless: (a) the transaction is consistent with the public interest;  (b) the transaction will \nnot increase the cost of and rates for supply service; and (c) the transferee  has the bona fide intent and financial \nability to operate and maintain the property in the public service. While we do not base our decision here on these \npublic interest  standards, it would be reasonable and fair to consider the same and similar facts that dictated our 2019 Ida. PUC LEXIS 1, *21\nPage 8 of 9\ndecision under § 61-327. Any evaluation of the public interest  would, undeniably, take into account the \nprovincial [*26]  politics and circumstances under which Hydro One's CEO and entire Board of Directors resigned.\nThis Commission remains concerned about the outer limits of the Province's power over Hydro One. We are not \nconvinced that the Province shares Hydro One's philosophy that the Company be independent. We also note that \nthe testimony provided by Hydro One witnesses was constructed in furtherance of an approved settlement  \nagreement. Attempts to solicit more detail at hearing about the Province's intrusions on Hydro One management \nwere met with less than persuasive responses. Furthermore, Hydro One lacks that authority to make commitments \nthat would bind the Province.\nOur decision to reject the proposed transaction and Amended Settlement  does not hinge on these considerations. \nHowever, we offer them as a caution to the parties. To be clear, in any analysis of Idaho Code § 61-328, this \nCommission would strictly scrutinize the facts and evidence, through additional hearings and testimony if needed, to \nassess whether the proposed transaction ultimately could satisfy Idaho Code § 61-328.\nINTERVENOR  FUNDING \nIntervenor  [*27]  funding  is available under Idaho Code § 61-617A and Rules 161-165. Idaho Code § 61-617A(1) \nstates it is the \"policy of [Idaho] to encourage participation at all stages of all proceedings before this Commission \nso that all affected customers  receive full and fair representation in those proceedings.\" The statute authorizes the \nCommission to order any regulated utility with intrastate annual revenues exceeding $ 3.5 million to pay all or a \nportion of the costs of one or more parties. Idaho Code § 61-617A(2).\nIntervenor  funding  costs include legal fees, witness fees, and transportation and other expenses so long as the \ntotal funding  for all intervening parties does not exceed $ 40,000 in any proceeding. Id. The Commission must \nconsider the following factors when deciding whether to award intervenor  funding: \n1) That the participation of the intervenor  has materially  contributed to the Commission's decision;\n2) That the costs of intervention are reasonable in amount and would be a significant financial hardship for the \nintervenor; \n3) The recommendation made [*28]  by the intervenor  differs materially  from the testimony and exhibits of the \nCommission Staff;  and\n4) The testimony and participation of the intervenor  addressed issues of concern to the general body of \ncustomers. \nId. To obtain an award of intervenor  funding,  an intervenor  must further comply with Rules 161-165. IDAPA \n31.01.01.161-165. The petition must contain an itemized list of expenses broken down into categories, a statement \nexplaining why the costs constitute a significant financial hardship, and a statement showing the class of customer  \non whose behalf the intervenor  participated. Rule 162; IDAPA 31.01.01.162.\nHere, the Commission received three timely intervenor-funding petitions: ACG, for $ 24,412.37; CAPAI, for $ \n17,045; and ICL, for $ 12,950. CAPAI and ICL provided detailed breakdowns of the time their legal staff  spent on \nthe case. ACG summarized the work its lawyer completed.\nIn considering the requests, the Commission reviewed the Petitions, and the record of proceedings. Consistent with \nthe policy expressed in Idaho Code § 61-617A [*29]  , we encourage intervenors  to participate in cases and \ndecisions before us. Based on their testimony and participation in this matter, we find that the Petitions for \nIntervenor  Funding  filed by ACG, CAPAI, and ICL generally comport with the procedural and technical \nrequirements set forth in Rules 161-165 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure. We thus find that the intervenors  \nhave satisfied the criteria for an intervenor  funding  award under Idaho Code § 61-617A.\nWe find that ACG, CAPAI, and ICL all materially  contributed to our decision in this matter by addressing issues \nimportant to our consideration. CAPAI and ICL added perspectives from environmental and low-income groups and \nrepresented their respective interests through two settlement  agreements. ACG represented the interest of 2019 Ida. PUC LEXIS 1, *25\nPage 9 of 9\ncustomers  who opposed the merger,  and provided valuable perspective regarding Idaho Code § 61-327. We note \nthat the intervenors  participated in scheduled negotiations, prepared and evaluated discovery. However, ACG \nbecame a party to the case nearly four months after CAPAI and ICL began participating. All intervenors  were \npresent [*30]  and actively participated at the technical hearing. Each intervenor's  position materially  differed from \nthe Applicants and Staff  evidence and positions. We also find that the intervenors  addressed issues relevant to all \nconsumers, provided us with a more complete framework in which to evaluate the case and render a decision in the \npublic interest.  We further find that the intervenors  would suffer financial hardship without access to some \nintervenor  funding.  CAPAI and ICL provided detailed breakdowns of the time spent on their particular portion of \nthis case, billing 70 and 74 hours respectively. ACG provided a more generic breakdown that included 98 hours of \nattorney time. Notably, CAPAI and ICL participated in this case since its inception, nearly four months longer than \nACG. Accordingly, we feel it is appropriate to adjust ACG's time. The less than detailed billing provided by ACG \nmakes an adjustment more difficult. However, we find that a downward adjustment of 24 hours (from 98 hours to 74 \nhours) is appropriate considering the time allocations claimed by the other intervenors. \nFinally, while we recognize the value of the contributions of the intervenors,  we are limited to a cumulative [*31]  \naward of $ 40,000. Therefore, in the interest of fairness, with acknowledgment of the substantial value their \nparticipation added to the record and our deliberation and ultimate decision, we find that, after ACG's adjustment, \nthe intervenors  contributed to a substantially similar degree, which leads us to an approximately equal distribution \nof intervenor  funds. Accordingly, we find it appropriate to grant the Petitions and award intervenor  funding  as \nfollows: $ 15,813.87 to ACG; $ 13,744.02 to CAPAI; and $ 10,442.11 to ICL. These awards shall be chargeable to \nthe residential and small commercial classes. Idaho Code § 61-617A(3).\nORDER\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Admit and Approve  First Amendment to Stipulation and Settlement  is \ndenied. The proposed transaction is not in accordance with Idaho Code § 61-327. Accordingly, the Joint Application \nfor an Order Authorizing Proposed Transaction is also denied.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the intervenor-funding petitions of the ACG, CAPAI, and ICL are granted in part. \nAvista shall promptly pay $ 15,813.87 to ACG, $ 13,744.02 to CAPAI, and $ 10,442.11 [*32]  to ICL, chargeable to \nthe residential and small commercial classes.\nTHIS IS A FINAL ORDER. Any person interested in this Order may petition for reconsideration  within twenty-one \n(21) days of the service date of this Order. Within seven (7) days after any person has petitioned for \nreconsideration,  any other person may cross-petition for reconsideration.  See Idaho Code § 61-626.\nDONE by Order of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission at Boise, Idaho this 3rd day of January 2019.\nPAUL KJELLANDER, PRESIDENT\nKRISTINE RAPER, COMMISSIONER\nERIC ANDERSON, COMMISSIONER\nID Public Utilities Commission                Decisions\nEnd of Document2019 Ida.

The Commission  \naccordingly “shall not approve” the transaction, as required under RCW 80.12.020. The \nCommission finds, in addition, that the proposed transaction “is not consistent with the public \ninterest” in consideration of which “it shall deny the application” under WAC 480 -143-170.  \nThe Commission takes fully into account in making these findings the 81 original and  amended  \ncommitments , and  one additional express commitment , alon g with amendments,  to which Avista, \nHydro One and all other parties in this proceeding agreed in a Settlement Stipulation dated \nMarch 27, 2018, and subsequently amended on May 7, 2018 , and October 19, 2018 . The \nCommission recognizes that these 82 commitmen ts, among other things, emphasize important \npublic service obligations including:  \n• Local presence commitments concerning  Avista’s directors, officers, line \nemployees, and corporate headquarters.  \n• Staffing, management, governance, record keeping requirements,  assured \naccess to records, and reporting commitments that protect and promote the \nCommission’s ability to regulate Avista in the public interest.  \n• Rate commitments including beneficial rate credits and other protections for \ncustomers from rate increases that might otherwise result following the \ntransaction.  \nMP-59\nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE II \nORDER 07  \n \n• Regulatory and ring -fencing commitments that protect Avista from any \nfinancial distress that may be experienced by other companies within the \ncorporate structure.  \n• Financial integrity commitments that p rotect Avista’s financial health.  \n• Reliability and service quality commitments.  \n• Commitments to the communities in Avista’s service territories, including \nTribal and low -income communities.  \n• Environmental, renewable -energy, and energy efficiency commitments.  \nThe Commission received into the record during a Settlement Hearing on May 22, 2018, \nevidence about the commitments and the context in which they were proposed including evidence \nconcerning the risks posed by the Province of Ontario’s 47 percent ownership share as Hydro \nOne’s largest shareholder. The Commission also heard testimony and received into the record \nadditional evidence concerning certain financial benefits  promised by the Joint Applicants,  \nincluding rate credits to customers  and funding for various programs  that address customer \ninterests, interests of the intervenors, and community interests in Avista’s service territory . \n \nOn June 7, 2018, provincial elections in Ontario resulted in the Progressive Conservative Party \n(PCP)  gaining a majority  in the Legislative Assembly. The PCP included prominently in its \nelection campaign  a promise to fire Hydro One’s Chief Executive Officer  (CEO)  and replace the \nentire Board of Directors. The PCP majority was seated on June 29, 2018. Less than two weeks \nlater, on July 11, 2018, Hydro One  and the provinc ial government  entered into, and made \npublic, a Letter Agreement that provided for the removal and replacement of the entire Hydro \nOne Board of Directors by August 15, 2018, and the immediate “retirement” of t he CEO.   \n \nThis sudden and complete change in Hydro One’s leadership  at the instance of its former owner \nand largest  shareholder, the Province of Ontario, along with certain legislation passed quickly \ninto law following the change in government leadership , demonstrates that Hydro One remains \nsubject to management control by the province and that the province may not limit itself, or \nallow itself to be limited, to the role of “ shareholder” as  had been represented to the \nCommission . It became clear on and afte r July 11, 2018, that Hydro One’s directors cannot be \nconsidered independent and the province’s role is not  limited to  that a minority shareholder  in a \npublicly  traded corporation . Nor can the Governance Agreement  between Hydro One and the \nprovince  be considered protective of Hydro One’s status as a publicly  traded corporation.  The \nrecord, as supplemented on October 23, 2018, shows that the provincial government retained \nsufficient power and influence over the Board  of Directors  following privatizat ion beginning in \nNovember 2015  to result in its agreement to resign en masse , and to remov al of the CEO, within \ndays after a new majority party was seated in Ontario. This was made possible by t he board ’s \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE III \nORDER 07  \n \nagree ment  with the province to waive provisions of the Governance Agreement that were meant \nto protect  the interests of  all shareholders, not the political interests of the majority party in \nOntario at any given time . The board acted without a due diligence review of the potential \nadverse impacts of the pr ecipitous changes in direction and executive management to which it \nagreed. These changes, in fact, caused harm to Hydro One and its shareholders, and to Avista \nand its shareholders.  \nIn addition, the  Ontario Minister of Energy introduced  on July 16, 2018 , Bill 2, the Urgent \nPriorities Act, 2018 , which included in Schedule 1 the Hydro One Accountability Act. The new \nprovincial government passed Bill 2  into law and it became effective on August 15, 2018. This \nnew law g ave the province a direct and active role  in setting , and continuing oversight of,  \nexecutive compensation at Hydro One. The law also amended the Ontario Energy Board Act, \n1998, to prohibit the inclusion in rates of compensation paid to the CEO and executives of Hydro \nOne. There appears to be noth ing that would prevent this level of interference from occurring \nagain if the government leadership becomes dissatisfied in some regard with decisions by the \nnew board of directors or with the new CEO , or simply due to political considerations without \nregard to sound business practices . Indeed, additional legislation may be  forthcoming to \neffectuate a 12 percent rate reduction promised by the new government.  In other words, Hydro \nOne continues to be subject fully to the provincial government and the politic al will of its \nleadership.  \nThese sudden and unexpected developments caused the Commission to issue on July 12, 2018, a \nNotice of Intent to Conduct Additional Process  and Opportunity for Parties to Submit Comments . \nThe Commission issued on July 20, 2018, a Notice of Extension of Time for Process and \nDeliberation  as allowed under R CW 80.12.030(2) , providing, among other things, that it would \nenter a Final Order by December 14, 2018 . On August 3, 2018, the Commission issued a Notice \nof Procedural Schedule  for the Conduct of Additional Process , which included notice of a \nhearing scheduled for October 23, 2018 . \n \nFollowing the receipt of supplemental testimony and exhibits , the Commission heard oral \ntestimony on October 23, 2018, in response to its questions concerning the election and post -\nelection events affecting Hydro One and how the  impacts of these events  should be weighed in \nconsidering the Joint Application and the p arties ’ Settlement Stipulation in which they agreed to \nadvocate for Commission approval of the proposed transaction. In the final analysis, the \nCommission determines that the evidence demonstrate s that Hydro One lacks sufficient \nindependence from its forme r owner and now largest  shareholder, the Province of Ontario, to be \na reasonable and appropriate  merger partner for Avista.  The events following the provincial \nelection in June 2018 demonstrate the material and significant risk of the proposed transaction \nto Avista’s customers  that results from the Province of Ontario’s domina nt ownership interest in \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE IV \nORDER 07  \n \nHydro One and the willingness of the provincial government to exert its dominance in ways that \nare contrary to the best interests of Hydro One and, by extensio n, Avista, were it to be owned by \nHydro One . The financial  and other  benefits for Avista customers and the broader public \npromised by the transaction, including rate credits, are inadequate to compensate for  the risk s of \nharm Avista’s customers would face were we to approve this transaction.  \n \nAll things considered, as detailed in the body of this Order, the Commission determines that the \nproposed transaction fails to protect adequately against the risks inherent in the proposed \nchange in Avista’s ownership , fails to provide a net benefit to Avista’s customers, and fails to \nprotect and further the broader public interest. It accordingly must be denied under the \nstandards established by RCW 80.12.020 and WAC 480 -143-170. The Commission, in this \nOrder, denies the Joint Application for Transfer of Property by which Avista would become an \nindirect, wholly  owned subsidiary of Hydro One.  \n \n  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE V \nORDER 07  \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nSUMMARY  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .... 1 \nMEMORANDUM  ................................ ................................ ................................ ..........................  7 \nI.

On September 14, 2017, Avista  Corporation  (Avista)  and Hydro One  \nLimited (Hydro One), acting through Olympus Equity LLC, an indirect, wholly  owned \nsubsidiary , filed their Joint  Application for an Order Authorizing Proposed Transaction .1 \nIf approved,  Olympus Equity LLC would acquire all of the outstanding common stock of \nAvista , which would become a direct, wholly  owned subsidiary of Olympus Equity LLC . \nAvista , thus,  would be  an indirect, wholly  owned subsidiary of Hydro One.2 Avista’s \nshareholders approved the transaction on November 1, 2017. They would receive, upon \napproval, $53.00 per common share, representing a 24 percent premium to Avista’s  sale \nprice of $42.74 per share on July 18, 2017.3 The Joint Applicants  initially  hoped to obtain \nall required regulatory approvals and close the transaction by September 30, 2018.  This \nlater changed in Washington to December 14, 2018.  \n2 Avista  is an investor -owned utility providing electric generation, transmission, and \ndistribution services to approximately 378,000 retail customers in Washington, Idaho, \nand Montana, and the distribution of natural gas to approximately 342,000 retail \ncustomers in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. Avista is a public service company subject \nto the Commission’s jurisdiction. Commission authorization is necessary under RCW \n80.12.020 for Avista to sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of, merge, or consolidate, \nany o f its franchises, properties, or facilities with any other public service company. \nUnder RCW 80.12.040, Commission authorization is necessary before another public \nservice company can, directly or indirectly, purchase, acquire, or become the owner of \nany o f Avista’s franchises, properties, facilities, capital stocks, or bonds.4 \n                                                 \n1 More specifically,  Olympus Equity LLC, a wholly owned Alaska limited -liability company and \ncorporate subsidiary of Hydro One,  a Province of Ontario corporation, proposes to  acquire all \noutstanding common stock of Avista, a Washington corporation and a jurisdictional public \nservice company, making Avista a direct, wholly -owned subsidiary of Olympus Equity LLC and \nan indirect, wholly -owned subsidiary of Hydro One . \n2 We refer to Avista and Hydro One collectively  in this Order, as “Joint Applicants” or \n“Companies.”  \n3 Morris, Exh. SLM -1T at 7:3 -5. \n4 Neither Hydro One nor Olympus Equity LLC is a public service company subject to the \nCommission’s jurisdiction. However, they have effectively submitted to the Commission’s \njurisdiction for purposes of this proceeding and the Settlement commitments that ar e central to \nour consideration of their application include agreements to submit to Commission authority, and \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 2 \nORDER 07  \n \n3 Hydro One, operating through its principal subsidiary, Hydro One Inc., was a Crown \nCorporation  until November 2015 . It now is an investor -owned electric transmission and \ndistribution  utility headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Hydro One provides \nelectric distribution service to more than 1.3 million retail end -use customers, as well as \nelectric transmission service to many local distribution companies and large industrial \ncusto mers. The Province of Ontario remains its largest shareholder , owning 47 percent of \nthe shares outstanding.  Under provincial law and Hydro One’s Articles of Incorporation, \nno other shareholder can own more than 10 percent  of the common shares outstanding.5 \nThis has the effect of ensuring that no one other than the Province could potentially have \na controlling influence or even a substantial influence on corporate affairs .6  \n4 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the proposed transaction on \nJanuar y 16, 2018. The 30 -day waiting period under the Hart -Scott -Rodino Antitrust \nImprovements Act of 1976 expired on April 5, 2018, meaning that the parties have \nreceived anti -trust clearance for the proposed merger. Hydro One and Avista received the \nFederal Co mmunications Commission’s consent on May 4, 2018. The Committee on \nForeign Investment in the United States completed its review of the proposed merger on \nMay 18, 2018, and concluded that there are no unresolved national security concerns with \nrespect to th e transaction.  \n5 Avista requires approvals from the state regulatory commissions in Idaho, Oregon, \nMontana, Alaska , and Washington . The Regulatory Commission of Alaska accepted for \nfiling on April 3, 2018, a proposed full settlement.7 The Alaska Commission e ntered its \nOrder No. 8 − Order Accepting Stipulation In Part − on May 1, 2018, in Docket U -17-\n097(8).8 After additional process, the Alaska Commission entered Order No. 9 on June 4, \n2018, approving the transaction subject to the condition that Avista and H ydro One \n                                                 \nin some circumstances to Washington judicial authorities, as necessary to preserve the \nCommission’s authority over Avista and its operations.  \n5 Woods, Exh.

A further order will be issued.” Order No. 8 at 7:18 -21. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 3 \nORDER 07  \n \nadhere to the Stipulation commitments and several related commitments identified in the \norder.9  \n6 On May 15, 2018, the Joint Applicants and the City of Colstrip filed their proposed \nsettlement with the Montana Public Service Commission (PSC). On June 12, 2018, the \nMontana Public Service Commission approved the settlement, with modifications, by \nmajorit y vote. The Montana PSC issued its final order approving the proposed merger on \nJuly 10, 2018.  \n7 The Public Utility Commission of Oregon, on May 25, 2018, accepted for filing an all -\nparties, all -issues settlement agreement, as did the Idaho Public Utilities Commission on \nApril 13, 2018. These are pending as of the date of this Order.  \n8 The Commission has jurisdiction over transactions such as this one where it is proposed \nthat “the control of a plainly jurisdictional public utility [will change] through a corpo rate \ntransaction for the transfer of the whole or a controlling interest in the company.”10 The \nparties filed a Settlement Stipulation in Washington on March 27, 2018.  \n9 PARTY  REPRESENTATIVES .

In two important respects, however, this is a case of first \nimpression. First, as we discuss  in more detail  below, the standard under which the \nCommission must consider this transaction changed in 2009 from the “no harm” standard \nto a “net b enefit” standard. Briefly, we must weigh the inherent risks of the transaction \nagainst its promised benefits and determine that the benefits more than compensate for \nany unavoidable risks so that customers are better off with the transaction than without i t. \n12 Second,  we were confronted very late in this case  with developing facts  that undermined \nmore or less completely assurances we had been given earlier concerning political risks \nassociated with the large ownership interest in Hydro One retained by the Pro vince of \nOntario. Hydro One’s witnesses testified that the Governance Agreement between Hydro \nOne and the province would  protect  Avista going forward because it protected  Hydro \nOne’s independence as a publicly  traded  commercial corporation  that would not be \n                                                 \n12 Mr. Gerhart gave notice of his appearance and his substitution as counsel for Sierra Club on \nOctober 11, 2018, substituting for Ms. Gloria Smith, who withdrew as counsel, having previously \nentered her appearance and notice of subst itution for Sierra Club’s former counsel, Mr. Travis \nRitchie, who withdrew as counsel on September 18, 2018.  \n13 The Northwest Industrial Gas Users (NWIGU) merged into the Industrial Consumers of \nNorthwest Utilities (ICNU) on March 31, 2018, and ICNU changed  its name to Alliance of \nWestern Energy Consumers (AWEC) on April 1, 2018.

Effectively i gnoring  the letter, and \nthe spirit and intent , of the Governance Agreement, the entire Board of Directors agreed \nwith the province to waive the protections provided to all shareholders under section 4.7 \nof the Governance A greement in favor of one shareholder, the  province . The entire board  \nagreed to resign  by mid -August 2018 . In addition, again contrary to the Governance \nAgreement, the province  effectively ousted Hydro One’s Chief Executive Officer, \ncausing him to retire  immediately . The province also involved itself, through legislation, \nin management decision -making and ongoing oversight ordinarily reserved to the board \nof directors and executive officers of a private  corporation.  The provincial government \nalso promises to lower Hydro One’s rates by a specific  percentage  apparently  without \nhaving first consider ed the impact this could have on the safety and reliability of services \nHydro One provides, or financial implications that conceivably could affect Avista’s \nfinancial decisions  and operations as a subsidi ary of Hydro One.15 \n14 The combined effect of the sudden and unexpected retirement of Hydro One’s CEO and \nthe announced resignation of the  entire board of directors within days after the new \ngovernment was seated in Ontario , and the new legislation involving t he Province \ndirectly in Hydro One’s management decisions  and oversight , unquestionably harmed \nHydro One and Avista. It cannot credibly be maintained that these actions  by the \nprovince and resulting changes at Hydro One  were in the best interests of Hydro O ne or \n                                                 \n14 Exh. MMS -5 (Governance Agreement between Hydro One and the Province of Ontario, dated \nNovember 5, 2015).  Mr. Scarlett described  the Governance Agreement  as a “carefully thought \nthrough and structured arrangement” necessary to the success of privatization. See Scarlett, TR \n325:9 -326:8.  \n15 Looking to the future, it is easy enough to imagine that actions by the province that strain \nHydro One’s revenue could r esult in pressure being brought to bear on Avista, whose directors \nwould have a fiduciary duty to their shareholder ( i.e., Hydro One) to limit expenditures so as to \nmaximize the retained earnings available to dividend up to Hydro One. Mr. Dobson testified that \nHydro One will be able to use dividends from Avista to support its operating costs and to \ncontribute to Hydro One’s capital needs. TR 478:20 -479:5.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 6 \nORDER 07  \n \nAvista.16 These actions  caused significant losses of shareholder value at both \ncorporations, downgrades to Hydro One’s credit ratings,  downgrades by equity analysts, \nand disruption of the regulatory processes in three states concerning whether Hydro \nOne’s acquisition of Avista should be approved . In addition,  the new government \ncontrols  and the potential for further interference by the province in Hydro One’s affairs  \ncould have an adverse effect on earnings and Hydro One’s ability to attract and retain \ntalented leadership . All of t his raises fundamental concerns about Hydro One’s suitability \nas a merger partner and owner of Avista . The unavoidable risks of the proposed \ntransaction associated with the province’s evident intent and ability to participate directly \nin the direction and management of Hydro One in ways that are harmful to the enterprise, \nwhich would include Avista, are s ignificant.  \n15 Applying the net benefit standard under these unique circumstances, t he Commission \nmust determine first whether the proposed transaction protects customers adequately \nfrom the potential harm that might follow from the inherent risks it poses. B eyond that, \nwe must find that the proposed transaction provides a net benefit to Avista’s customers. \nWe find that it does neither. The risks and potential consequences for Avista of political \ninterference in Hydro One’s commercial operations are simply too  great relative to the \nmarginal benefits offered through the Settlement Stipulation. Moreover, the proposed \ntransaction cannot be said to be consistent with the public interest when it is evident that \ndecisions affecting  Hydro One ’s and Avista’s business o perations and financial integrity \nare subject to political considerations  that may motivate one provincial leader  or another \nto make decisions and take actions in the future that may cause harm  instead of \n                                                 \n16 Asked whether he believed that “the sudden resignation of the board of directors and CEO of \nHydro One  was in the best interest of either” Hydro One or Avista, Mr. Woods, the new \nChairman of the Hydro One Board, responded as to both with a straightforward: “No.” Mr. \nMorris, asked the same question relative to Avista’s best interests also answered: “No.” TR  \n368:21 -369:6. Although Mr. Scarlett testified to his belief that the board and CEO took these \nactions because they were in Hydro One’s best interest, neither of them offered any testimony \nexplaining this perspective other than to suggest it expedited what  they considered to be an \ninevitable result. See Scarlett, TR 401:6 -402:18. The Joint Applicants did not bring forward any \nwitness who had first -hand knowledge of the board’s, or Mr. Schmidt’s, thinking on the subject, \nor any written evidence, such as minu tes from a board meeting, that would provide illumination. \nSee Scarlett, TR 406:4 -408:13. Mr. Scarlett testified, however, that to the best of his knowledge \nthere was little or no discussion before the July 11, 2018, press release announcing the board’s \nresignation and the CEO’s retirement of the potential impacts such an announcement might have. \nSee Scarlett, TR 408:14 -411:4; see also  Dobson, TR 479:6 -481:17.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 7 \nORDER 07  \n \npromot ing the best interests of Avista, its custome rs, and Hydro One’ s non -government \nshareholders.17 \nMEMORANDUM  \nI. Background and Procedural History  \n16 Avista and Hydro One filed their Joint Application for an Order Authorizing Proposed \nTransaction on September 14, 2017 . The Joint Applicants  filed simultaneously testimony \nand exhibits sponsored by seven witnesses, four of whom were Avista executive officers \nand three of whom were Hydro One executive officers. The Companies also filed their \nJoint Motion for Protective Order asking the Commissi on to enter a standard form of \nprotective order to promote discovery considering that this type of proceeding sometimes  \ncalls for the production of sensitive commercial information. The Commission entered \nOrder 01, Protective Order with “Highly Confidentia l” Provisions, on September 28, \n2017.  \n17 The Commission gave notice on September 28, 2017, that it would convene a first \nprehearing conference on October 20, 2017. During the prehearing conference, the \nCommission granted petitions to intervene by ICNU, NWIGU,  The Energy Project, \nNWEC, RNW, NRDC, and the Sierra Club.18 The Commission m emorialized these \ninterventions in Order 02, Prehearing Conference Order; Notice Of Hearing, entered on \nOctober 25, 2017. Order 02 also established a procedural schedule and set May 22, 2018, \nas the date for an evide ntiary hearing. The Commission granted intervenor status to \nWNIDCL in Order 03, on November 20, 2017.  \n18 The Commission entered Order 04  on January 25, 2018 , denying a late -filed petition to \nintervene by Lauren Fink and Chadwick Weston, two Avista shareholders. The \n                                                 \n17 We note that Hydro One’s former leadership made commitments to all investors who bought \nshares w hen the company ostensibly was privatized. Faced with political pressure driven by the \nheated rhetoric leading up to an election, the board of directors agreed to set aside express \nprotections in the Governance Agreement between H ydro One  and the province to effectuate \npromptly election promises, elevating the interests of the province over all other stakeholders. \nPromises such as are included in the settlement commitments are only as good as the willingness \nof those who made them to keep them, and defend t hem from political or other influences that \nhave nothing to do with sound business practices. We have no confidence that Hydro One will \ndefend itself, or Avista, in the face of political interference from the Province as a shareholder \nwhose will is perceiv ed by Hydro One executive leaders to be unavoidably dominant.  \n18 As previously noted, NWIGU and ICNU, since April 1, 2018, are part of a single organization, \nthe Alliance of Western Energy Consumers (AWEC). See supra  n. 13. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 8 \nORDER 07  \n \nCommission found the ir petition failed to establish good cause for being filed several \nmonths after the deadline for such a petition to be considered timely . They also  failed to \nestablish that their stated inte rests as shareholders were within the zone of interests \nidentified by the Commission’s governing authority, hence failing to demonstrate that \nthey had a substantial interest in this proceeding.  \n19 Commission Staff filed a motion on March 12, 2018, to amend t he procedural schedule. \nStaff’s motion asked the Commission to extend the deadlines for Response and Rebuttal \ntestimonies, discovery, and the date for submitting Cross -Examination Exhibits, Witness \nLists, and Time Estimates for Cross -Examination. Staff’s m otion stated that all the parties \nsupported the motion because they were actively engaged in settlement negotiations and \nthe availability of additional time for discussion would support the dispute resolution \nprocess. The Commission granted Staff’s motion in Order 05, entered on March 12, \n2018.  \n20 Staff, by letter to the Executive Secretary dated March 16, 2018, informed the \nCommission that the parties had achieved a settlement in principle. Avista filed a \nSettlement Stipulation on behalf of all parties on Ma rch 27, 2018, that would resolve all \nissues in this proceeding , if approved, and filed a motion asking the Commission to enter \nan Order Approving Settlement Stipulation and Agreement. The Commission suspended \nthe procedural schedule by notice given on Marc h 28, 2018, preserving only the \npreviously noticed hearing date, May 22, 2018, for purposes of a settlement hearing, and \nthe dates for public comment hearings in Avista’s service territory on April 23, April 24, \nMay 2, and May 3, 2018, in Spokane, Colville , Othello, and Colfax, Washington, \nrespectively.   \n21 Avista filed on May 7, 2018, on behalf of all parties , the First Amendment to Settlement \nStipulation and Agreement  to reflect Order 07, the Commission’s final order in Avista’s \ngeneral rate case at Dockets UE-170485 and UG -170486.19 Specifically, the Parties \nagreed to amend Commitment 76  to the Stipulation to reduce the amount of deferred \nfederal income tax benefit from $16.7 million to $10.4 million to be used for purposes of \naccelerating the depreciation of  Colstrip Units 3 and 4 to reflect a “useful life” of 2027 \nfor depreciation purposes.20  \n                                                 \n19 WUTC v. Avista Corporation d/b/ a Avista Utilities, et al. , Dockets UE -170485 and UG -170486 \n(consolidated), Order 07 (April 26, 2018).  \n20 This Order rejects the Settlement Stipulation as a proposed resolution of the issues in this \nproceeding. It accordingly will be necessary to revisit th e question of how to treat the “ continued \ndeferral of the unprotected excess deferred income taxes of approximately $10.4 million ” that \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 9 \nORDER 07  \n \n22 The Commission convened its evidentiary hearing  concerning the transaction and the \nproposed Settlement Stipulation  on May 22, 2018, as previously scheduled. This \nprovided an opportunity for the Commission to develop a record including pre -filed \ntestimonies and exhibits, and allowed the Commissioners an opportunity to question \nwitnesses about the settlement and, more broadly, the proposed transaction. The \nCommission  initiated its deliberations shortly after the hearing.  \n23 While the Commission was engaged in deliberations, the Province of Ontario held its \nelections on June 7, 2018. Following the elections, and the assumption of power by a new \nmajority  on June 29,  2018,  the Commission learned from media  reports on July 11, 2018, \nof the immediate re tirement  of Hydro One’s Chief Executive Officer, Mayo Schmidt, and \nof the subsequent resignations of the entire Hydro One board of directors. It was not \nimmediately clear how t hese sudden and unexpected developments m ight bear on the \nCommission’s  ongoing consideration of the proposed transaction. The Commission \nanticipate d, however, that additional process w ould be required to develop a record \nconcerning how these changes in exe cutive management and the board of directors at \nHydro One  should be considered in weighing the merits of the proposed transaction . The \nCommission gave notice on July 12, 2018, of its intention to conduct additional process \nand required Hydro One and Avista  to file comments, including any recommendations \nthey might have with respect to what specific process should be conducted.21 \n24 Avista and Hydro One filed joint comments in response to the Commission’s notice.22 \nStaff, Public Counsel, and The Energy Project ea ch filed comments. These parties \n                                                 \nwas left  for resolution in Docket U -170970 “utilizing the accounting petitions  [in Dockets UE -\n171221 and UG -171222]” that were  consolidated with Dockets UE-170485 and UG -170486 \n(consolidated) , Avista’s most recent general rate case. See id.  ¶ 22. In this Order, we direct Avista \nto work cooperatively with Commission Staff and any int erested parties to determine how best to \nbring this matter before the Commission for further consideration within 60 days after the date of \nthis Order.  \n21 Other parties were invited to file such comments, if they elected to do so.  \n22 Their comments included a proposed  amendment to Commitment 2 with the stated purpose of \nproviding additional protection to Avista’s employees, as follows:  \nAvista Employee Compensation: Any decisions regarding Avista employee \ncompensation shall be made by the Avista Board consiste nt with the terms of the \nMerger Agreement between Hydro One and Avista, and current market standards \nand prevailing practices of relevant U.S. electric and gas utility benchmarks. The \ndetermination of the level of any compensation (including equity awards)  \napproved by the Avista Board with respect to any employee in accordance with \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 10 \nORDER 07  \n \nobserved, among other things, that Hydro One ha d committed to completing the \ntransition process to a new board of directors by August 15, 2018. This would fall one \nday after the statutory deadline for a Commission order in this proceeding, unless the \nCommission gave notice of cause for an extension of as much as four months beyond that \ndate, as authorized by RCW 80.12.030(2). Considering that Hydro One’s as yet \nunannounced new board members would be responsible for appointin g a new CEO at \nHydro One on or after August 15, 2018 , and that other uncertainties would continue to be \npresent after August 14, 2018, the Commission found it necessary to invoke the “for \ncause” provision of RCW 80.12.030(2) and gave notice that  it would  extend the time \nallowed for it to enter an order in this proceeding until December 14, 2018. 23 \n25 The parties discussed among themselves and subsequently communicated to the \nCommission their proposed additional process and a schedule for the conduct of such \nprocess.  The Commission,  on August 3, 2018,  issued its Notice of Procedural Schedule \nfor the Conduct of Additional Process, including a hearing date of October 23, 2018. The \nCommission gave notice that it was reopening the record to receive additional evid ence \nfrom the parties and additional written comments from members of the public.  \n26 Avista and Hydro One filed supplemental testimony on September 6, 2018, sponsored by \ntwo Avista executives and three  Hydro One executives, the new Chairman of the Hydro \nOne Board of Directors, and one outside consultant.24 Staff and a number of the \n                                                 \nthe foregoing shall not be subject to change  by Hydro One or the Hydro One \nBoard.  \n23 The Commission’s Notice noted that:  \nAvista and Hydro One state in their comments that Hydro On e and Avista also \nacknowledge that:  \nGiven recent events in Ontario, additional time may be necessary to \nunderstand the implications of those events to Avista. We also \nacknowledge that additional, or modified commitments related to \nAvista  governance may be necessary to alleviate any lingering \nconcerns that the province of Ontario could affect Avista and its \noperations. We remain open to addressing those concerns in a \nmanner that satisfies your and our needs.  \nStaff, Public Counsel, and The  Energy Project agree that the record would benefit \nfrom such additional time and process as the Commission deems appropriate and \nrequired to understand fully the implications of these “events in Ontario.” Public \nCounsel proposes specific process options i ncluding further testimony from the \nJoint Applicants, response testimony, and further hearings.   \n24 Mr. Morris, Avista’s CEO and Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Theis, Avista’s Senior Vice \nPresident, Chief Financial Officer , and Treasurer  filed testimony for  their company. Hydro One \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 11 \nORDER 07  \n \nIntervenors filed response testimony on October 4, 2018.25 Following an email exchange  \nwith the Presiding Administrative Law Judge  concerning process matters , Avista and \nHydro One ele cted not to file rebuttal testimony. The Commission convened a hearing on \nOctober 23, 2018, which was conducted principally by the three Commissioners, to \nreceive the evidence and to allow for examination of the witnesses by the presiding \nofficers.  \nII. Standar ds for Approval  \n27 RCW 80.12.020 provides that the Commission “shall not approve any transaction under \nthis section that would result in a person, directly or indirectly, acquiring a controlling \ninterest in a gas or electrical company without a finding that t he transaction would \nprovide a net benefit to the customers of the company.” The requirement that a \njurisdictional transfer of property by an electrical or natural gas company must be found \nto provide a net benefit to the customers of the company was added  to the statute by the \nlegislature in 2009. This followed in the wake of the Commission’s order approving the \nacquisition of the largest jurisdictional utility in Washington, Puget Sound Energy  (PSE) , \nby a private investor consortium led by the Macquarie Infrastructure Partners , based in \nAustralia.26 \n28 In addition, RCW 80.01.040(3) requires the Commission to “[r]egulate in the public \ninterest,” and WAC 480 -143-170 reiterates this requirement, as pertinent here, providing \nthat: \nApplication in the Public Interest – If, upon the examination of any \napplication and accompanying exhibits, or upon a hearing concerning the \n                                                 \nfiled testimony by its acting CEO, Mr. Dobson, its newly appointed CFO, Mr. Lopez, and its \nExecutive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer , Mr. Scarlett. Mr. Woods, the newly appointed \nChairman of Hydro One’s Board of Directors a lso filed testimony. Finally for Hydro One, Mr. \nReed, Concentric Energy Advisors, filed testimony as an industry expert.  \n25 Mr. McGuire, Assistant Director of Energy Regulation, testified for the Commission. Ms. \nGerlitz on behalf of NWEC, et al., Mr. Woolri dge on behalf of Public Counsel, Mr. Hellman on \nbehalf of AWEC, and Mr. Collins on behalf of The Energy Project each filed testimony. Sierra \nClub and WNIDCL filed letters in lieu of supplemental testimony.  \n26 In the Matter of the Joint Application of Puget Holdings LLC and Puget Sound Energy, Inc. for \nan Order Authorizing Proposed Transaction , Docket U -072375, Order 08, ¶ 115 (Dec. 30, 2008) \n(PSE/Macquarie Order). Additional significant members of the consortium were  pension \nmanagement firms  located in Canad a.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 12 \nORDER 07  \n \nsame, the commission finds the proposed transaction is not consistent with \nthe public interest, it shall deny the a pplication.  \n29 Before the change in law in 2009, the case law that had developed over time construed \nthe standard for Commission approval of a transfer of property under RCW 80.12.020 as \nbeing “no harm.” This standard required that ratepayers be, at worst, indifferent  to a \nproposed transfer of property. In contrast, the net benefit standard requires that the \ntransfer of property leave ratepayers better off  as a result. The Commission distinguished \nbetween the two standards even before the legislature changed  the standard. In its Final \nOrder approving the PSE/Macquarie transaction, the Commission said: “To be \n‘consistent with the public interest,’ a transaction need not confer net benefits on \ncustomers or the public by making them better off than they would be  absent the \ntransaction. It is sufficient if the transaction causes no harm.”27 \n30 There arguably is a fine line between “no harm” and “net benefit” but, similar to other \nstandards that the Commission has long experience applying, we recognize in practice \nthat a determination of whether these standards are met is an exercise in informed \njudgment  in individual cases . We agree with Staff witness Mr. Hancock that “[b]enefits \ncan be tangible or intangible; 28 they can be financial or non -financial.”29 There is no \nsimple quantitative or qualitative test that can be meaningfully applied across all \ncircumstances.  \n31 The Commission recognized this in its first application of the net benefit standard \nfollowing the amendment of RCW 80.12.020.30 In approving the corporate reorg anization \nof Northwest Natural Gas Company  (NW Natural) , the Commission applied the net \nbenefit standard considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. Specifically, the \nCommission viewed as beneficial the establishment of “safeguards to ensure tha t other \n                                                 \n27 PSE/Macquarie Order ¶ 115.  \n28 It follows that we do not agree with Public Counsel witness Dahl who testified that “[t]o meet \nthe current statutory requirement of net benefits, the benefits provided to customers must be \ntangible.” Dahl, Exh. CJD -1T at 3:6-7. \n29 Hancock, Exh. CSH -1T (revised) at 28:4 -7. We note that Mr. Hancock elected to leave the \nCommission’s employ to pursue another professional opportunity before the time of the \nsettlement hearing. Mr. Chris McGuire  adopted Mr. Hancock’s testimony, wh ich was stipulated \ninto the record without objection.  \n30 See In the Matter of Northwest Natural Gas Company’s Application for Approval of Corporate \nReorganization to Create a Holding Company , Docket UG -170094, Order 01, ¶ 14 (Dec. 28, \n2017).  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 13 \nORDER 07  \n \naffiliates will not harm the utility’s capital structure, credit ratings, or cost of capital.”31 \nThe Commission agreed, in addition, that “reorganization will better insulate NW \nNatural’s utility assets, thereby reducing the risk that such assets co uld be reached by \ncreditors of the non -regulated affiliates.”32  \n32 Beyond this, the Commission expressly identified a “net benefit” to the Company’s \ncustomers  because the new corporate structure would “allow the Company to better \nrespond to the changing busin ess environment of the natural gas industry.” Finally, the \nCommission focused on N W Natural’s commitment to provide for three years an annual \n$55,000 credit to customers on an equal percent margin basis concurrent with the \nCompany’s purchased gas adjustmen t, as a quantitative measure of a benefit that went \n“beyond a ‘no harm’ standard [and would] result in net benefits to customers.”33  \n33 Importantly, the Commission recognized broadly that its “‘net benefit’ finding was based \non the particular facts and circum stances of NW Natural’s reorganization request and the \nnegotiated commitments.”34 Moreover, the Commission stated that: “Our decision today \ndoes not provide specific guidance for future transactions under RCW 80.12.020.”35 In \nother words, the Commission reco gnized that such determinations are by their nature fact \nspecific and must be decided on a case -by-case basis.  A corporate reorganization, for \nexample, might be found to require something  significantly  less in terms of affirmative \nbenefits than in the case  of an inherently more risky  proposed complete transfer of \nownership  to a third party . \n34 Several witnesses , in addition to Mr. Hancock for Staff , discuss ed their perspectives on \nthe meaning and application of the net benefit standard.36 In general, they share d the view \nthat the Commission should consider both sides of the test: the protective measures \nproposed to reduce the risk that a jurisdictional transaction might do harm to customers \nand the affirmative benefits offered by the transaction. As expressed co gently by Mr. \nDahl for Public Counsel: “Put simply, a transaction must first do no harm before it can \n                                                 \n31 Id. ¶ 11.  \n32 Id. ¶ 12.  \n33 Id. ¶ 13.  \n34 Id. ¶ 14.  \n35 Id. \n36 See generally  Dahl, Exh.

CSH -1T (revised) at 26:6 -30:7.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 14 \nORDER 07  \n \nprovide benefits.”37 Strong and comprehensive protective measures coupled with \ndemonstrable benefits to customers weigh in favor of Commission approval. If  protective \nmatters are found to be inadequate to protect against an unavoidable risk, the level of \naffirmative benefits to customers would need to be adequate first to offset fully the \npotential impacts if the risk is realized and, second, to make custome rs better off than \nthey would be without the transaction in order for the Commission to find net benefits.  \nIII. Discussion and Decisions  \n35 Hydro One’s proposal to acquire Avista  is in many respects quite similar to other \ntransactions the Commission has reviewed since 1999.38 Most similar  here was the \nMacquarie Group’s acquisition of PSE at the end of 2008.39 Hydro One’s  proposed \nacquisition of Avista , as in the  case of  the Macquari e consortium ’s acquisition of PSE , \nwould result in a full transfer of ownership to shareholders that reside outside the United \nStates.  As in the case of PSE, Avista would no longer be a publicly traded company if the \ntransaction is approved and consummated . Both cases met with substantial public \nopposition , among other reasons,  because they involve transfers of control to foreign \nowners . This was strongly evident  in the public comments the Commission received and \nmade part of the records in the respective p roceedings.40  \n                                                 \n37 Dahl, Exh. CJD -1T at 5:5 -6. \n38 See, e.g. , In the Matter of the Application of P acifiCorp and ScottishPower PLC for an Order \n(1) Disclaiming Jurisdiction or, in the Alternative, Authorizing the Acquisition of Control of \nPacifiCorp by ScottishPower and (2) Affirming Compliance with RCW 80.08.040 for \nPacifiCorp's Issuance of Stock in Co nnection with the Transaction , Docket No. UE -981627, \nSecond Supp. Order at 2 (March 16, 1999) ; In the Matter of the Joint Application of \nMidAmerican Energy Holdings Company and PacifiCorp, d/b/a Pacific Power & Light Company \nfor an Order Authorizing Propos ed Transaction,  Docket UE-051090 (filed July 15, 2005); In the \nmatter of the Joint Application of MDU Resources Group, Inc. and Cascade Natural Gas \nCorporation for an Order Authorizing Proposed Transaction , Docket UG -061721, Order 06 ¶ 9 \n(June 27, 2007).  \n39 PSE/Macquarie Order ¶¶165 -174. \n40 The Commission received 448 public comments in this proceeding through the close of the \nrecord on October 23, 2018, including 365 comments opposing the merger, 13 comments \nsupporting the merger, and 70 comments that took n o position.  See PSE/Macquarie Order ¶ 5 \n(case “ distinguished by the fact that there is substantial public opposition to the transaction \nevident from the considerable volume of written public comments, and the high attendance and \npredominant testimony in th e four public comment hearings the Commission conducted \nthroughout PSE’s service territory. ”). \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 15 \nORDER 07  \n \n36 The Commission resolved PSE/Macquarie on the basis of a Settlement Stipulation that \nincluded 63 commitments by the Joint Applicants, which were identified in testimony \nsupporting the settlement . These commitments addressed  nine basic categories: capital \nrequirements; financial integrity; regulatory and ring -fencing; staffing, management , and \ngovernance; local presence; rates; quality of service; low -income assistance; and \nenvironmental, renewable energy, and energy efficien cy. The Commission approved the \nSettlement Stipulation , adding 15 significant, multi -part conditions and clarifications.41 \nAvista and Hydro One propose to resolve this proceeding with a similar Settlement \nStipulation that includes, following amendment, 82 commitments  reflecting these same \nbasic categories.  These were tailored to facts and circumstances peculiar to the Joint \nApplicants  in this case . \n37 Three principal factors , however,  distinguish this case from PSE/Macquarie and other \nsimilar transactions previ ously approved  by the Commission . First, at the time of our \ninitial hearing in this case  on May 22, 2018 , all parties supported the Settlement \nStipulation and its commitments as satisfying their interests collectively and individually, \nand argued the trans action would provide  a net benefit to customers and be in the public \ninterest. The parties all “[agreed] to support this Stipulation as a settlement of all issues in \nthis proceeding and to recommend approval of the Proposed Transaction in this \nproceeding s ubject to the agreed -upon commitments .”42 Moreover, they agreed “to \nsupport the Stipulation throughout this proceeding.”43 These obligations became effective \non March 27, 2018, and remained effective at the time the hearing record was closed on \nOctober 23, 2 018.44  \n38 In contrast  to the uniform support of the Settlement Stipulation in this case , Public \nCounsel opposed Commission approval of the PSE/Macquarie transaction arguing, \namong other things, that its proponents were required to prove there was an affirmative \nneed for the transaction (i.e., a net benefit, as now required by statute). The c ontested \nnature of the settlement in Macquarie resulted in the production of a very robust record. \n                                                 \n41 PSE/Macquarie Order, Attachment B.  \n42 Exh. JNT -1T at 5:11 -13. \n43 Exh. JNT -3 (Settlement Stipulation) ¶ 16.  \n44 Since there were no contested issues among the parties for the Commission to resolve, and all \nparties supported the Commission’s adoption of the Settlement Stipulation in full resolution of \nthe case, we determined that briefs, requested by Joint Applicant s at the conclusion of the \nOctober 23, 2018, hearing, would add nothing useful to the record.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 16 \nORDER 07  \n \nThere was a thorough presentation by the parties of evidence and arguments on both sides \nof the issues.45  \n39 Second, following approval of Macquarie ’s acquisiti on of PSE in late December 2008, \nthe Washington legislature, in 2009, expressly added to RCW 80.12.020 the “net benefit \nto customers” standard  for transactions that involve the transfer of a controlling interest \nin a jurisdictional gas or electrical compan y. The PSE/Macquarie merger, in contrast, was \nsubject statutorily to a “no harm” standard. This case represents the first time the \nCommission has considered this type of transaction under the net benefit standard.   \n40 Third, as emphasized by  the post -election  events  in Ontario, Canada  discussed  above, it is \nimportant to consider carefully the different nature of the acquiring investors  when \nevaluating the merits of this transaction . The Macquarie consortium  was made up \nexclusively of long -established , private ly held equity management companies based in \nAustralia and Canada. The acquiring companies all had significant experience in \nmanaging infrastructure investments. All members of the Macquarie consortium were \nprivate business people whose decisions necessari ly would be driven fundamentally, if \nnot exclusively, by commercial considerations of what would be in the best interests of \nthe utility they wished to acquire. Their individual success would be measured by the \nsuccess of the business investment they propo sed to make, as evaluated by analysts in the \nfinancial credit and equity markets, results measured by share valuation and sound \ndividend policies, and success in delivering safe and reliable service to customers at \nreasonable rates objectively determined b y an experienced regulatory authority.  \n41 In this case , the acquiring investor  is Hydro One. Hydro One was a Crown Corporation, \nwholly owned by the Canadian Province of Ontario until November 2015. Three years \nago, under different leadership , the province beg an the process of privatiz ing Hydro One. \nThe privatization process had been under way less than two years when Hydro One and \nAvista filed their merger application in September 2017. The province had sold off \napproximately 53 percent of its ownership intere st by December 2017. Despite Hydro \nOne’s relatively short experience as an investor -owned company, its CEO, Mr. Schmidt , \ntestified that “Hydro One is well prepared to manage a company under the pressure of \npublic markets and meeting investor expectations.”46 He explained that part of the plan in \ntransforming  Hydro One into a public ly traded company  was to strengthen the company’s \nexecutive leadership . He testified further that the company “has attracted highly qualified \n                                                 \n45 The contested nature of the case made briefs appropriate and these were filed on September 23 \nand 24, 2008.  \n46 Schmidt, Exh. MMS -4T at 11:10 -11. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 17 \nORDER 07  \n \nand skilled directors and senior execu tives with decades of experience with public \ncompany compliance.”47 \n42 The Province  of Ontario , as a legacy shareholder  of this former Crown Corporation , now \nowns 47 percent of Hydro One’s stock . Given this,  the province’s plans as a major \nshareholder/ owner of Hydro One and Avista, and the effective  governance structure of \ntheir individual and  combined companies , are highly relevant and important to our \nevaluation of the merits of the proposed transaction.48 Throughout this proceeding, we \nreceived  repeat ed assurances  from Hydro One’s witnesses that despite the province’s \nlarge ownership share, Hydro One is a private , publicly  traded  corporation, fully in \ncharge of its own affairs with the direction of an independent board of directors. We \nreceived  assuran ces that the Province of Ontario would not interfere in the direction and \nmanagement of Hydro One. We were told that the province had  “been exemplary in their \nbehavior in not involving themselves in the business of the organization .” \n43 Since June of this yea r, however, the province has been anything but exemplary in its \nbehavior, involving itself in direct and substantial ways in Hydro One’s business. Now , \nas result of  a change in the majority controlling the provincial government in Ontario, the \ndirectors ha ve all been replaced with individuals not previously involved in Hydro One’s \naffairs and they are yet to determine who will take the executive leadership helm as CEO. \nMoreover, the provincial government has expressed through its leader the belief that \nHydr o One is not a private corporation.49 It no longer is clear that Hydro One can be \nregarded as a private, publicly  traded  corporation . While not legally a Crown \nCorporation, Hydro One manifestly is subject to being controlled by the province’s  \nlegislative power . In addition, while the province does not own a controlling interest in \nHydro One, a compliant Board o f Directors and CEO, in this instance, avoided this \ninconvenient fact by agreeing with the province under Section 8.11 of the Governanc e \nAgreement to waive provisions in the agreement meant to protect the rights of other \nshareholders owning 53 percent of the company .50 It appears that Hydro One’s corporate \nidentity as a private, publicly  traded  corporation depends significant ly on the iden tity of \nthe ruling party in Ontario, or even on the leadership of that party. In important re spect s \nwe perceive  Hydro One today , in light of the full record,  to be a different entity than the \n                                                 \n47 Schmidt, Exh.

Yet now, on \nthe other hand, we are evaluating the Settlement Stipula tion at a time when the identity of \nHydro One as a private, publicly  traded  corporation is uncertain and has already been \ndemonstrably lost to some extent. Moreover, we find Hydro One today with a completely \ndifferent board of directors than the one  in place at the time of our Settlement Hearing on \nMay 22, 2018, and an acting CEO whose replacement has yet to be identified.  \n45 We agree with the parties that the  Settlement commitments collectively present state of \nthe art ring fencing and other provision s that, to the extent they are allowed to function as \nwritten, would provide significant protections to Avista with respect to the specific \nsubject matters they cover. These include financial protections, provisions meant to \npreserve Avista’s independence in terms of governance and strategic planning, and \npreservation of Avista’s local presence in Spokane and other communities the company \nserves. Were these detailed matters all we had to be concerned about, our record could be \nseen as supportive in terms of  risk mitigation. Point -by-point mitigation of individual \nrisks, however, is n either  the first, nor the  only, relevant level of analysis  given the facts \nof this case . As the familiar metaphor  cautions, we must not miss the forest for the trees. \nWe must con sider at a high level the suitability of Hydro One as a potential new owner \nfor Avista  in light of everything we know today . \n46 We focus our discussion below at this higher level, finding the relevant facts  discussed \nthere  dispositive.  We find no particular  need to discuss the individual Settlement \ncommitments because the evidence in this proceeding undermines  our ability to trust that \nthe provincial government in Ontario will not interfere in the business of Hydro One in \nways that undercut these commitments.51 Hydro One cannot make commitments that bind \nthe province and the province has not been at the negotiating table. Considering events \nthat already have transpired, w e cannot trust that the province will not take additional \naction s without regard to the harmful consequences  they may have  for Hydro One and \n                                                 \n51 We note that the province  is not a party to the  merger agreement or the  Settlement Stipulation . \nIt had no role in negotiating either agreement  and it has not publicly endorsed the proposed \ntransaction  or the Settlement Stipulation.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 19 \nORDER 07  \n \nAvista.52 This would be a continuing risk that no provision in a settlement agreement \nbetween Hydro One and Avista can adequately protect against.  We discuss these points \nand the evidence concerning them in some detail below.  \nA. Risks of t he Proposed Transaction  \n47 The parties  in this proceeding filed joint and individual testimonies and exhibits on April \n10, 2018 , advocating approval of the  proposed  transaction , as they expressly committed \nto do in the Se ttlement Stipulation .53 In his testimony, Hydro One CEO Mayo Schmidt \nacknowledged that in some jurisdictions with regulatory approval authority over the \nproposed transaction , parties had expressed concerns about the Province of Ontario’s role \nas Hydro One’s  largest shareholder and thus  its post -merger control over Avista.54 Mr. \nSchmidt said these concerns were not “valid” because : “The Province’s role is limited to \nbeing Hydro One’s largest shareholder, and the Governance Agreement between Hydro \nOne and the Province of Ontario establishes this role for the Province.”55 He described \nthe Governance Agreement in the following terms:  \n[It] is  a binding contract that was a pre -requisite for Hydro One’s \nsuccessful Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). It establishes the  Province’s \nrole as a shareholder —a role separate and distinct from Hydro One’s \nbusiness  activities —and ensures that Hydro One  will operate like any \nother investor -owned utility.  Under the Governance Agreement, the Hydro \nOne board of directors (the  “Board”) is responsible for the management \nof, or supervising the management of, Hydro  One’s business and affairs. \n(Governance Agreem ent (“GA”) 2.1.2). The Governance  Agreement states \nthat the Province will be involved in Hydro One as an investor and not  as \na manager. (GA 2.1.3). The Province does not have a role with the Hydro \nOne Board  in the processes of appointment, removal, replace ment, and \ncompensation relating to  executive officers or over related succession \nplanning. Hydro One neither takes direction  nor seeks consent for its \n                                                 \n52 As we discuss below, actions taken by the province following the Ontario election on June 7, \n2018, caused substantial harm to both companies, causing the value of Avista’s shares to drop 4.5 \npercent and the value of  Hydro One’s shares to drop as much as 8 percent in a single day . Morris, \nTR 364:17 -365:1; 369:7 -19. The province’s careless disregard for the harm done by taking \npolitically motivated action to remove the  Hydro One board and CEO is illustrated powerfully by \nthe fact that the value of the province’s own Hydro One shares dropped by hundreds of millions \nof dollars.

(GA 2.1.3; 2.2).56 \n48 Mr. Schmidt testified briefly concerning the Province’s “rights and limitations as a \nshareholder,” as defined by the Governance Agreement , and offered the reassurance that \nthe Pro vince would not “control Avista post -merger.”57 He mentioned that the agreement \ncould be terminated by mutual agreement of Hydro One and the province .58 He did not \npoint out, however, that these parties also could waive any provision of the agreement or \nany breach of the agreement if they memorialized any such waiver in writing.59 This \nwaiver ability  became significantly relevant vis -à-vis the testimony  quoted  above and Mr. \nSchmidt’s  follow -on testimony that, despite the province  being Hydro One’s largest \nshareholder:  \nHydro One is not any more vulnerable to political change than any  other \ninvestor -owned utility in Canada, or the United States for that matter, \nbecause of  the Governance Agreement between Hydro One and the \nProvince. As explained above,  the Governance Agreement establishes that \nthe Province cannot interfere in the  management or operations of Hydro \nOne. The only influence it conceivably has is  through the selection of 40% \nof the Hydro One board members. However, those b oard members must \nbe independent of both the Province and Hydro One, and they must meet  \nthe high qualification standards set by Hydro One’s Nominating and \nGovernance  Committee. As a result, Hydro One is no more subject to the \ninfluence of the Province’s  politicians than any other investor -owned \nutility is subject to the political influence of  elected and appointed officials \nin the jurisdiction in which it operates.60 \n49 The reassurances Mr. Schmidt offered in his testimony may have been given  sincerely at \nthe time it was filed  but they turned out to be materially incorrect , as w e discuss below . \nFirst, however, some additional context is required.  \n50 During late April and early May we heard a considerable number of public comment s \nduring four hearings in separate lo cations in Avista’s service territory, and received \n                                                 \n56 Id. at 8:10-9:3.

The Commission was aware, as well, that \nHydro One ’s move  toward privatization remained  controversial in Ontario and was a \nhighly visible issue leading up to the province’s June 2018 elections in which three \npolitical parties vied for majority control and control of the opposition party.62  \n51 Specifically, the party  in the majority in Ontario’s  government for four terms beginning \nin 2003 remained committed to its original goal of putting 60 percent of Hydro One into \nprivate hands, while planning that the province would retain a 40 perc ent interest as a \nshareholder. The province owned a 47 percen t share of Hydro One at the time the Joint \nApplication under consideration in this docket  was filed  and would continue to have that \nlevel of ownership interest  at the time of the election. If Hydro One completed its \nproposed acquisition of Avista, the prov ince’s ownership share would be diluted to \napproximately 42 percent.  \n52 In campaigning for the June 2018 elections, the Progressive Conservative Party candidate  \nwas running  on a platform that included prominently a threat to fire Hydro One’s CEO \nand to replac e its board of directors. The party also committed to a 12 percent reduction \nin Hydro One’s rates on top of a 25 percent reduction already in place following \nprivatization. These were central themes in campaign speeches  and other public \nstatements.  \n53 The Ont ario New Democratic Party (NDC) proposed  to return Hydro One to public \nownership . The NDC also  committed to a 30 percent reduction in rates and to bringing \ntime-of-use pricing to an end.  \n54 With reference to these matters during the Settlement Hearing on May  22, 2018, \nCommissioner Rendahl asked Mr. Schmidt to address the “issue of concern about foreign \nownership  [a]nd the role of the Province, which was addressed in the public hearings as \nwell, in terms of having significant ownership of the company and how t hat could play \nout, especially with the potential change in the political landscape.”63 Mr. Schmidt \ntestified that the starting point for his response was the Governance Agreement.64 \nConsistent with his prefiled testimony on this subject, he said that:  \n                                                 \n61 By the end of the hearing proceedings, the Commission received 365 comments opposing the \nmerger, 13 comments supporting the merger, and 70 comments that took no position.  \n62 See TR 312:23 -327:15.  \n63 TR 308:13 -14. \n64 Schmidt, TR 309:14 -15. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 22 \nORDER 07  \n \nThe governance agreement structurally is that the  Province and the \ncompany have a contract. And that  contract is that the shareholder -- \nwhich, of course, in  this case is a Province -- is a shareholder and is not a  \nmanager of the business.65 \nHe testified in add ition that:  \n[T]he Province has been  exemplary in their behavior in not involving \nthemselves  in the business of the organization and, quite frankly,  has \nfound the work of the organization to be, simply  put, outstanding.66 \n55 Commissioner Balasbas followed up wi th reference to the then impending election in the \nProvince of Ontario  and the need to consider the possible outcomes. In response, Mr. \nSchmidt described  the diverse platforms of the principle parties concerning their \nrespective visions about the future of  Hydro One , as discussed above. Commissioner \nBalasbas asked in addition about provision  8.4 in the Governance Agreement that \nprovides for termination of the agreement by mutual consent. Mr. Schmidt responded, \nhowever, with reference to section 4.7 of the G overnance Agreement , which established a \ndetailed process by which the province could seek to remove and replace the board of \ndirectors, but not the CEO.67  \n56 Chairman Danner, in turn, followed up on this colloquy, observing that it was important \nto “get a ha ndle on what kind of volatility, if any, we ’re stepping into” because, as had \nbeen reported  in the financial press “investors [should] pay attention because ‘policy \nshifts and promises of retribution could impact the stock of the company.’”68 He \nidentified specifically concerns about section 4.7 of the Governance Agreement and \nstated that its terms “[sound] to me like the Province still has  potential to have large sway \nover the policies and  direction of the company. ”69  \n57 Mr. Schmidt testified that he was well familiar with section 4.7. Without describing the \nprocess established by section 4.7 for removal of the board, Mr. Schmidt offered several \nreassurances, testifying that:  \nThe board of directors currently today, of course,  is fully independent of \nthe Province and they act  commercially. And as I mentioned, the Province \n                                                 \n65 Schmidt, TR 3 10:2-6. \n66 Schmidt, TR 310: 13-18. \n67 Schmidt, TR  315:19 -25. \n68 TR 315:17 -21. \n69 TR 316:1 -13. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 23 \nORDER 07  \n \nhas not  weighed in on any matters associated with the commercial  \noperations of the organization.  \nSecondly, to your reading, is that should the  Province determine that they \nwant to change the board of  directors − and in fact the early design was to \nnot be  in a position for a  [sic] Province to change a few or certain  \nmembers of the board because they might be more  commercially or \nindependent from the Province, is that  it would have a higher bar to \nchange the entire board  and yet an even higher bar to bring back another \nyet fully independent board of directors who has no  connectivity with the \nprovincial government. So  therefore it ’s a net zero -sum gain of not gaining \nany particular influence o ver the commercial operations of  the \norganization, and all through that being that we  have a contract with the \nProvince that they in fact will  operate as a shareholder but not a manager \nof the  business.  \nSo structurally, they can remove the full board of  directors, not the CEO. \nThen they would be compelled to  vote for another fully independent board \nof directors  and, again, not having the ability to terminate the CEO,  who \nwould be running the commercial operations of the  business. If that ’s \nhelpful.70 \n58 Followi ng additional colloquy between Mr. Schmidt and the bench, Chairman Danner \nsaid he wished to understand at a high level the risks associated with the province ’s large \nownership share in Hydro One. He asked: “ Is there a  scenario under which the Province \ncould undo the  privatization of Hydro One, or is there a scenario by  which the Province \ncould gain control of the company  going forward? ”71 Mr. Schmidt responded that:  \nWe would view it clearly as they have a contract and  that that contract \nbetween the two parties, as earlier  mentioned, would need the participation \nof both parties.  Short of the province with a majority simply saying for  \nwhatever purpose we are going to go through the effort  of changing the \nlaw and in fact affecting that contract,  which, you know, of course, goes to \nany other commercial  organization doing business in the Province \nthinking can  the contract be set aside. And it would be our view  that that \n                                                 \n70 Schmidt, TR 316:20 -317:21.  \n71 TR 321:21 -322:1.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 24 \nORDER 07  \n \nwould not be the outcome. And I could let our  counsel  [Mr. Scarlett]  \nspeak to it in greater  depth if you would like,  Commissioner.72 \n59 Responding to the question Chairman Danner had just posed to Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Scarlett \ntestified:  \nThe simple answer is:  Absent a government passing new legislation to \nundo a  lot of what ’s being done, the short answe r is no. We  have a \ncontract with the government, the governance  agreement . . . with the \nProvince of Ontario. It ’s a binding contract.  [The] Province of Ontario \nrespects its contracts, and if they tried to breach the contract we can go to \ncourt . But I  don’t expect any of that to happen.  \nThe contract is very intentionally and carefully  crafted to control the \npower of a major shareholder. So  right now they have 47 -odd percent. It \nwill be diluted  to 42 -odd percent if our deal goes through. But  remember, \nthis c ontract was in place when they owned  85 percent at the time of the \nIPO. And it constrains  their ability. It constrains their ability. In a  public -\ntraded company, you don ’t have to have over  50 percent of the shares to \nvote the entire board. You  can do it q uite effectually at a much lower \nnumber.  \nWhat this agreement does is constrains the Province  of Ontario to 40 \npercent of the board. Period, full  stop. It has other language that prevents it \nfrom what  we would say in Canada as acting jointly and in concert  with \nanother party.  \nSo one of your questions was could they team up with  somebody else to \ncombine to get over 50, and I would  say, no, that ’s prevented in the \ncontract. And, B, they  really wouldn ’t have to anyway if they wanted − if \nit wasn ’t for the other  provisions in the governance  agreement.  \nI think Mr. Schmidt took you through how the change  of the board works. \nAgain, it ’s a complicated procedure  that’s meant to make it difficult for \nthe Province to  weigh in at the board. It would have to be something  \ndramatic, and even then the new board itself would have  to be at the same \nstandard of independence as the board  that currently sits.73 \n                                                 \n72 Schmidt, TR 322:8 -19.  \n73 Scarlett, TR 323:18 -325:6 (emphasis added). We note in this connection that t he province’s \nrespe ct for its contracts may not be as strong  as what Mr. Scarlett believe d. Under the omnibus \nbill of which the Hydro One Accountability Act is one part, or “schedule,” the province has \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 25 \nORDER 07  \n \n60 Returning specifically to provision 4.7 of the Governance Agreement, Mr. Scarlett \ntestified in addition that:  \n[I]t’s proba bly a 90 -day process because they file a removal notice. That \ntriggers the need for a shareholders ’ meeting, which you can do under our \ncorporate law.  And that then triggers the need to set up an ad hoc \nnominating committee, which would then go out under t he direction of our \nchair. Whether he or she is replaced or not, they are in charge of the ad \nhoc nominating committee. They line up representatives from our five \nbiggest shareholders. . . . And they create a new slate.  \nAnd then there is a shareholders ’ meeting and they vote on the slate. Now, \nof course, then they would be having the votes, and even then, they only \nget their 40 percent. They don ’t get to vote the whole kit and caboodle. \nJust the 40 percent.  \nSo it’s in a very kind of carefully thought through and structured \narrangement done intentionally because the Province was selling the deal \nto the public. And if they went out to public investors and the investors \nthought that the Province was going to be able to meddle or fiddle around \nin the busin ess of Hydro One, the view was the deal would not have been \nsuccessful, nor would they be able to assemble the management team led \nby Mayo Schmidt, because no one wanted to work for Crown Corporation, \nto be blunt.74  \n61 Despite all of this  testimony suggesting  a low probability of interference by the province \nin Hydro One’s affairs,  and the ability of Hydro One to stand up for the rights of all its \ninvestors and other stakeholders if the province did seek to interfere,  it turned  out that the \nviability of the pr otections built into the Governance Agreement  was oversold to a \nsignificant degree. Soon after t he change in majority leadership resulting from the June 7, \n2018, Ontario general election  it became  apparent that the force of the Governance \nAgreement  as an enforceable  contract  that would protect Hydro One’s independence and \nfreedom from political interference depended less on its language than on the identity of \n                                                 \ncancelled at least one major contract with third parties, the nearly comp leted  10-year, $100 \nmillion White Pines wind project. The omnibus bill, at the same time confer red upon the province \nand Hydro One immunity from civil liability in connection with any arguable breaches of \ncontract.  \n74 Scarlett, TR 325:9 -326:8.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 26 \nORDER 07  \n \nthe governing party in the province  and the willingness of the board to enforce its terms \nin court , if necessary .  \n62 Indeed, immediately upon taking power, the new majority party  involved itself deeply in \nHydro One’s business , causing CEO Schmidt to “retire” and the entire board of directors \nto resign. In doing so, Hydro One’s leadership and the new prov incial government \nleadership ag reed to waive provisions in the Governance Agreement that nominally \nprevented the province from removing the CEO and other provisions meant to provide \nprocedural safeguards in the event the province, as shareholder, wished to  replace the \nboard. Specifically, the province effectively forced CEO Schmidt to retire and the board \nof directors to resign en masse  without consulting, involving, or even informing other \nshareholders, who own a majority of Hydro One’s shares, until after  the fact. Absent the \nwaiver to which the board agreed , this violated the letter  of section 4.7  the Governance \nAgreement  that provides for notice to all shareholders and a shareholders’ meeting to \nconsider any proposal by the province to remove the board .75 Even with the waiver, this \nviolated the spirit and intent of the Governance Agreement, which was meant to reassure \ninvestors at the time Hydro One began privatization that shareholders in the publicly  \ntraded corporation would have their rights respected j ust as in the case of any other \npublicly traded corporation.76 \n63 Given the testimony we heard on May 22 , 2018, which we quote extensively above, the \ndegree of acquiescence by  the CEO and the sitting Board of Directors in carrying out the \nmajority’s political agenda was surprising and concerning . It appears from the evidence \ntaken on October 23, 2018, that neither the CEO nor the board were w illing to defend the \nintegrity of Hydro One as a publicly  traded  corporation with multiple investors . Indeed, it \nwas the CEO and the board  members  that took the initiative in waiving the prohibition \nagainst the province removing the CEO and the requirements of section 4.7 governing \n                                                 \n75 We note Mr. Scarlett’s testimony confirming that the waiver requires only  an agreement \nbetween Hydro One and a single shareholder, namely the province , and “other shareholders have \nno say in the decision whether there's going to be a waiver.” TR 418:8 -20. Having just \nacknowledged that “the intent of the Governance Agreement was to protect shareholders given  \nthe large percentage ownership of the Province ” (TR 417:23 -418) we find it incredulous that Mr. \nScarlett disputed that the waiver provision, which is n ot limited in scope, “severely undercut the \nintent of the Governance Agreement to protect shareholders.” TR 418:4 -12. \n76 See Scarlett, TR 325:24 -326:8; 413:24 -414:4.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 27 \nORDER 07  \n \nwhat Mr. Scarlett described as the “ complicated procedure that ’s meant to make it \ndifficult for the Province to weigh in at the board .”77  \n64 Finally , we are concerned that the province evinced its willingness to pass intrusive \nlegislation to effect campaign promises.78 Considering the as yet unrealized  campaign \npromise to reduce Hydro One ’s rates by 12 percent  , legislation may be forthcoming  to \neffect such a rate change, as might further  intrusive legislation addressing other issues .79  \n65 We find additional  reasons for concern  over the changes in Hydro One’s executive \nmanagement and direction  in light of the fact that it is clear  from the record  that the \npersonal involvement  by Hydro One CEO Mayo  Schmidt  with his counterpart at Avista, \nCEO Scott Morris, was central to the results achieved during the merger negotiations.80 \nNo one expected, and i t is indeed concerning, that one of the two key negotiators was \nforced by the province to “retire” and the entire board that approved the deal resigned \nunder pressure from the province before we could even complete our review of the \nproposed transaction. A t the very least, a consideration pertinent to our evaluation of the \nproposed transaction is that during the transition in Avista’s ownership contemplated \nunder the merger, Mr. Schmidt’s absence from his position as Hydro One’s CEO, and the \nabsence of any Hydro One board member with first -hand knowledge of the negotiations, \nwill lead to greater uncertainty for Avista and its customers as the company is, \neffectively, acquired by a nother  company whose leadership is unknown to Avista’s \nleadership. We note furt her in this connection that for the time being Hydro One is being \nled by an acting CEO who, it appears, may be replaced by someone whose identity is not \nknown.81  \n                                                 \n77 TR 325:1 -3.

We do not disagree with later testimony making the \npoint that “ Eventually, executives retire or leave a company to pursue other opportunities ” and \ncertain governance and other commitments “ are all preserved in contractual docume nts that \ncontinue long past the tenure of any single executive involved in the negotiation of the Proposed \nTransaction. ” Exh.

Mr. \nMorris testified that:  \nAt the very outset of negotiations with Hydro One, I vividly recall a \nprivate conversation with Mayo Schmidt, the CEO of Hydro One, in \nwhich I made very clear to him that Avista needed these types of \nassurances on autonomy for us to run our business as  we see fit. Without a \nmoment of hesitation, Mr. Schmidt slid a pen across t he table and said, \nwords to the effect, “Scott, you have the drafting pen. Write it up the way \nyou want.” This ultimately r esulted in a set of conditions styled as a \nDelegation of Authority, which ultimately found their way into \nCommitments 1 -15, as furthe r revised by the Parties to the Settlement \n                                                 \n82 Morris, Exh.

In connection with the first point Mr. Morris made here we \nhad testimony from Mr. Morris and Mr. Schmidt to the effect that neither company expects much, \nif anything, in the way of synergies from their combination, at least in the near term. Beyond t hat \nthe prospect for any such benefits is vague, at best.  See Schmidt, Exh. MMS -1T at 22:11 -15; \n33:1-28; Morris, TR 270:23 -25; 273:3 -4. \n83 Morris, Exh.

Indeed, to my knowledge, this approach may be unique in the \nworld of utility mergers and acquisitions.85  \nFollowing this testimony , again emphasizing the trust that had developed between the \ntwo CEOs, Mr. Morris reiterated the point that:  \nBy selecting an acquisition partner (Hydro One) that truly understands this \nheritage of Avista, we may avoid the potential of someday being acquired \nby others who might be less appreciative of how we do business.86  \n68 We recognize in this connection that the nature and character of a publicly  held \ncorporation that is a potential merger partner are defined largely by its board of directors \nand executive management, particularly the CEO.  It is these individuals who, \ncollecti vely, determine how the corporation conducts its affairs.  The removal of Mr. \nSchmidt as Hydro One’s CEO and the forced resignation of the company’s board of \ndirectors that approved this proposed transaction means that were we to approve this \nmerger  in the wake of the fundamental, material changes on and after July 11, 2018,  it \nwould be tantamount to accepting that Avista is “being acquired by others” who might be \nless appreciative of how Avista does  business . We have no convincing  evidence , if any a t \nall, that the  new board and CEO , whose identity remains unknown,  will share the values \non which the successful negotiation of the proposed transaction depended. This is \nparticularly concerning considering that the character of Hydro One as a publicly  traded \ncorporation is seriously impaired by virtue of the province’s interference in the \ncompany’s affairs.  \n69 Mr. Schmidt and the former board shared with Avista the perspectives and values of \nexecutive management and direction guided by principles that govern the conduct of \npublicly traded  companies . Shareholder interests inform the decisions of such leadership , \nbut the respective CEOs and directors in place  at these companies  prior to July 11, 2018, \ndid not  take direction from, or allow interference in managem ent by, shareholders.  \nIndeed, a s Mr. Scarlett testified,  had there been such involvement by the province,  \n“Hydro One would not have been able to assemble the management team led by Mayo \nSchmidt, because no one wanted to work for a Crown Corporation, to be blunt.”87  \n70 Nothing in the record of this proceeding through the date of our Settlement Hearing on \nMay 22, 2018, contradicted this . Testimony from Hydro One and Avista witnesses was \n                                                 \n85 Morris, Exh. SLM -5T at 6:22 -7:8. \n86 Morris, Exh.

Our understanding  changed fundamentally , however,  as events \nunfolded on and after July 11, 2018. On that day and after, it became apparent that Hydro \nOne management and direction were , in fact,  subject to  decisions  by the Province of \nOntario just as if Hydro One remained a Crown Corporation with a contro lling, or even \nexclusive , ownership interest held  by the Province of Ontario. The Province of Ontario’s \ndirect and significant interference in the management and direction of Hydro One  \nbeginning July 11, 2018, discredits  and impugns the perhaps sincere, bu t clearly incorrect \ntestimony presented during our settlement hearing to the effect that we should  consider \nHydro One  to be a fully  independent, private  company . Thus, it is clear that Hydro One is \nnot the same company that  its former CEO and directors, an d Avista, considered it to be \nwhen Avista agreed to the proposed merge r earlier in 2018 .88 \n71 Indeed, the evidence we received during our hearing on October 23, 2018, included \ntestimony showing that the post -election process that led to the July 11, 2018 , Letter \nAgreement between Hydro One and the province was initiated by CEO Schmidt and the \nHydro One board. On July 11, 2018, the first session  of the 42nd Parliament of the \nLegislative Assembly of Ontario commenced. Mr. Lopez testified  in his supplemental \ntestimony  that the same day, Hydro One  “announced that following an approach by \nHydro One to the Province , they had entered into an agreement for the purpose of the \norderly replacement of the Hydro One and HOI boards and the retirement of Mayo \nSchmidt as t he CEO effective July 11, 2018. ”89  \n72 Expressly referring in his supplemental  testimony to the campaign promises to remove \nHydro One’s CEO and some or all members of Hydro One’s board, and to lower rates for \nOntario residents, Mr. Scarlett testified that:  \nIf Premier Ford and his Progressive Conservative Party wished to seek to \nremove some or all of Hydro One’s Board and its CEO, they could \naccomplish these  objectives either (i) through procedures established by \nSection 4.7 of the Governance Agreement …, or (ii ) through legislation.90 \nMr. Scarlett  filed this testimony on September 6, 2018, well after the events of July 11, \n2018. Yet, he does not mention here, or elsewhere in his supplemental testimony , the \n                                                 \n88 See supra  n. 75.  \n89 Lopez, Exh.

It did so by reaching agreement with Hydro One ’s board  to waive \ncertain requirements set out in Section 4.7 and arguably to breach  the agreement by \nignoring its express limitation against provincial re moval of the CEO.91 Indeed, Mr. \nScarlett testified that except for provisions “ principally limited to compensation matter s,” \nthe province, in Section 16 of the Letter Agreement, “ ratified and reaffirmed its \ncommitment to the Governance Agreement, which rema ins in full force and effect .”92 He \nquoted Section 16 in full, as follows:  \n16. Reaffirmation: By entering into this Agreement, the Province ratifies \nand reaffirms its obligations under the Governance Agreement and agrees \nthat, except as specifically set out  in this Agreement with respect to the \nsubject matter hereof, (i) the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this \nAgreement or any other  documents delivered in connection herewith shall \nnot amend, modify or operate as a waiver or forbearance of any right , \npower, obligation, remedy or provision under the Governance Agreement , \nand (ii) such agreement shall continue in full force and effect.93 \n73 Mr. Scarlett’s testimony here not only defied common sense —the Governance \nAgreement manifestly did not “remain in ful l force and effect” insofar as the July 11 \nLetter Agreement expressly waive d parts of Section 4.7 —Mr. Scarlett’s reference to \n“compensation matters” but not to matters concerning the board’s removal  that required \nsuch waivers suggests an effort to mislead us. This is particularly concerning considering \nthat the context of Mr. Scarlett’s testimony was the means by which the province could \nremove the board including “ through procedures established by Section 4.7 of the \nGovernance Agreement .” Mr. Scarlett  unde rcut his credibility as a key witness in this \nproceeding by pointing to “compensation matters” as the “subject matter” for which \nSection 16 provided a general exception to the Governance Agreement  allowing for \nwaiver , without mentioning the fact that  the only “subject matter ” waived under the \nLetter Agreement  had nothing to do with compensation matters  but, rather, was more \n                                                 \n91 See Exh. MMS -5 (Governance Agreement) (Section 8.11 expressly provides that “any \nprovision or . . . any breach of any provision  of this Agreement” is effective and binding on the \nprovince and Hydro One if it meets the requirements of being “made in writing and signed by the \nparty purporting to give such waiver.”).  \n92 Scarlett, Exh.

The only waiver in the Letter Agreement  set forth \nin Section 1.c. says, in part:  \nFor greater c ertainty, the requirements to provide a  Removal Notice or call \nand hold a Removal Meeting under the Governance  Agreement are waived \nin connection with the replacement of the existing Directors  with the \nReplacement Directors in the manner contemplated under  this section 1.94 \n74 This waiver concerns exclusively express  requirements found in Section 4.7 of the \nGovernance Agreement that are part of  what Mr. Scarlett earlier described as  the \n“carefully thought through and structured arrangement”  meant to reassure in vestors as \nHydro One privatized.95 The protections in Section 4.7 that require among other things a \nRemoval Notice, a shareholder meeting, and a vote in which all shareholders can \nparticipate, are central to the Governance Agreement’s limitations on the pro vince’s \nability to interfere with the governance of Hydro One with respect to the CEO and the \nboard of directors. Moreover, as evident from the Commission’s inquiry during the \nhearing on May 22, 2018, Section 4.7 is centrally important to the Commission as  a \nprotective measure in the Governance Agreement.  \n75 Mr. Scarlett’s testimony that the resignation of the board and CEO Schmidt’s retirement, \nignoring the protections afforded by Section 4.7, are explained fully by their \ndetermination that these acts would b e in the best interests of Hydro One also lacks \ncredibility.96 As confirmed on October 23, 2018, Hydro One’s share price dropped \ndramatically on July 12, 2018, its credit rating was downgraded, equity analysts lowered \ntheir expectations for the stock and ra tcheted down their recommendations, and the \nregulatory review process underway for the proposed transaction was disrupted in three \nstates, including Washington.  Testimony by Mr. Scarlett and Mr. Dobson shows  a lack of \n                                                 \n94 Exh.

Only one \nHydro One witness, Mr. Woods, the new Chairman of the Board, acknowledged tha t the events of \nJuly 11, 2018, were not in the best interests of Hydro One  or Avista. TR 449:22 -450:14.

Among other things, t heir actions  did not  \nforestall the provincial government from introducing “legislation with potentially \nintrusive provisions .”99 The Mi nister of Energy introduced Bill 2, Urgent Priorities Act, \n2018, into the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on July 16, 2018. The province \nproclaimed the Hydro One Accountability Act into law on August 15, 2018.  \n                                                 \n97 Mr. Scarlett testified that given the rushed nature of internal discussions at Hydro One leading \nup to July 11, 2018, he could not recall any direct conversation about “the potential imp act [the \nboard’s resignation might have] on this transaction and its regulatory review” and “there weren’t \na lot of internal discussion about impacts one way or the other.” TR 409:17 -410:5. Nor could he \nrecall any discussions about what the impact would be  on Hydro One’s stock. TR 409:8 -16. This \nwas despite there being discussions about “what the fiduciary duties are to look out for the best \ninterest of the company.” TR 409:12 -16. Fiduciary duties, of course, run to the shareholders who \ntake a keen interest  in the value of their shares and corporate actions that affect the stock price. \nMr. Scarlett testified in addition, however, that “as soon as [the board resignation and CEO \nretirement] occurred and we did the press release, you know, then we had our conve rsations, it \nwas clear that it was − the impact would be that it would be troubling to people. My own view \nwas that while the − there was clearly a short -term impact, it was basically on Hydro One, and \nthat we did not believe, and I still don’t believe, th at the impact is really on Avista. I think that \nthere’s a short -term period of uncertainly, but I think that the way we’ve structured our deal, it’s \nsort of neutral to Avista.” TR 410:6 -16. In fact, Hydro One’s stock remains depressed relative to \nits value  before July 11, 2018, and Avista’s stock also experienced lost value that has not been \nrecovered, so far as we know.  \nMr. Dobson, then CFO at Hydro One, also was not consulted by the board concerning likely \nconsequences for Hydro One’s stock value, the lik ely reaction of ratings analysts, or the likely \nimpact on Avista’s stock value. See TR 479:6 -481:17.  \n98 Significantly, neither former CEO Schmidt nor any member of the former board was offered by \nHydro One to provide testimony based on personal knowledge th at might support Mr. Scarlett’s \nassertions that the former CEO and members of the board considered their actions to be in Hydro \nOne’s best interests . \n99 See Scarlett, Exh. JDS -1T at 6:13 -7:2. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 34 \nORDER 07  \n \n77 Nor do we find that , having waived certain of  the express provisions in Section 4.7 of the \nGovernance Agreement,  “the Province and Hydro One complied with the spirit and intent \nof Section 4.7 of the Governance Agreement.”100 The spirit and intent of the provisions \nrequiring the province to provide a “R emoval Notice setting out its intention to request \nHydro One to hold a Shareholders meeting [(a Removal Meeting)] for the purposes of \nremoving all of the Directors then in office, including the Provincial Nominees, with the  \nexception of the CEO and, at the  Province’s sole discretion, the Chair ” and the provisions \nin Sections 4.7.4 and 4.7.5 are perfectly clear. These are meant to protect the rights of all \nshareholders and to prevent a removal and replacement process for the board  that \nelevated the interests  of a single shareholder, the province, above that of all other \nshareholders. In addition, Section 4.7 makes an express exception for the CEO from the \nprovince’s removal rights.  \n78 Mr. Scarlett’s belief that it was not necessary to follow the requirements in  these \nprovisions of the Governance Agreement because the outcome was a foregone conclusion \nis beside the point.101 If CEO Schmidt and every board member shared Mr. Scarlett’s \nbelief, this too is beside the point. The point is that all shareholders in a priv ate \ncorporation have equal rights and their rights should be acknowledged in all processes \nthat call for their participation. In this case, their rights were ignored ; they were given no \nopportunity to air any concerns they may have had in connection with t he removal of the \nCEO and the entire board of directors. In addition, waiving these provisions of the \nGovernance Agreement in a singular effort to effect as quickly as possible the results the \nnew provincial government had promised in the run up to the Jun e 7, 2018, election  \nshows that Hydro One remains very much subject to the province’s authority and, as a \npractical matter, in the province’s control.  It simply cannot be considered  an independent, \npublicly  traded  company with a board of directors possessed of sufficient independence \nand power to protect Hydro One from political interference likely to cause harm to the \ncompany, much less to protect Avista from the consequences of bad decisions at Hydro \nOne driven b y the political whims of the controlling party in Ontario. Premier Ford is \nknown to have  said “Hydro One is not a private corporation .”102 Ultimately,  the province \nis in control; it has not relinquished its power and authority over the board of directors \nand, hence, its power and authority over Hydro One.  \n                                                 \n100 Id. \n101 See Scarlett, TR 401:24 -402:18; 3:13 -404:7.  \n102 See supra  ¶ 43. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 35 \nORDER 07  \n \n79 Yet, the province is not the counterparty with whom Avista negotiated and agreed to the \ntransaction proposed by the Joint Applicants in this docket. Nor has the province made \nany pronouncement of its support  for the transaction or  commitment to the express \nrequirements of  the Settlement Stipulation to which it is not a party.103 We simply have \nno assurances that the province will not, using legislative or other powers, exert its \ncontrol over Hydro One in ways t hat undercut one or more of the Settlement Stipulation \ncommitments or otherwise cause  harm to Avista.  \n80 The protective provisions in the Settlement Stipulation unfortunately do not, and cannot, \nprotect Avista from harm that might follow from actions the prov ince may take with \nrespect to Hydro One. The province may be nominally a minority shareholder, but Mr. \nScarlett made clear that as a practical matter it retains sufficient power over the board of \ndirectors to cause the board to make decisions that are not in the best interest of Hydro \nOne. Despite Mr. Scarlett’s protestations to the contrary, it is inescapably true that the \nboard’s sudden resignation and the CEO’s immediate retirement were hastily agreed to \nwithout any due diligence concerning what the cons equences might be in terms of \nshareholder value, credit analysts’ ratings, equity analysts’ ratings, the status and \nreputation of Hydro One in the business community, or pending regulatory reviews \nconcerning a proposed multi -billion dollar acquisition.  \n81 Actions already taken by the provincial government without giving due consideration to \nthe harm it might cause Hydro One demonstrate the potential for harm to Avista that \nmight follow from its acquisition by Hydro One.104 There is nothing to prevent legislatio n \nin Ontario that might undercut by indirect means Avista’s ability to provide its customers \nor the broader community one or more of the benefits promised by the Settlement \nStipulation. There is nothing to prevent the province from passing legislation that  will \nprevent Hydro One from living up to one or more of the protective commitments in the \nSettlement Stipulation. Legislation already has been passed into law  giving the province \nsignificant authority over executive compensation that may impair the board’ s ability to \nattract and retain executives with experience and ability comparable to that of Avista \nCEO Morris or CEO’s at other well -run investor -owned utilities. Legislation may be \nforthcoming in Ontario to effect the PCP’s commitment to reduce Hydro One ’s rates by \n12 percent, or some other amount, thus negatively impacting Hydro One’s revenues. \n                                                 \n103 Woods, TR 460:5 -13 (Responding to the question: “has the provin cial government stepped up \nand said in any formal fashion that it stands by this agreement, that it supports this agreement?” \nMr. Woods testified: “I can confirm that they have not.”)  \n104 We note, again, that the events of July 11, 2018, also were taken without regard to the harm \nthat might be caused to Avista.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 36 \nORDER 07  \n \nWere such legislation to affect adversely Hydro One’s ability to provide financial \nprotection and support to Avista, the Company’s ability to continue providing s afe and \nreliable service to Washington customers at reasonable rates could be impaired.  \n82 Indeed, the parties recognized after the events of July 11, 2018, the need for an additional \ncommitment to protect against, and provide recourse if, the province or an y other \ngovernmental entity in Canada took a position or action that affected Avista’s operations \nor prevented compliance with the Settlement commitments . It was Staff’s intent that new \nCommitment 82 would accomplish this goal.105 Mr. McGuire testified that:  \n[A]fter the recent actions in Ontario, we thought it would be useful to the \nCommission to negotiate another commitment that would allow the \nCommission to have recourse against some other unforeseeable event.  \n So in my mind, this commitment is a protection  for the Commission in \nthe event that anything else comes to pass, that the Commission or any of \nthe intervening parties here deem to be detrimental to Avista or its \nratepayers.106 \nCommitment 82 provides, in part:  \nNotice and Petition for Re -Hearing: In the e vent of the enactment or \nadoption of any legislation, rule, policy, or directive by government at any \nlevel or by any governmental entity or official in Canada (a “Legislative \nAction”) that affects Avista’s operations because of Avista’s corporate \nrelation ship with Hydro One, or affects Hydro One’s compliance with any \ncommitment in this stipulation, any of the parties to this proceeding may \npetition the Commission at any time for a re -hearing that re -opens the \nrecord in Docket U -170970 to consider whether t he Commission should \nchange its final order . \nIn Staff’s view:  \n[Commitment 82 ] benefits the ratepayers by giving parties and the \nCommission recourse again in the event that something detrimental \nhappens. Something that the Commission or other parties perceive as \nbeing detrimental to Avista or its ratepayers, those parties and the \n                                                 \n105 McGuire, TR 499:9 -17. \n106 TR 500:2 -10. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 37 \nORDER 07  \n \nCommission can use this commitment to reopen the record and redecide \nthis issue.107 \n83 This, however, provides recourse without any apparent remedy, or at least none that Staff \ncould identify.108 Staff contemplated that the Commission might rescind its approval of  \nthe proposed transaction following reconsideration under Commitment 82.109 It is clear, \nhowever, that this would be impossible to do.110  \n84 The post -election events that we describe in this Order demonstrate the willingness and \nability of the province , in cooperation with the former Hydro One board and CEO, and \nthrough legislation,  to pursue the realization of  political promise s and goals without \nregard to the consequences this might have for Hydro One in terms of shareholder value, \neven undercutting the pr ovince’s own interests as a shareholder . The province  and Hydro \nOne acted without apparent regard for the impact their actions might have relative to the \nongoing regulatory approval process, delaying and putting at risk Hydro One’s proposed \n$5.3 billion ac quisition of Avista. There is nothing to forestall the province from passing \nadditional legislation, or again forcing the cooperation of the board of directors by the \nthreat of removal, to elevate the province’s political interests above the interests of o ther \nshareholders and stakeholders.  In the final analysis, considering the legislative power the \nprovince wields, there is no commitment Hydro One could make that would protect \nHydro One against provincially  imposed requirements that would constrain or for estall \nHydro One’s ability to live up to its commitments under the Settlement Stipulation \nthereby causing direct or indirect harm to Avista . Avista’s ability  to protect itself from \nactions by  the provincial government  that interfere with Hydro One’s abilit y to live up  to \nthe Settlement commitments is questionable and would be limited, at best. The \nCommission’s ability to protect Avista , were  we to approve its acquisition by a company  \nthat for all practical purposes remains  under  the control of a sovereign g overnment, \nwould be equally limited, if it exists at all . The risk of harm to Avista is too great and the \nability to protect Avista against harm is too slight  for this transaction to be considered “in \nthe public interest.”  The proposed transaction does not  meet the threshold “no harm” \nstandard and this determination requires the Commission to deny the transaction under \nRCW 80.01.040(3) and WAC 480 -143-170. \n                                                 \n107 McGuire, TR 501:3 -10. \n108 See TR 501:11 -19. \n109 McGuire, TR 503:1 -11. \n110 As Commissioner Rendah l rhetorically asked both Mr. Scarlett and then Mr. McGuire: “How \ndo you un -ring a bell?” TR 483:21 -23; 501:11 -12. \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 38 \nORDER 07  \n \nB. Proposed Benefits  \n85 Our determination in the preceding section of this Order means there is no need to \nconsider in detail the promised affirmative benefits of this transaction that were meant by \nthe parties to satisfy the “net benefit to customers” standard in RCW 80.12.020 . \nHowever , we consider briefly the extent to which  the promised affirmative benefits \ncompensate for the unavoidable risks presented . We find the  affirmative benefits \npromised to ratepayers are , in fact  moderate in amount and relatively  brief in duration . \nWe must acknowledge the testimony that there will be few, if any,  synergies arising from \nthe proposed merger  particularly in the short -term. As a result any cost savings cannot be \nquantified in advance or even assured .111 Although  the transaction  promises  any cost \nsavings realized  will flow through  to ratepayers , these  will be offset  initially , at least in \npart, against the promised rate credits.112  \n86 The rate credits and other financial benefits promised  under the terms of the Settlement \nStipulation  will be paid largely, if not completely, out of Avista’s revenue recovered  in \nrates and otherwise recorded  on Avista’s books as net income. The Avista Board of \nDirectors has the discretion to treat net income as  retained earnings available for \ndividends to shareholders or to re-invest in the Company. Thus, the source proposed  to \nfund affirmative commitments under the Settlement Stipulation  are “shareholder” funds \nonly in the sense that any retained earnings used to provide benefits to customers will not \nbe paid as dividends  to Hydro One.  \n87 Since Avista ’s independent board  presumabl y would retain discretion  over the allocation \nand use of retained earnings  if the merger were consummated , it is more  difficult to \nconceive of the benefits identified in the Settlement commitments as “shareholder \nfunded” net benefits to Avista’s customers when the  customers  paid in the revenue from \nwhich the net income was  derived  in the first place . Effectively, Avista ratepayers, not \n“shareholders” or Hydro One are paying for the rate credits and other monetary benefits \nof the Settlement commitments. In principle, at least, t hese revenues would be available \nto Avista for the purposes  specified in the Settlement with or without the merger . That is,  \nAvista, if it chose to do so, could  today  propose to confer the same benefits to customers \n                                                 \n111 See Schmidt, Exh. MMS -1T at 22:11 -15; 33:1 -28; Morris, TR 270:23 -25; 273:3 -4. \n112 See Morris, Exh. SLM -5T at  8:6-15.  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 39 \nORDER 07  \n \nand the community u sing its retained earnings  as would be made available under the \nterms of the Settlement Stipulation .113 \n88 Finally, t he rate credits and other financial benefits that total to $73.7 million over five to \nten years, depending on the commitment , are neither de min imis nor particularly generous  \nwhen compared  against the $450 million to $900 million stream of revenue that will flow \nfrom Avista to Hydro One  over five to ten years  if Avista maintains the level of dividend \npayments made during recent periods.114 Certainly, the se benefits  are not so large as to \ncompensate to any meaningful extent for the risks Avista would face as a subsidiary of \nHydro One.  \nC. Conclusion  \n89 The inherent risks of the proposed transaction for Avista and its customers are manifest \nand sign ificant. While we accept that the Settlement Stipulation is “state of the art” in \nterms of the individual commitments that protect against specific risks, it is the overall \nrisk of this transaction  − the risk that the Province of Ontario will exert its pow er and \nauthority over Hydro One in ways that harm Avista  − that overwhelms our ability to \napprove it. New Commitment 82 in the Settlement Stipulation is not meaningfully \nprotective because there would be  no meaningful remedy available after “reconsidering”  \nour approval of the proposed transaction once it is given, even if it is shown in a hearing \non reconsideration that the province has taken steps that harm Avista.  \n90 We cannot overemphasize the importance of the fact that while it may be true that the \ngover nment of Ontario cannot act directly against Avista in Washington, it is equally true \nthat the province can interfere with Hydro One’s affairs in ways that could undercut \ncommitments set out in the merger agreement and Settlement Stipulation that  will harm  \nAvista. We will have, if this ensues, no practical means to remedy the harm. The \nproposed transaction does not meet even the lower bar of the no harm standard that \n                                                 \n113 We acknowledge that t his is not likely because it probably would force Avista to reduce \ndividends, which could adversely affect its share price.  \n114 See Exh. JNT -1T (revised) at 14:1 - 15:9 (“[I]f this total shareholder funding of $44.3 million \nin Washington were applied to othe r jurisdictions on a ‘most favored nations ’ [(MFN)] basis (see \nCommitment [81]), the cost to shareholders/quantifiable benefits to customers would approximate \n$74 million over the five to ten year period (depending on the specific commitment) after the \nmerger closes .”); see also  Theis, TR 387:2 -7 (“we pay [out of net income] approximately it’s \nabout a hundred million or 90 to a hundred million dollars. I don’t know, again, the exact amount \nis dividends to shareholders. And then the rest is reinvested in the  business as part of our retained \nearnings.”).  \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 40 \nORDER 07  \n \nguided our decisions in cases such as this before 2009.  It most certainly does not satisfy \nthe more demanding net benefit standard. We cannot find and conclude on the basis of \nthe record that Avista and its customers will be better off with this proposed merger than \nwithout it. We find and conclude, moreover, that the proposed transaction is not  in the \npublic interest. It follows from these determinations that we cannot approve the proposed \ntransaction under RCW 80.12.020, RCW 80.01.040(3), and WAC 480 -143-170. \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n91 Having discussed above in detail the evidence received in this procee ding concerning all \nmaterial matters, and having stated findings and conclusions upon issues in dispute \namong the parties and the reasons therefore, the Commission now makes and enters the \nfollowing summary of those facts, incorporating by reference pertin ent portions of the \npreceding detailed findings:  \n92 (1) The Commission is an agency of the state of Washington vested by statute with \nthe authority to regulate rates, regulations, practices, accounts, securities, transfers \nof property , and affiliated interest s of public service companies, including electric \nand natural gas companies.  \n93 (2) Avista is a “public service company,” an “electrical company,” and “gas \ncompany” as those terms are defined in RCW 80.04.010 and used in Title 80 \nRCW. Avista provides electric  and natural gas utility service to customers in \nWashington.  \n94 (3) Hydro One, formerly a Crown Corporation, has been since November 2015, and \nis today, an investor -owned electric transmission and distribution utility \nheadquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Province of Ontario retains a 47 \npercent ownership share in Hydro One. Hydro One provides electric distribution \nservice to more than 1.3 million  retail end -use customers, as well as electric \ntransmission service to many local distribution companies and large industrial \ncustomers.  \n95 (4)  There is a Governance Agreement between the province and Hydro One  that was \nnecessary to its transition from being  a Crown Corporation to being a publicly  \nheld corporation. It was necessary, in significant part, to reassure potential \ninvestors that the Province of Ontario would not interfere in Hydro One’s affairs.  \nThe Governance Agreement, among other things, establi shed detailed \nrequirements and processes that were to be followed if the provincial government \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 41 \nORDER 07  \n \nwished to remove and replace the Hydro One Board of Directors, but not the \nCEO.  \n96 (5) On June 7, 2018, provincial elections in Ontario resulted in the PCP gaining a \nmajority in the Legislative Assembly. The party featured prominently in its \nelection  campaign a promise to fire Hydro One’s Chief Executive Officer and \nreplace the entire Board of Directors. The PCP majority was seated on June 29, \n2018 . \n97 (6)  On July 11, 2018, the first session  of the 42nd Parliament of the Legislative \nAssembly of Ontario commenced and the new majority government was seated. \nOn this same date, following an approach by Hydro One to the province, the \nentire Hydro One Board of Dir ectors entered into a Letter Agreement with the \nprovince waiving certain protections and processes set out in Section 4.7 of the \nGovernance Agreement that required notice to shareholders and a shareholder \nvote if the province wished to remove and replace t he board, and that expressly \ndenied the province the power to remove the CEO.  \n98 (7)  Hydro One publicly announced on July 11, 2018, that the entire Board of \nDirectors had agreed to resign by August 15, 2018, that a new board would be \nappointed by that date, and that the Hydro One CEO would retire effective \nimmediately.  \n99 (8)  There is no evidence that the Board of Directors considered the potential adverse \nconsequences that might follow from these events, once announced. There is \nevidence suggesting that no suc h due diligence review was conducted with \nrespect to several specific risks of harm that could reasonably be anticipated \nwould follow from Hydro One’s July 11, 2018, announcement.  \n100 (9)  Hydro One’s share price dropped dramatically on July 12, 2018, its cred it rating \nwas downgraded, equity analysts lowered their expectations for the stock and \nratcheted down their recommendations, and the regulatory review process \nunderway for the proposed transaction was disrupted in three states, including \nWashington. Avista ’s share price also dropped significantly on July 12, 2018.  \n101 (10) The Ontario Minister of Energy introduced on July 16, 2018, Bill 2, the Urgent \nPriorities Act, 2018, which included in Schedule 1 the Hydro One Accountability \nAct. The new provincial governme nt passed Bill 2 into law and it became \neffective on August 15, 2018. This new law gave the province a direct and active \nrole in setting, and continuing oversight of, executive compensation at Hydro \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 42 \nORDER 07  \n \nOne. The law also amended the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1 998, to prohibit the \ninclusion in rates of compensation paid to the CEO and executives of Hydro One.  \n102 (11) There is a continuing risk of further provincial government interference in Hydro \nOne’s affairs via exertion of influence over the board  as Hydro One’ s largest, and \ndominant shareholder, or by further  legislative action . \n103 (12) Provincial government interference in Hydro One’s affairs, the risk of which has \nbeen shown by events to be significant , could result in direct or indirect harm  to \nAvista  if it were acquired by Hydro One, as proposed. This, in turn , could \ndiminish Avista’s ability to continue providing safe and reliable electrical and \nnatural gas service to its customers  in Washington . \n104 (13) The inherent risks of the proposed transaction ar e not adequately protected against \nby the Settlement commitments and cannot be adequately protected against  \nbecause, if the merger were consummated, Avista could not be restored to the \nstatus quo ante.  Avista’s customers would be at greater risk of sufferi ng harm \nwere this proposed transaction to receive all necessary regulatory approvals and \nbe consummated than if it is not approved and does not occur.   \n105 (14) Hydro One and Avista intend that  such affirmative  benefits as are offered  by the \nSettlement commitm ents will be funded out of Avista’s revenues  approved for \nrecovery by the Commission  that yield net income , which can be paid out in \ndividends or treated as retained earnings  available for other purposes  at the \ndiscretion of the Avista Board of Directors . These revenues would be available to \nAvista for these purposes with or without the merger and Avista  could, if it chose \nto do so, confer the same benefits to customers and the community using its \nretained earnings.  \n106 (15) Avista’s customers would be no bett er off with this transaction than they  would \nbe without it.  \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW  \n107 Having discussed above in detail the evidence received in this proceeding concerning all \nmaterial matters, and having stated findings and conclusions upon issues in dispute \namon g the parties and the reasons therefore, the Commission now makes and enters the \nfollowing summary of those conclusions , incorporating by reference pertinent portions of \nthe preceding detailed conclusions : \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 43 \nORDER 07  \n \n108 (1) The Commission has jurisdiction over the subje ct matter of, and parties to, these \nproceedings.  \n109 (2) Chapter 80.12 RCW requires public service companies, including Avista , to \nsecure Commission approval before they can lawfully sell or otherwise dispose of \nthe whole or any part of their franchises, properties or facilities that are necessary \nor useful in the performance of their duties to the public. Any sale  or disposition \nmade without Commission authority is void.  \n110 (3) Under RCW 80.12.020(1), the Commission “ shall not approve any transaction … \nthat would result in a person, directly or indirectly, acquiring a controlling interest \nin a gas or electrical company without a finding that the transaction would \nprovide a net benefit to the customers of the company .”  \n111 (4) WAC 480 -143-170 governs the Commissi on’s standard of review for a change of \ncontrol transaction and requires a finding that the transaction is consis tent with the \npublic interest.  \n112 (5) Having found that the proposed transaction does not make customers better off \nthan they would be without it  we conclude as a matter of law that the proposed \ntransaction does not provide a “net benefit to customers” as required under RCW \n80.12.020.  \n113 (6) RCW 80.01.040(3) requires the Commission to “[r]egulate in the public interest .” \nHaving found that the propose d transaction presents an unacceptably high level of \nrisk of direct or indirect harm to Avista  arising from  the ongoing, and  the \npotential for further, political interference by the Province of Ontario in Hydro \nOne’s affairs that could diminish Avista’s ab ility to continue providing safe and \nreliable electrical and natural gas service to its customers in Washington, the \nCommission determines under WAC 480 -143-170 that “the proposed transaction \nis not consistent with the public interest” and it accordingly “ shall deny the \napplication.”  \nORDER  \nTHE COMMISSION ORDERS THAT:  \n114 (1) The Joint Application of Avista Corporation and Hydro One Limited (acting \nthrough Olympus Equity LLC, an indirect, wholly  owned subsidiary ), for an \nOrder Authorizing Proposed Transaction , filed on September 14, 2017,  whereby  \nOlympus Equity LLC, a wholly owned Alaska limited  liability company and \nDOCKET U -170970    PAGE 44 \nORDER 07  \n \ncorporate subsidiary of Hydro One Limited, a Province of Ontario corporation, \nproposes to acquire all outstanding common stock of Avista  Corporation, a \nWashington corporation and a jurisdictional public service company, making \nAvista Corporation a direct, wholly  owned subsidiary of Olympus Equity LLC \nand an indirect, wholly  owned subsidiary of Hydro One  Limited, is denied.  \n115 (2) The Commission retains jurisdiction to effectuate the terms of this Order.  \nDATED at Olympia, Washington, and effective December 5, 2018.  \nWASHINGTON UTILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION  \nDAVID W.

Learn why this is important\nGood Morning, \n I am against the sale of Allete to BlackRock and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board(CPPIB). Please allow me to outline some of my concerns. 1. Loss of Local Control and AccountabilityAllete has long been a key player in the Upper Midwest, providing essential energy services tocommunities across Minnesota and beyond. The company is not just a business; it is a vitalpart of the region’s infrastructure, with a deep-rooted connection to its local economy. IfAllete were sold to global investment firms like BlackRock and CPPIB, much of its decision-making power could be shifted to corporate entities with limited ties to the region.BlackRock, while a powerful financial institution, has a track record of prioritizingshareholder returns, often at the expense of local stakeholders. The Canada Pension PlanInvestment Board, as a large state-backed investor, may not fully appreciate the unique needsand values of the communities that rely on Allete for stable, affordable, and sustainableenergy. Such a shift in ownership could lead to decisions that prioritize profit over the well-being of employees, customers, and the broader community, creating a disconnect betweenAllete’s operations and the local interests it serves.2. Focus on Short-Term Gains Over Long-Term SustainabilityBoth BlackRock and the CPPIB are primarily driven by financial returns. While this focus onprofitability is essential for investors, it often leads to decisions that favor short-term gainsover long-term stability and sustainability. Allete, as an energy provider, operates in a highlyregulated and complex industry that requires long-term planning and investment ininfrastructure, innovation, and sustainable practices.A change in ownership could result in cost-cutting measures, such as reducing investment inrenewable energy projects or delaying necessary upgrades to the electrical grid, in favor ofimmediate financial returns. This approach could undermine Allete’s ability to meet its long-term sustainability goals, negatively affecting its customers and the environment. Moreover,focusing too heavily on short-term profits could harm the company’s ability to adapt to theevolving energy landscape, particularly as the world shifts toward cleaner and more efficientenergy sources.3. Risks to Employee Well-being and Job SecurityWhen investment firms like BlackRock acquire companies, they often focus on maximizingprofits, which can involve reducing operational costs through layoffs, restructuring, oroutsourcing. While these moves may increase immediate shareholder returns, they come at theexpense of employee well-being and job security.Allete’s workforce, particularly in its energy and utility sectors, is integral to its ongoingsuccess. The prospect of job cuts or changes to benefits packages under new ownership couldlead to a demoralized workforce, lower employee engagement, and a decline in the company’soverall performance. Furthermore, such a change in ownership could drive away local talent,\nwho may feel that the company’s values no longer align with their own.\n4. Concentration of Power in Global Financial Institutions\nThe increasing concentration of corporate power in the hands of a few large investment firms\nraises important questions about market competition, fairness, and accountability. BlackRockand CPPIB are two of the world’s largest investment managers, each wielding significantinfluence over the global economy. Allowing them to acquire a company like Allete wouldonly increase their control over critical infrastructure, potentially diminishing competition andreducing consumer choice.Consolidation of ownership in the energy sector also leads to the creation of “too big to fail”entities, which can hold the power to influence policies, regulations, and market dynamics totheir advantage. As these firms grow in influence, the interests of consumers, communities,and employees may be sidelined in favor of maintaining or expanding the dominance of thesefinancial giants.5. Environmental and Social ConsiderationsBoth BlackRock and the CPPIB have made public commitments to environmental, social, andgovernance (ESG) principles. However, their focus on financial returns may conflict with theirESG rhetoric. These firms may prioritize short-term profitability over investments inrenewable energy sources or socially responsible projects, even if such investments arealigned with broader societal goals.Allete, on the other hand, has demonstrated a commitment to sustainable energy practices,particularly in its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and expand its renewable energyportfolio. The company's sale to BlackRock and CPPIB could undermine these efforts if thenew owners prioritize financial returns over Allete’s ongoing investments in clean energy andsustainability.6. The Risk of Foreign Influence on National Energy PolicyThe CPPIB is a state-backed entity, and while it operates as an independent investmentmanager, its ties to the Canadian government could raise concerns about foreign influenceover a vital U.S. energy provider. Energy policy is a critical aspect of national security, andallowing foreign entities to acquire significant stakes in energy companies may raise questionsabout the influence of foreign governments over domestic energy strategy.While there is no indication that the CPPIB would act against U.S. interests, the perception offoreign influence over critical infrastructure could lead to public concern and potentialregulatory scrutiny, especially given the current political climate between the US and Canada.This could harm the reputation of Allete and its new owners and create unnecessarygeopolitical tensions.\nThe sale of Allete to BlackRock and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board represents a\nshort-sighted approach that could have significant negative consequences for the company, itsemployees, its customers, and the communities it serves. From the loss of local control andaccountability to the potential risks of job cuts, environmental setbacks, and foreign influence,the move risks undermining the long-term sustainability of Allete and its contributions to theU.S. energy sector.Instead of selling off vital assets to large investment firms, it would be far more beneficial toexplore alternatives that allow Allete to continue serving the public interest while remainingaccountable to the communities that rely on its services. It is essential to prioritize long-termstability, sustainability, and responsible governance over immediate financial returns to ensurethe continued success of Allete in a rapidly changing energy landscape\nRegards, Brian Bergeron\nHermantown, MN\nMN Power and Allete customer\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nDear Public Utilities Commision Members,\nAs a Duluth resident and a Minnesota Power customer, I oppose the sale of Allete Corporation\nand Minnesota Power to the Private Equity Investors CPP and GIP. Public utilities provide anessential service, and we, as customers, are captive to the rates and quality of service availablein our area. Under the law, public utilities must operate in the public interest. Private Equityfirms, by contrast, operate in the interest of their investors and lenders.\nAllete, a publicly traded company, has hundreds of investors, but its board operates\nautonomously in the best interest of both customers and investors. On the other hand,CPP/GIP are private equity investors who plan to acquire all Allete stock above market value.They intend to make a quick profit to repay the debt on the investment and make money. I fearCPP/GIP will acquire Allete and have carte blanche to raise rates and cut services to squeezemore profits out of Minnesot Power. Where is the public interest in this deal?\nThe Minnesota Power argument for the Allete acquisition by CPP/GIP is to have more\nfinancial backing to transition to sustainable forms of energy. Being acquired by private equityis no guarantee that more resources will be available to make this transition. GIP is heavilyinvested in fossil fuels and is owned by the financial behemoth Black Rock. Black Rock willdo what is in its best interest and has plenty of lawyers to find loopholes around environmentalregulations. Private equity does not care about the future of Minnesota Power or its customers.\nYours truly,Judith Derauf\n3422 E 1st StDuluth, MN 55804218-393-0622\n   \n\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nI am a Minnesota Power customer living in an apartment building in Chisholm.  \nI have several concerns about the sale of ALLETE, Inc., which is the Duluth-based\ncompany that owns local utility Minnesota Power, to the Canada Pension Plan\nInvestment Board (CPP) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). \nFirst, GIP itself is owned by BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm.\nBlackRock’s $11.5 trillion in assets  under management exceeds the GDP of every\nnation  except the United States and China.  \nSecond, Minnesota Power and its proposed buyers have already hidden many details\nof their plans from public view behind “trade secret” designations. For example,Minnesota Power’s rate increase forecast is redacted, viewable only to interveningparties under non-disclosure agreements. In some cases, the companies have hiddeninformation even from intervenors and the judge without following appropriate legalprocedures for doing so. Several parties have raised concerns about this lack oftransparency. The judge has already  ordered\n the companies to disclose some of the\nhidden information and is now considering  another motion  recently filed by the Office\nof the Attorney General.  \nIf GIP and CPP are reluctant to disclose information now, when it is in their interest\nto earn stakeholders’ and government agencies’ support, we can only assume theywill be even more reluctant to do so in the future should the purchase go through.  \nBeyond basic transparency, expert testimony in the case also ties GIP leadership to a\nbankrupt solar company facing allegations of financial misconduct\n. As of June 2024,\nGIP owned a significant stake in SunPower, and two high-level GIP employees servedon SunPower’s board. That month, “SunPower’s independent accountant resignedbecause it was unwilling to be associated with financial statements prepared bymanagement,” citing misconduct. SunPower has since faced investigation by the USSecurities and Exchange Commission. SunPower’s executives and board members—including a GIP executive testifying in this case—have faced lawsuits\n related to its\nfinancial reporting. That executive provides little explanation of this issue inhis rebuttal testimony\n. \nThird, ALLETE’s new private owners may want to sell the utility if they view it as\nunprofitable. If CPP and GIP move to quickly resell ALLETE due to perceivedunderperformance, other potential buyers may be less eager to buy it. This could putMinnesota Power in a more precarious situation.  \nEven if the company does provide a healthy profit for its new owners, it may be for\nsale again soon. GIP's chair has said: \n\"We are quite opportunistic sellers. Each time we review an\ninvestment, the team has to justify why we should continue to own it...At the end of the day, we are a finite-life fund – everything we own isfor sale.” \nThe buyers have promoted claims\n like: “Private equity is typically long-term focused\nand more patient, in contrast to the public equity market” in which ALLETE and other\nMinnesota utilities are currently traded. However, publicly traded utility companiesare owned by hundreds or thousands of investors who frequently buy and sell sharesof the company. If any of ALLETE’s current shareholders decides to sell their ALLETEshares, there are likely other potential investors ready and willing to buy those shareson public markets without requiring regulatory approval or disrupting the utility’soperations. And, while five or ten years may be “long term” in the investment world,utility timeframes are much longer. It would be disruptive for CPP/GIP to putMinnesota Power up for sale again so quickly. \nUnder the proposed new ownership, Minnesota Power will have just two owners: CPP\nand BlackRock’s GIP. If one or both of those owners decides to sell, that sale wouldrequire review and approval by the PUC—meaning stakeholders would need to repeatthe contentious and complex regulatory process currently underway to review thisinitial proposed transaction. Plus, the PUC would face additional challenges in asecondary sale: either they approve a sale under potentially more risky or uncertaincircumstances or deny the sale, forcing Minnesota Power to remain owned byinstitutional investors no longer interested in investing in it. \nFourth, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the new owners to make back the\npurchase premium without leaning on ratepayers, which could lead to rate increases\nfor Minnesota Power customers.\nOf course, Minnesota Power’s rates must be approved by the PUC, and the company\nwill continue to have to justify any rate increases. However, if the PUC denies therate increases that Minnesota Power’s new owners want, the owners may decide it isnot in their interest to invest much more money in the company, to the detriment ofthe quality of service that Minnesotans receive. \nWe can ill afford to have large rate increases for unreliable electric sources.  These\nexcessive rate increases may cause large employers to shut down, causing job losses.\nPlease reject the sale of Minnesota Power to the Canada Pension Plan Investment\nBoard (CPP) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).  \nThank you for your time.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nAs former long-time employees of Allete/Minnesota Power, and as retirees\nwho receive both a pension and medical reimbursement from the company,we are writing to express our strong opposition to the proposed sale ofAllete to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a subsidiary of Blackrock,and the Canada Pension Plan Fund (CPP).\nWe are also current shareholders of Allete. However, if this deal is\napproved, all shareholders—ourselves included—will be forced to sell ourshares. We will have no choice in the matter. That alone is deeplyconcerning, as it strips away the voice and investment of long-timeemployees, retirees, and individuals who believe in the company’s long-term mission and its value to Minnesota communities.\nThis $6.2 billion sale is facing well-founded opposition from a diverse\ncoalition of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, the mining andwood products industries, and the Minnesota Department of Commerce.The concerns are substantial and credible: increased rates for customers,loss of local control, and a lack of transparency throughout the process.\nGIP and CPP argue that they are better positioned to fund Allete’s\nrenewable energy transition and infrastructure needs. Yet testimony fromfinancial and regulatory experts, including those representing theMinnesota Department of Commerce, disputes these claims. They cite a\nlack of evidence that the acquisition would improve access to capital or\nbenefit ratepayers in any meaningful way. In fact, the proposed transaction\nappears to pose significant risk of large rate increases, speculativeinvestment strategies, and an erosion of public oversight.\nFurthermore, we are disturbed by reports that GIP and CPP have avoided\ntransparency during these proceedings—refusing to answer questions fully,providing redacted responses, and limiting meaningful public engagement.This lack of openness is not compatible with the trust and accountabilityrequired of a utility provider responsible for serving Minnesota homes andbusinesses.\nMinnesota Power is more than a utility—it’s part of the fabric of the state\nand the communities it serves. It should not be turned over to private equityinterests with global portfolios and short-term profit motives. We urge theMinnesota Public Utilities Commission and all involved regulatory bodiesto reject this acquisition and preserve Allete’s accountability to the public.\nSincerely,\nSandra Peters\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 I. INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ Please state your name, title, and employer. 2 \nA My name is Courtney Lane. I am a Senior Principal at Synapse Energy Economics 3 \n(“Synapse ”), located at 485 Massachusetts Avenue, #3, Cambridge, M assachusetts 4 \n02139. 5 \nQ Have you previously submitted testimony in this proceeding?   6 \nA Yes. I submitted direct testimony in this proceeding on behalf of the Sierra Club on 7 \nFebruary  4, 2025. 8 \nQ What is the purpose of your surrebuttal  testimony?  9 \nA The purpose of my testimony is to respond to the Rebuttal Testimony of Andrew Alley 10 \non behalf of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP Investments”), the Rebuttal 11 \nTestimony of Jonathan Bram on behalf of Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”, 12 \ncollectively referred to wi th CPP Investments as “the Partners”), and the Rebuttal 13 \nTestimon ies of Colin Anderson, Ann Bulkley , Jennifer Cady , Ellen Lapson, Jeffery 14 \nScissons, and Joshua Taran on behalf of ALLETE d/b/a Minnesota Power (“the 15 \nCompany”). 16 \nQ How is your surrebuttal testimony  structured ?  17 \nA In Section II, I summarize my conclusions and recommendations. In Section III, I discuss 18 \nthe lack of justification for the proposed acquisition of all outstanding shares of ALLETE 19 \nby the Partners (“the Acquisition”) on the basis of the Compan y’s capital needs.  In 20 \nSection IV, I respond to arguments raised by the Company and Partner s (together, the 21 \n“Applicants”) in Rebuttal Testimony concerning my argument that the Acquisition will 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n2 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane   Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 increase risks for ratepayers. In Section V, I respond to Rebutt al Testimony regarding my 1 \nclaim that the Acquisition could negatively affect the Company’s ability to invest in clean 2 \nenergy resources and retire coal -fired power plants in compliance with Minnesota ’s 3 \nCarbon Free Standard and environmental regulations. In Section VI, I argue why 4 \ncommitments made in Rebuttal Testimony do not alleviate concerns about the 5 \nAcquisition reducing local control over the Company. In Section VI, I argue why despite 6 \narguments made in Rebuttal Testimony to the contrary, concerns about lack of 7 \ntransparency from the Partners provide a reason to reject the Acquisition. Finally, in 8 \nSection VIII, I again summarize my conclusions and recommendations.  9 \nII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10 \nQ Do the Applicants summarize commitments within rebuttal testimony? 11 \nA Yes. Witness Cady’s Rebuttal  Testimony Schedule 1 summariz es commitments and 12 \naffirmations by the Applicants , some of which are new and some of which were 13 \ncontained in the Company’s original Petition  or direct testimony .1 However, Schedule 1 14 \nin Witness Cady’s Rebuttal does not make clear which commitments are new and which 15 \nare existing. Following are several  of the Applicants’ commitments  which  pertain to 16 \naspects of my D irect and Surrebuttal T estimony : 17 \n1 Rebuttal Testimony of Jennifer Cady (hereinafter, “Cady Rebuttal”), Schedule 1  at 1 (noting \nthat Schedule 1 “specifies new commitments Minnesota Power, GIP, and CPP Investments \nare making to address the comments of Intervenors, as well as those commitment s previously \nstated in the Merger Agreement, Petition, and Direct Testimony ” (emphasis added)).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n3 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 • “Alloy Parent commits to prov ide to Minnesota Power equity financing, including 1 \nbut not limited  to equity infusion, deferral or reinvestment of dividends, or a 2 \ncombination of both, in an amount at least equal to the equity financing required to 3 \nfund Minnesota Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan reflected in its February 4 \n2025 10- K filing,  subject to prospective reasonable and prudent plan 5 \nadjustments. ”2  6 \n•  The Applicants make the following commitments  about the post-Acquisition 7 \nALLETE Board and governance: 8 \no The Company previously commi tted in its original Petition that “at least 9 \none member of the ALLETE Board of Directors must be from Minnesota, 10 \none member must be from Wisconsin, and the Board must have at least two 11 \nindependent directors” and that ALLETE’s chief executive officer (“CEO” ) 12 \nwill be  a Board member.3 The Company slightly modifies this commitment 13 \nin Rebuttal, stating that “[i] n addition to the ALLETE CEO, the ALLETE 14 \nboard will include two independent members, with one member from 15 \n                                                 \n2 Id.  \n3 Docket No. E015/PA-24- 198, Initial Filing – Petition for Approval (Minn. Pub. Util. Comm’n \nJuly 19, 2024) ( hereinafter “Petition”) at 11 -12; see also  Minn. Power Response to Sierra \nClub Information Request (“ IR”) 20(b) (provided in Attach.

Minnesota Power will list those 15 \nentities in the annual affiliated interest report. ”816 \n4 Cady Rebuttal , Schedule 1 at 2. \n5 Id. \n6 Id. \n7 Id. \n8 Id. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n5 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

Specific to the issues raised in my Direct 9 \nTestimony, the Acquis ition still poses several probable harms to the public interest:   10 \n• The Acquisition increases incentives for the Company to pursue its capital 11 \ninvestment plans in ways that are not cost- effective for ratepayers due to a bias 12 \ntoward capital projects over oth er approaches.  13 \n• The Acquisition increases the risk that operation of the Boswell coal -fired power 14 \nplant may be prolonged, which would undermine the Company’s stated clean 15 \nenergy goals.  16 \n• The Partners’ control over ALLETE’s board raises concerns about the degr ee to 17 \nwhich the board could be influenced in non- transparent ways to take action 18 \ncontrary to the public interest. 19 \n                                                 \n9 Id. at 3.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n6 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane   Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 •The Acquisition removes access to important financial information about the 1 \nultimate owners of ALLETE, harming the abilities of regulators and  stakeholders 2 \nto hold the Company and the Partners accountable. 3 \nQ Please summarize your recommendations.  4 \nA The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”)   should not approve the 5 \nproposed Acquisition  because the potential harms of the transaction for Minnesota 6 \nratepayers outweigh the uncertain, theoretical  benefits, and the Acquisition is therefore 7 \nnot consistent with the public interest.      8 \nIII. THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED A NEED FOR THIS 9 \nACQUISITION. 10 \nQ What is your claim about the Company’s capital needs? 11 \nA Throughout both direct and r ebuttal t estimony, ALLETE and the Partners claim without 12 \nevidence that the Acquisition is the best way to obtain the capital the Company need s 13 \ngoing forward. In my Direct Testimony, I noted that the Company has not cited any 14 \ninstance of being unable to obtain enough capital on public markets.10  This fact remains 15 \nunrebutted because, i n rebuttal testimony, the Company and Partner witnesses still have 16 \nnot cited any such instance. 17 \n10 Public Redacted Direct Testimony of Courtney Lane (hereinafter “Lane Direct  (Public) ”) at \n11:9-12:8 . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n7 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q Witness Taran claims this argument from your D irect T estimony is concerned with 1 \nthe past and “ignores the drastic change in circumstances going forward,” pointing 2 \nto projections that the Company’s future capital need “far outweighs” its historical 3 \nneed.11 Does his argument demonstrate that the Ac quisition is necessary to raise this 4 \nneeded capital?  5 \nA No. Witness Taran provides no evidence that the Company’s future capital needs, while 6 \ngreater than the past, will reach  some threshold where the Company cannot fulf ill those 7 \nneeds  via  public markets.  Witness Taran simply asserts that “ [a]ttempting to issue this 8 \nlevel of equity in public markets creates an enormous amount of risk for the Company 9 \nand its stakeholders.”12 But he never backs up this statement with an analysis 10 \ndemonstrating why this specific level of capital need would trigger such risks.  11 \nQ Are there ways to raise additional equity capital that would not trigger such risks 12 \nand do not require the Acquisition?  13 \nA Yes. One example would be for ALLETE to sell off some or all of its nonutility 14 \nsubsidiary businesses. Doing so would raise equity for Minnesota Power, while allowing 15 \nthe Company to focus on being a pure ly regulated utility business. Such a utility -focused 16 \nbusiness may enhance ALLETE’s appeal to conservative investors who typically bu y 17 \nstock in low- risk utility companies and have the willingness to temporarily forego 18 \ndividends that Witness Taran says the Company needs. 19 \n                                                 \n11 Rebuttal Testimony of Joshua Taran (hereinafter, “Taran Rebuttal”) at 29 -30. \n12 Id. at 18. \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n8 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

For example, 6 \nWitness Taran notes that the anticipated dividend payments for the Company are $170 7 \nmillion in 2025.14 However, Witness Taran does not assert th at $170 million in foregone 8 \ndividends would be sufficient to make the difference between raising enough equity in 9 \nthe relevant period or not. 10 \nIV. CAPITAL BIAS AND THE PARTNERS’ ABILITY TO  CONTROL FUTURE 11 \nINVESTMENT DECISIONS    12 \nQ Please summarize your argument s in your D irect Testimony regarding risks to 13 \nratepayers from the proposed Acquisition.  14 \nA In my D irect T estimony, I argued that if the Acquisition is completed, the Partners will 15 \nlikely attempt to increase the total return from ALLETE’s rate base and in this attempt 16 \nwill like ly pursue a capital -intensive resource development strategy that exacerbates the 17 \nutility’s existing incentives to minimize or overlook options that are more cost- effective 18 \nfor ratepayers.15 I argued that both theory and empirical evidence demonstrate that t he 19 \nPartners would attempt to increase returns post-Acquisition.16 The Partners would not 20 \n                                                 \n13 Id. at 9 -10. \n14 Id. at 9.  \n15 See Lane Direct  (Public) at 14 -21.  \n16 Id. at 14:19-16:13.  \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n9 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 propose taking the Company private if they did not believe doing so could lead to a 1 \nhigher return. Moreover, I explained that empirical evidence indicates that private equity 2 \ncompanies tend to enjoy greater returns than publicly- traded utilities .17 3 \nQ Do the Partners or ALLETE respond to these concerns?  4 \nA Not directly. Neither the Partners nor ALLETE disputed my arguments that in pursuit of 5 \nhigher returns on rate base, the post-Acquisition Company would be more heavily 6 \nincentivized to focus on capital-intensive options and overlook lower -cost demand -side 7 \nsolutions like grid -enhancing technologies, distributed resource management, or energy 8 \nefficiency. Some w itnesses partially r esponded to the concerns about the Company 9 \noverlooking power purchase agreements (“PPAs ”), which I will address later in this 10 \ntestimony . 11 \nQ Witness Bulkley claims that your position “fails to take into consideration the fact 12 \nthat as owners of ALLETE, the [P] artners have the ability to implement strategies 13 \nthat meet the clean energy transition goals of Minnesota Power as well as other 14 \nregulated and non- regulated investments that ALLETE will need to make in the 15 \nfuture, which cannot be implemented as stock market  investors.”18 Do you agree? 16 \nA No. My argument is not inconsistent with th e claim s that the Partners  would make 17 \ninvestments in ALLETE and that the Partners’ acquisition of the Company could enable 18 \nthe Partners to implement their preferred strategies. But the  Partners’  preferred strateg ies 19 \nnonetheless are likely to involve driving a higher return on investment than they could 20 \ngain from ALLETE as stock market investors. Witness Bulkley seems to be implying that 21 \n                                                 \n17 Id. at 15:12-16:2 . \n18 Rebuttal Testimony of Ann Bulkley (hereinafter, “Bulkley Rebuttal”) at 8 -9. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n10 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 a higher return is irrelevant to the goals of the Partners, which is not believable.  At the 1 \nsame time, she also claims that “ [a]ccomplishing this transition will substantially increase 2 \nthe value of ALLETE,”19 which seems to be an admission that returns will increase post- 3 \nAcquisition. 4 \nQ Witness Bulkley argue s that the Commission’s ability to review capital investments 5 \nbefore they are placed into service “creates the appropriate incentive to ensure that 6 \nutilities make sound investment decisions for customers” and alleviates concerns 7 \nthat any unnecessary capita l investments would be made “when operating expenses 8 \nwould have sufficed.”20 Do you agree? 9 \nA No. Witness Bulkley is ignoring the extent to which the Company itself has influence 10 \nover what the Commission is able to review. For example, Witness Bulkley refers to the 11 \nCommission’s role in Integrated Resource Plan (“ IRP”) proceeding s,  but the Company 12 \ncreates the menu of resource options that the Commission reviews in an IRP. At that 13 \npoint, the Commission is effectively limited to the menu of choices that the Compa ny has 14 \npresented  when making its final decision . If that menu is biased toward capital 15 \ninvestments  in lieu of  operating expenses, the Commission  can try to mitigate this bias 16 \nby disallowing certain aspects of the IRP, but it cannot craft a new resource plan without 17 \nutility cooperation.   18 \nFurthermore, w hile it is true that parties can  review and comment on an  IRP or rate case 19 \napplication , the utility will always have the most technical knowledge and information 20 \nregarding its  systems , load forecasts,  and models, and on the relative costs of alternatives. 21 \n                                                 \n19 Id. at 9.  \n20 Id. at 11. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n11 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane   Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 This is often referred to as information asymmetry . Parties and regulators face a 1 \nsignificant information disadvantage, which makes it challenging to  fully vet the 2 \nprudence of utility investment decis ions.   3 \nThe incentives the Company will face post -Acquisition and the pressure from the 4 \nPartners to increase return s will operate as a countervailing force that may impede or 5 \ncomplicate the Commission ’s efforts to ensure that the Company’s resource planning and 6 \ninvestments  are in the best interests of ratepayers . While the Commission’s oversight role 7 \ncan curb a utility’s excesses, i t is better to have a utility that acts as a partner and 8 \nproposes sound investment decisions from the beginning . As I explained  in my Direct 9 \nTestimony, the Acquisition would exacerbate incentives that make the Company more 10 \nlikely to act in ways that are not in ratepayers’ best interest . 11 \nQ In response to your argument in d irect testimony that the Company may overlook 12 \nlower- cost resources like PPAs in favor of capital -intensive options, Witnesses 13 \nBram21 and Taran22 claim these concerns are misplaced because new resources are 14 \nselected as part of competitive processes that mitigate the ability of the Company to 15 \nprefer self -build options over PPAs. Do you agree with their responses?  16 \nA No. Both  witnesses ignore the fact that even under a competitive process that is 17 \nindependently evaluated, such as an all -source request for proposals, there are subjective 18 \nfactors that help determine what resources win the resulting bid. These subjective factors 19 \ncan include, for example, the Company’s judgments about the experience level of the 20 \nbidders. The Company can choose to favor its self-build options by emphasizing certain 21 \n21 Rebuttal Testimony of Jonathan Bram (hereinafter, “Bram Rebuttal”) at 17.  \n22 Taran Rebuttal at 31.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n12 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 subjective factors over others. Factors like these have caused other regulatory 1 \ncommissions to take steps to ensure that certain percentages of competitive solicitations 2 \nare reserved for PPAs with third parties.23 Post-Acquisition, t he Company would be 3 \nunder greater pressure to pursue more capital -intensive self -build options over PPAs and 4 \nother lower- cost alternatives in order to increase returns from rate base.  5 \nQ Witness Bram claims that your D irect T estimony argued that “existing plans, 6 \nincluding the Commission- approved balanced selection process, should be 7 \nmaterially modified to favor [PPAs] in lieu of constructing generation.”24 Is this an 8 \naccurate description of your testimony?  9 \nA No. I have never argued that PPAs should be favored in the resource selection process , 10 \nonly that they should be allowed to compete on a level playing field. My argument was 11 \nand remains  that the Company has incentives to prefer constructing its own generation 12 \nrather than signing PPAs, and that these incentives wou ld be stronger post-Acquisition, 13 \nso the Commission should be vigilant to ensure that the Company is not overlooking 14 \nopportunities for PPAs. This argument does not imply that PPAs should always be 15 \npreferred to constructing generation as a rule. This misinterpretation of my argument 16 \nseems to carry over to Witness Alley’s Rebuttal Testimony, where he claims that “some 17 \nParties seem to assume . . . that the Company can meet all of its Carbon Free Standard 18 \nobligations through power purchase agreements and other companies building all 19 \n                                                 \n23 For example,  in Michigan Public Service Commission Case No. U-20165, Consumers Energy \nagreed to utilize a 50/50 capacity procurement structure whereby Consumers Energy would purchase 50% of future capacity needs through PPAs with third parties.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 necessary transmission.”25 But I never claimed that all of the Company’s Carbon Free 1 \nStandard obligations can be met through PPAs or third- party contracts . 2 \nQ Witness Bram  asserts that “ [u]tilizing PPAs to achieve clean energy goals often is 3 \nmuch more costly than Company -owned generation” and he claims that renewable 4 \nPPA prices are volatile and increasing.26 How do you respond?  5 \nA I do not disagree that there are times when Company- owned generat ion may be more 6 \ncost-effective than PPAs; however, the renewable energy PPA price data provided by 7 \nWitness Bram is misleading. Witness Bram provides a graph of PPA prices since 2021 8 \nfor wind, blended, and solar.27 Yet he fails to compare the PPA prices to the levelized 9 \ncost of energy should the utility self-build those same resources. While PPA prices have 10 \nincreased since 2021 due to factors like supply chain issues and inflation, those same 11 \nmarket conditions are also impacting utility -owned generation. For example, the most 12 \nrecent Lazard Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis report shows a similar spike in prices 13 \nfor those resources from 2021-2024.28 14 \nFurthermore, the implication that PPAs are usually much more expensive is undercut by 15 \nWitness Taran’s Rebuttal Testimony. He states that “the Company’s projected capital 16 \nexpenditure forecast already assumes some level of resource additions are served through 17 \nPPAs,” and notes that the majority of the remaining 100 MW of solar projected to be 18 \n                                                 \n25 Rebuttal Testimony of Andrew Alley (hereinafter, “Alley Rebuttal”) at 25.  \n26 Bram Rebuttal at 17 -18. \n27 Id. at 18. \n28 Lazard Levelized Cost of Energy, 17 (June 2024), available at  \nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards -lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf . \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n14 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane   Docket Nos.

I did 11 \nnot argue that the Company post-Acquisition will be motivated to build new resources in 12 \nexcess of what is required to comply with the Carbon Free Standard. Rather, my 13 \nargument is that the Company, in pursuit of higher returns, will be incentivized to try to 14 \ncomply with the Carbon Free Standard in ways that are not the most cost- effective for 15 \nratepayers  by foregoing least -cost compliance options. The  risk that the Partn ers may 16 \npressure the Company to overinvest is likely to increase the cost of the Company’s plans 17 \nfor complying with the Carbon Free Standard , but this point about overinvestment does 18 \nnot involve the separate question of whether  the Company complies with th e standard  at 19 \nall. 20 \n29 Taran Rebuttal at 16.  \n30 Id. at 31. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n15 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 As will be detailed in the next section, while there is a  risk that the Acquisition could 1 \nharm the Company’s ability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard, that risk  arises 2 \nfrom the possibility that the Partners could sell the Company prior to closure of the 3 \nCompany’s coal plants and the risk that the Partners’ goals could change.

THE PARTNERS CONTINUE TO  AVOID AFFIRMATIVE COMMITMEN TS 6 \nTO INVEST IN CLEAN RESOURCES AND RETIRE COAL PLANTS .   7 \nQ Please summarize the issues you raised in your Direct T estimony regarding the 8 \nimpact of the Acquisition on Minnesota Power ’s ability  to comply with the Carbon 9 \nFree Standard . 10 \nA In my Direct Testimony, I raised two risks related to the Acquisition:  11 \n1. The Partners could exit and sell their shares of ALLETE prior to the Company 12 \nretiring its coal generation. There is no guarantee that the next owners of 13 \nALLETE will support Minnesota Power’s plans to cease op eration of its coal 14 \nunits, and those future owners are likely to seek control of the ALLETE Board, 15 \nwhich includes approval of Minnesota Power’s budgets and business plans.31    16 \n2. There is no guarantee within the merger agreement that the Partners will not seek 17 \nto change the Company’s planned coal retirement dates after the Acquisition is 18 \ncomplete.32   19 \n                                                 \n31 Lane Direct (Public) at 34:3-8. \n32 Id. at 34:1-3. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n16 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q How do the Applicants respond to your concerns regarding when the Partners 1 \nmight sell their interests in ALLETE?  2 \nA The Partners commit to provide sufficient capital to fund the Company’s five- year capital 3 \ninvestment plan  as reflected in its February 25 10K filing , subject to all existing 4 \nCommission regulation and decision- making.33 However, the Partners still have not 5 \ncommitted to maintain their ownership of ALLETE  for any particular length of time.  6 \nIn addition, Witness Bram indicates that the parties to this proceeding should not be 7 \nconcerned about a potential future sale of ALLETE by the Partners because any future 8 \nsale of Minnesota Power by the Partners will be s ubject to approval by the 9 \nCommission .34 Witness Bram goes on to assert  that this requirement provides customer 10 \nprotection as the Commission will ensure that the “terms and timing of any future 11 \ntransactions are in the public interest.”35     12 \nQ Does the new commitment made by the Partners to fund Minnesota Power’s five- 13 \nyear capital plan address your concerns?  14 \nA No. ALLETE’s five -year capital plan as provided in its February 2025 Form 10-K only 15 \nextends to 2029.36 This date is prior to the Company’s plan to cease coal  operations at 16 \nBoswell Unit 3 by 2030 and Boswell Unit 4 by 2035.  17 \n                                                 \n33 Cady Rebuttal, Schedule 1 at 1.   \n34 Bram Rebuttal  at 23 :7-11. \n35 Id. at 23:12. \n36 ALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10- K, 62 (February 13, 2025), available at  \nhttps://investor.allete.com/static -files/b85c9f8e- 24a2 -4a28- b1f9-c39f9a99090a , excerpt \nprovided as Attachment CLS-2. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n17 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q How do you respond to the Partners’ assurances that the Commission must approve 1 \nany sale of ALLETE by the Partners ?   2 \nA I find the Partners fail to appreciate the risks associated with the fu ture sale of ALLETE. 3 \nThere is no guarantee that the next owner of ALLETE will support Minnesota Power’s 4 \nplans to cease operation of its coal units. A future buyer may seek to modify coal 5 \nretirement timelines or change investment priorities.  6 \nWhile it is true that the Commission will need to approve any future sale of ALLETE , 7 \nwhether  the resulting outcome is in the public interest depends upon the choices 8 \npresented. For example, if the Commission were forced to decide in some future 9 \nproceeding between continued ownership by Partners  that are no longer interested in 10 \nowning ALLETE and  a new prospective owner that may not be supportive of ALLETE’s  11 \ntransition to clean energy, there would be no good outcome  for ratepayers. If the 12 \nCommission rejected  the sale, it would be left with owners that may rather deploy equity 13 \ncapital to  their other companies than  to ALLETE. In this instance, there would be  14 \nnothing the Commission can do to require the Partners to continue to provide equity 15 \ncapital t o ALLETE. This creates a significant risk because should this Acquisition be 16 \napproved; ALLETE will be fully dependent on the Partners for access to equity capital.   17 \nQ Do the Partners commit to adhere to the current schedule for the Boswell coal unit 18 \nretirements ?   19 \nA No. The Par tners do not offer any commitments to adhere to the current schedule for 20 \nBoswell coal unit retirements. Witness Cady simply states that “ [n]either ALLETE’s 21 \ncurrent owners, nor the Partners if the Acquisition were approved, have the ability to 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n18 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 direct rate-recovered investments or power plant retirement dates without Commission 1 \napproval.”37   2 \nQ Does the need for Commission  approval address your concerns that the Partners  3 \ncould seek to delay  the Boswell coal unit retirement dates?  4 \nA No. Witness Cady’s  statement is purely semantics. Of course the Commission ultimately 5 \nhas the authority to approve requests for cost-recovery of investments and plant closures. 6 \nBut it would be wrong to suggest that Minnesota Power bears no responsibility for its 7 \nresource retirement decisions simply because those choices must ultimately be approved 8 \nby the Commission. The Company’s resource planning choices matter. The Company 9 \ncould drag its feet in developing replacement resources for Boswell, and then choose to 10 \nseek Commission approval to postpone the Boswell retirement dates after the Acquisition 11 \nis approved, or the Company  could work vigorously to ensure it has resources in pl ace to 12 \ncomply with the current retirement dates. A commitment by the Company not to seek to 13 \npostpone the Boswell coal retirement  dates would have meaningful value,  and the 14 \nCommission’s oversight authority does not excuse the Partners’ refusal to make that 15 \ncommitment.  16 \nIn Minnesota Power’s last IRP process, the Commission ordered that “Minnesota Power 17 \nmust cease coal operations at Boswell Unit 3 at the latest by December 31, 2029, and 18 \n                                                 \n37 Cady Rebuttal  at 12 :2-4. \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n19 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

Through this affirmation, the Applicants  don’t 13 \nactually commit to achieving the Carbon Free Standard, they only commit to “efforts to 14 \nachieve” the standard, which is not t he same thing . Putting in  effort does not guarantee an 15 \noutcome. Moreover, the level of effort can vary depending on the future priories of the 16 \nPartners.   17 \n                                                 \n38 In the Matter of Minn.

The Carbon Free Standard requires Minnesota 9 \nPower to supply Minnesota customers with carbon- free electricity equal to 80% of retail 10 \nsales by 2030, 90% by 2035, and 100% by 2040.43 If the Partners sell their shares in 11 \nALLETE  in 2029, th ey would not be responsible for whether or not Minnesota Power is 12 \nultimately able to comply with the 100% Carbon Free Standard in 2040.

The Company should have acknowledged in this proceeding (including in 4 \nrebuttal testimony) that the largest share of the Company’s proposed new resource 5 \nadditions in the 2025-2039 IRP are fossil fuels, and that fossil fuels make up a very 6 \nsigni ficant component of ALLETE’s 5- year capital plan.48 7 \nVI. THE ACQUISITION STILL LA CKS SUFFICIENT COMMI TMENTS TO 8 \nPROTECT LOCAL CONTRO L. 9 \nQ Please summarize the concerns raised in your D irect Testimony about the Partners’ 10 \ncontrol of ALLETE if the Acquisition is  approv ed. 11 \nA I explained in my D irect Testimony that the Partners would largely control the post- 12 \nAcquisition ALLETE Board of Directors (“ALLETE Board”), giving them significant 13 \ncontrol and influence over Minnesota Power’s business plans and budgets, which would 14 \nenable the Partners to direct investment (or over-investment) in capital, remove 15 \nuncooperative management, and change corporate strateg y.4916 \n48 ALLETE’s 2025-2029 capital plan provided in its 2024 Form 10-K includes $1,320 million in \nspending on “Base & Other” for regulated operations, plus an additional $230 million  on the \n600 MW gas-f ired Nemadji Trail Energy Center (“NTEC”) labeled as “South Shore Energy.” \nBy comparison, the 5-year capital plan includes $425 million for “Solar RFP,” $615 million \nfor “Wind RFP,” and $445 million for storage under regulated operations.

The Partners 10 \nstate that the ALLETE Board will have 13 voting directors. Of the two independent 11 \ndirectors  on the board, neither will be employed by the Partners or ALLETE.56 In total 12 \nthe Partners will appoint 10 of the 13 voting directors. CPP Investments would have 4 13 \ndirectors and GIP would have 6 total directors , with GIP Fund V appointing 4 members 14 \nand Tower Bridge appointing 2 members.57  15 \nLastly, Witness Alley responds that just because the Partners will own ALLETE and 16 \nselect the ALLETE Board members, “that does not mean that the Partners are goi ng to 17 \n                                                 \n53 Lane Direct (Public) at  28:5-9. \n54 Bram Rebuttal  at 41 :4-5. \n55 Id. at 41 :8-11.  \n56 Id. at 41 :15-18. \n57 Id. at 41 :20-23. \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n25 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

By contrast , other merger 11 \ncommitments in Cady Rebuttal Schedule 1 include specific commitment periods .  For 12 \nexample, the Applicants commit that “f or so  long as Minnesota Power is owned by the 13 \nPartners  … [ALLETE’s ] contributions to the Minnesota Power Foundation will not be 14 \nreduced. ”60 In addition, the Partners still do not commit to never influencing ALLETE 15 \nBoard decisions regarding who should be on Minne sota Power’s management team. 16 \nWhen asked in discovery if the Partners would commit to never influencing ALLETE 17 \n                                                 \n58 Alley Rebuttal at 35 :21-25. \n59 Id. \n60 Id. at 51:11-14. \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n26 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 VII. THE ACQUISITION WOULD STILL RESULT IN LES S TRANSPARENCY. 1 \nQ Briefly summarize your arguments about transparency.  2 \nA In my Direct Testimony, I argued that taking ALLETE private would deprive regulators 3 \nand the public of important insights into the Company’s operations and financial health, 4 \nprimarily because the private company would no longer need to report financial 5 \ninforma tion to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“ SEC”).64 6 \nQ Witness Anderson claims that the Company will already have to provide detailed 7 \ninformation to the Commission in proceedings such as IRP proceedings, and that 8 \nthese filings are more detailed than any SEC report.65 Does this argument alleviate 9 \nyour concerns?  10 \nA Not at all. This information discussed by Witness Anderson would all come at the 11 \noperating utility level. ALLETE would be under no obligation to provide detailed 12 \nfinancial information about its new p arents,  GIP and CPP. This lack of information could 13 \nharm the ability  of regulators and stakeholders to hold the new Company accountable to 14 \nthe public interest. For example, regulators and stakeholders would need parent- level 15 \nfinancial information to vet how long the Partners may be intending to hold ALLETE or 16 \ncertain ALLETE assets before a sale. SEC reporting could shed light on the parents ’ 17 \nfinancial situation , enabling  outside observers to judge when a sale may be forthcoming. 18 \nSuch reporting would not be available after the Acquisition is approved. 19 \n                                                 \n64 Lane Direct (Public) at 4 :11-15, 31:5-32:2 . \n65 Rebuttal Test imony of Colin Anderson (hereinafter, “Anderson Rebuttal”) at 11. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n28 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q Witness Lapson claims that “the reason that companies with publicly traded shares 1 \nare required to file financial reports is as a protection to investors, not to defend the 2 \ninterests of utility ratepayers against ‘profit- driven decisions.’”66 Do you agree with 3 \nWitness Lapson’s analy sis? 4 \nA No. These two purposes of SEC reporting are not mutually exclusive. It is true that SEC 5 \nreporting serves as a protection to investors. But it is nonetheless also true that 6 \ninformation found in such reports can also be used to defend ratepayer interests.  7 \nQ Witness Anderson states  that the Company will include in its annual capital 8 \nstructure petition “full audited consolidated financial statements” for Alloy 9 \nParent.67 Does that commitment alleviate your concerns about transparency?  10 \nA No. This commitme nt is not sufficient because it does not provide financial information 11 \nabout the Partners, GIP and CPP Investments . The Partners are the ultimate parents of 12 \nAlloy Parent . In order conduct robust oversight, for example, to assess when the Partners 13 \nmight be likely to sell ALLETE or certain ALLETE assets , regulators and stakeholders 14 \nwould need information on the ultimate parents, GIP and CPP, not just Alloy Parent. 15 \nVIII.  CONCLUSION  16 \nQ Please summarize your primary conclusions and recommendations.  17 \nA The Partners and  ALLE TE’s  rebuttal t estimony has failed to alleviate concerns raised by 18 \nmy D irect T estimony regarding  the Acquisition’s potential harms to the public interest 19 \nand has failed to demonstrate that the Acquisition is necessary.

Minnesota Power’s last remaining source of baseload capable generation – the \nBEC – continues to play a critical role in providing reliable energy to residents, businesses, and \nthe unique industries that operate in northern Minnesota. As Minnesota Power advances its cease \ncoal plan at BEC Unit 3 (“BEC3”) and BEC Unit 4 (“BEC4”), reliable fuel source alternatives are \nnecessary before the Company can transition from existing coal generation. An innovative and \nnew approach to ensuring reliability was integrated into the planning process with the addition of \n“reliability criteria” designed to monitor and inform planning decisions. Minnesota Power is \ncommitted to replacing coal and has identified natural gas as the cleanest, most reliable, flexible, \nand least cost option to replace nearly 1,000 MW of baseload generation supported by BEC3 and \nBEC4 in order to continue providing 24/7 electricity service to Minnesota Power’s customers. \nAccordingly, to meet the Company’s existing customer load, the 2025 Plan calls for the refuel of \nBEC3 with natural gas by 2030 and the immediate development of combined cycle natural gas \ngeneration to replace power removed at the cease coal dates for Minnesota Power customers by \n2035 for BEC4. Additionally, the 2025 Plan incorporates future customer-driven activities like \nenergy conservation and demand response, as well as additional investigation into biomass as a \nfuel source to support dispatchable and baseload energy needs.  \nSustainability \nThe 2025 Plan offers bold next steps and necessary actions required to advance additional \ncarbon reductions and complying with Minnesota’s CFS while also considering the social and \neconomic needs of Minnesota Power’s customers and communities. The electric system must \ncontinue to provide increasingly sustainable and reliable sources of electricity that meets the \nnecessary physical criteria to protect customers. The Company continues to make progress on \nits 2021 Plan, including approximately 200 MW of additional utility-scale solar, approximately 65 \nto 85 MW of DG solar additions, up to 400 MW of additional wind energy, and up to 500 MWh of \nnew energy storage, by 2030 or sooner.  \nThe 2025 Plan will result in the Company providing a transition to a coal-free power supply \nand, along with the cleaner natural gas support identified above, will include up to an additional \n400 MW of wind energy, at least 100 MW of enhanced industrial demand response with economic \ncurtailments, and 100 MW of energy storage by 2035. The 2025 Plan calls for continued \noperations at the HREC and will explore additional biomass investments as a future solid fuel \nalternative. This exploration will be based on the outcome of the Commission proceeding to \ndevelop a Life-Cycle Analysis (“LCA”) for biomass to be utilized as a carbon-free fuel source in \ncompliance with the CFS and ongoing consultation with Tribal Nations and other stakeholders. \nThis IRP represents an iterative planning approach and the 2025 Plan, if approved, will deliver an \nannual energy portfolio that is 80 percent carbon-free by 2030 and pave the path to deliver 90 \npercent carbon-free energy by 2035. Furthermore, the 2025 Plan results in 95 percent carbon \nreductions from 2005 levels.  \nThe pursuit of cleaner technologies and evolution are paramount as we move forward. While \nnot all technology is commercially available for full grid deployment at this time, the Company \nmaintains its commitment to work with customers to support ongoing development of carbon \nminimizing alternatives. In the 2025 Plan, the Company has proposed a research and \nMinnesota Power’s 2025-2039 Integrated Resource Plan Page 25 \nSection II. 2025 Resource Plan Summary approved utility planning framework. Supported by the information and analysis in the appendices \nof this IRP, the actions outlined in the following sections identify both short- and long-term steps \nthat will help Minnesota Power continue to meet customer needs near term (over the next five \nyears) and be poised to deliver safe and reliable service to customers for many years to come. \nShort-Term Action Plan (2025 through 2030)  \nMinnesota Power’s short-term action plan during the five-year period of 2025 through 2030 \nis comprised of steps that will immediately reduce carbon emissions in the near term and continue \nthe addition of carbon-free energy renewables, conservation, and other demand side resources \nto the Company’s resource portfolio. The specific strategic and necessary actions to achieve \nthese steps include: \n Complete the 2021 IRP actions already in progress, including finalizing the Company’s \nimplementation plan for 400 MW of new wind energy by 2028 and completing the \nimplementation of the Regal Solar Project and the Boswell Solar Project, which will result \nin an approximately 200 MW of additional utility-scale solar resources. The Company will \nalso bring forward a filing outlining the Company’s plan for up to 500 MWh of new energy \nstorage in 2026 and progress on IDP non-wires alternatives.  \n Maximize demand side management and customer options by continuing the Company’s \nECO and energy efficiency programs and creating the necessary tariff mechanisms to \nacquire at least 100 MW of new long-term demand response capacity by 2028 that \nincludes an annual energy curtailment requirement. The Company will also work to \ncomplete the addition of 65 to 85 MW of new DG solar resources and implement an EV \nmulti-dwelling unit (“MDU”) program to further support customers’ electrification needs. \n Add new renewable energy to the Company’s portfolio by releasing an RFP for 400 MW \nof additional wind energy and 100 MW of energy storage for implementation by 2035. \n Advance the Company’s plan to cease coal at BEC3 by 2030 by beginning the \nengineering and acquisition of materials required for a natural gas refuel of the unit. \nPending the outcome of state and federal regulatory processes and economic \nevaluations related to biomass as a net carbon-free resource, Minnesota Power will \nconduct additional investigation into the economic prospects of co-firing biomass as part \nof the refuel plan at BEC. The Company will cease coal at BEC3 once new gas refuel \ncapability is in service. This refueling will result in an immediate carbon emissions \nreduction while supporting reliability in the region and continuing to provide economic \nbenefits for the local host community. \n In order to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Section 111(d) \ncarbon regulations, begin development and engineering required for at least a 40 percent \nnatural gas capability for BEC4, in coordination with WPPI Energy.  \n Continue operations at HREC to support regional reliability needs and ensure all \nenvironmental requirements are met for this renewable facility.  \n Work with customers to integrate emerging clean firm technology with a proposal \nrequesting $30 million to pursue R&D projects that will be rider recoverable. \nLong-Term Action Plan (2030 through 2039) \nMinnesota Power will focus its long-term action plan on a strategy to further reduce carbon \nemissions in its portfolio and reshape its generation mix after it ceases utilizing coal. This long-\nterm strategy will continue resource diversification and position Minnesota Power to be able to \nMinnesota Power’s 2025-2039 Integrated Resource Plan Page 68 \nSection V. 2025 Plan Development Since 2015, through operational optimization and capital investments, the minimum dispatch level \non BEC3 and BEC4 have been reduced. Since the last IRP, Minnesota Power implemented a \nproject at BEC3 that reduced the minimum dispatch level from 175 MW down to 75 MW. These \nactions to improve the flexibility of the fleet have opened new opportunities for utilizing existing \nassets at BEC3 to co-locate solar. Minnesota Power is requesting approval from the Commission \nto add 85 MW of solar that will share interconnection service with BEC3, requiring the unit to \ndecrease generation during the day to make room for solar energy to go onto the grid. This is a \ngreat example of Minnesota Power’s foresight to invest in improving flexibility, creating an \nopportunity to add cost effective solar to meet the CFS, and directly reducing carbon emissions \nby allowing for additional renewable energy to flow onto the system.  \nIn the IRP analysis, Minnesota Power screened two alternative fuel options at BEC3 to \ncontinue producing energy after ceasing coal operations by 2030, along with a retirement \nscenario. This included refueling the boiler with 100 percent natural gas or co-firing with biomass \nand natural gas. Both refueling alternatives would require a capital investment to install the natural \ngas capability or retrofit the existing coal handling system to handle biomass. The capital \ninvestment for the biomass option also includes costs for a biomass palletization facility on site \nthat would take regional biomass and convert it to pellets that can be used in the boiler. The 100 \npercent gas refuel option also included a reduction in O&M due to fewer staff needed to operate \na natural gas fired steam unit. A concern with refuel is that the large peaking asset would have \nlong lead time startup operations in comparison to modern combustion turbines, although the \nCompany believes that is manageable with the recommendation to refuel one BEC unit on 100 \npercent natural gas in the 2025 Plan. The need for flexible and dispatchable generation will \ncontinue to be evaluated in future IRPs as Minnesota Power prepares to meet the CFS. \nThe Capacity Expansion Analysis demonstrates that refueling BEC3 is a least cost option for \ncustomers versus retirement and replacing BEC3 with new gas generation. Furthermore, with \nMinnesota Power showing a growing capacity need with ceasing coal operations and in the +1100 \nMW Growth Scenario, BEC3 cannot be retired prior to replacement generation with similar \noperational characteristics being brought online. With a commitment to cease coal by 2030, it \nwould be challenging or impossible to have replacement generation online given the Company’s \nrecent experience with permitting the NTEC project. Refueling by co-firing with biomass and \nnatural gas shows economic promise, especially if biomass receives net carbon-free treatment \nthrough a life-cycle analysis to qualify for the PTC and CFS. Unfortunately, the requirements for \nperforming a life-cycle analysis on biomass have not been finalized at the federal and state level, \ncreating uncertainty on the viability of biomass in the future. \nThere are regional environmental benefits accompanying ceasing coal operation and \nrefueling BEC3 with natural gas. With coal no longer needed to operate BEC3, there will be less \ncoal handling occurring onsite, along with less rail cars delivering coal to the facility. The trickle-\ndown impact to operations will also affect ash handling, where the transportation activities and \nstorage of ash will cease. Although there are environmental benefits to the reduced coal and ash \nhandling, the jobs associated with these activities will be negatively impacted. Minnesota Power \nwill work with any affected employees and the union on a transition plan if the refueling of BEC3 \nwith natural gas is approved. \nFor the reasons stated above, Minnesota Power is recommending in the 2025 Plan additional \ninvestigation, including submitting a life-cycle analysis for biomass to be utilized as a net-carbon \nfree source to meet the Minnesota CFS. If net-carbon free status is achieved for biomass and this \nrefuel option continues to show economic benefits for customers, Minnesota Power will submit \nnecessary permitting to advance the ability to co-fire biomass at BEC3. In the short-term action \nplan, the 2025 Plan recommends the Company begin engineering and acquisition of necessary \nMinnesota Power’s 2025-2039 Integrated Resource Plan Page 69 \nSection V. 2025 Plan Development materials for a 100 percent natural gas refuel of BEC3. Note that this 100 percent natural gas \nrefuel recommendation meets the requirements of the EPA’s Section 111(d) carbon regulations. \nAn outcome of the 2021 IRP was a requirement for Minnesota Power to evaluate the \nconversion of BEC3 to a synchronous condenser upon retirement. A study was performed to \ndetermine the feasibility of converting BEC3 to a synchronous condenser, for both seasonal \noperation and following unit retirement. The study found it is technically feasible to convert the \nunit to synchronous condenser operation. However, the length of time needed to switch between \ngenerating and synchronous condenser operating modes makes conversion infeasible until unit \nretirement. Because the 2025 Plan includes a BEC3 refuel with natural gas, Minnesota Power \nrecommends taking no action on converting BEC3 to a synchronous condenser and will continue \nto consider the option in future IRPs. Appendix F contains additional information on the \nsynchronous condenser conversion study.  \nBEC4 \nBEC4 will be one of the last baseload operating units in northern Minnesota after BEC3 \nceases coal operations in 2030. As approved in the 2021 IRP, the Company continues to be \ncommitted to ceasing coal-fired operations for its customers in 2035. Like BEC3, BEC4 is an \neconomic capacity and energy resource for customers and is well controlled for emissions. The \nCompany continues to take actions as needed to prepare a transition to economic dispatch in a \nsimilar manner as BEC3 operates today.  Action can be taken if it is economical for customers \nand regional reliability of the system can be maintained with no dispatchable generation online in \nnorthern Minnesota. BEC4 is jointly owned with WPPI Energy and any changes will be \ncoordinated with this co-owner, including moving to economic dispatch, remission, or retirement. \nMinnesota Power will continue to work closely with its partner on future plans at BEC4. \nThe IRP analysis evaluated multiple refuel options and retirement at the 2035 cease coal \ndate for BEC4. The refuel options evaluated are a 40 percent natural gas refuel by 2030 or co-\nfiring with biomass and natural gas by 2035. Per the EPA Section 111(d) carbon regulation \nrequirements, BEC4 cannot continue to operate exclusively on coal through 2035 and additional \naction is required for Section 111(d) compliance. One option per the EPA regulation is to refuel \nBEC4 to 40 percent natural gas by 2030. Given the demonstrated need for capacity and energy \nin 2030, and the inability to feasibly add new generation in this timeframe, Minnesota Power is \nrecommending in the 2025 Plan to take action at BEC4 to prepare the unit for compliance with \nSection 111(d) by starting the engineering and acquisition of necessary materials for a 40 percent \nnatural gas refuel by 2030. The Company is monitoring litigation of the final Section 111 rules, \nwhich is proceeding in federal court. Outcomes from ongoing litigation may impact both the timing \nof rule effectiveness and the ultimate compliance obligations required by the rule. If this rule is \nvacated through legal proceedings, remanded by the new federal administration, or replaced with \na new federal carbon regulation, Minnesota Power will re-evaluate this recommendation and \nprovide an update in the next IRP. \nIn the 2021 IRP, the Commission ordered Minnesota Power in its next IRP to “…continue to \nevaluate additional transmission system reliability mitigations needed to maintain the option of \nretiring the Boswell facility entirely, including unit 4, by no later than 2030.”  Minnesota Power \ncontinues to make progress on transmission system upgrades to strengthen the system for \nconsidering a BEC retirement. Please refer to Appendix F for further discussions on the significant \nprojects that are in progress. The limiting constraint on potentially removing BEC4 as early as \n2030 is a power supply reliability concern along with the infeasibility to add new generation in that \ntimeframe to replace such a large component of capacity and dispatchable energy for customers. \nTherefore, this IRP studied an earliest retirement date for customers of 2035 for BEC4.  \nATTACHMENT CL S-2 \nExcerpt from ALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K  (February 13, \n2025) \nUnited States\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nForm 10-K\n(Mark One)\n ☒ Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n         For the year ended December 31, 2024  \n☐ Transition Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nFor the transition period from ______________ to ______________\nCommission File Number 1-3548\nALLETE, Inc.\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)\nMinnesota  41-0418150\n(State or other jurisdiction of incorporation or or ganization)  (I.R.S.

For 30 years of my working life I helped\nensure that the customers of Allete were provided with reliable, cost effective power for their homesand businesses. I am opposed to the sale of Allete as I fear any new owner will not live up to the companiesobligations with regard to pensions and medical for their retirees. There are too many horror storiesof companies being bought out, pension plans raided and retirees left behind with little or no meansof support.Many of us spent our entire working lives dedicated to ensure that Allete achieve the excellentrecord of customer service and reliability that they presently have. During those working years weaccepted lower compensation knowing that we would instead have a reliable source of income in ourlater years. We are now in those later years, in our 70's, 80's and 90's, and no longer have the optionof full time employment to meet our needs. Should Allete be sold and the feared scenario occur, not only would we retirees would suffer severehardship, but, the negative message sent to future employees could well affect the ability of Allete toprovide that cost effective, reliable energy that Northern Minnesota has enjoyed for more than 100years."

Capital Expenditures in Witness Taran’s Direct Testimony:  \nThe five-year capital expenditure forecast presented in Witness Taran’s Direct Testimony \n(Figure 1) was prepared in February of 2024 (the most recent available forecast at the time \ntestimony was prepared), and is consistent with the regulated capital expenditure forecast \n(including South Shore Energy) set forth in ALLETE’s 2023 Form 10-K and Exhibit L to the \nCompany’s 2024 Capital Structure Petition for the 2024–2028 time period. However, the 2023 \n10-K and the 2024 Capital Structure Petition present consolidated ALLETE projected capital \nexpenditures whereas Witness Taran’s Direct Testimony presents regulated capital \nexpenditures. \n2. Capital Expenditures in Witness Taran’s Rebuttal Testimony: \nThe five-year capital expenditure forecast presented in Witness Taran’s Rebuttal Testimony \n(Table 1) was prepared in February of 2025, and was updated to align with the regulated \namounts (including South Shore Energy) included in ALLETE’s 2024 Form 10-K and Exhibit \nL to the Company’s 2025 Capital Structure Petition for the 2025–2029 time period. However, \nthe 2024 10-K and the 2025 Capital Structure Petition present consolidated ALLETE projected \ncapital expenditures whereas Witness Taran’s Rebuttal Testimony presents regulated capital \nexpenditures. \n \n3. Consideration of the 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (“2025 IRP”): \nThe resource needs identified in the Company’s 2025 IRP primarily concern resource \nrequirements beyond the aforementioned time horizons. As such, at this time the 2025 IRP \ndoes not change the Company’s capital forecasts through 2029, which are largely \nimplementing the Company’s prior IRP. The Company intends to address future needs within \nthe IRP proceeding itself, which will include input from all parties and stakeholders and \nultimately require  Commission approval.  \nIN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF MINNESOTA \nPOWER FOR ACQUISITION OF ALLETE  BY \nCANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD \nAND GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS  \n MPUC  DOCKET NO.

Both assets currently have a 35% debt to ca pitalization ratio which \nis consistent with their historical capitalization. We have summarized the filed capital structure \nfrom the Columbia Gas Transmission rate cases from 2020 and 2024 below.  \n \n \n \nIn addition, GIP currently holds a 25% interest in Scotia Gas Networks (“SGN”), which is the \nsecond largest gas utility in the United Kingdom with assets in both England and Scotland, serving \napproximately 6 million customers. GIP invested in SGN through s eparately managed accounts in \nMarch 2022. The applicable leverage metric to regulators of SGN in the relevant jurisdiction is the \n“Net Debt to Regulated Asset Value.” The most recent data available demonstrates that SGN’s \ntwo regulated gas distribution net works, Scotland Gas Networks and Southern Gas Networks, \nleverage at the utility has decreased since GIP’s acquisition:  \n \n2021  \nSouthern Gas Networks: 70.1%  \nScotland Gas Networks: 71.0%  \n 2024  \nSouthern Gas Networks: 65.2%  \nScotland Gas Networks: 62.2%  \nWhile GIP holds a number of other regulated infrastructure portfolio companies, those companies \ndo not operate with a regulated asset base model that would provide a basis for comparison of \ncapital structure.   \n \nThere are no regulated utilities where GIP previously had, but no longer has, an ownership \ninterest of 40% or more.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nRyan P.

    "content": "Approved by  the ALLETE \nBoard of Directors on October 23, 2024  \nALLETE, Inc.  \nCorporate Governance Guidelines  \nThese Corporate Governance Guidelines (the \"Guidelines\") have been adopted by the ALLETE (the \n“Company) Board of Directors (“Board” or “Directors”) to assist the Board in performing its duties and \nexercising its responsibilities. The Guidelines are subject to periodic review and modification by the Board.  \nD\nIRECTOR RESPONSIBILITIES  \nD\nirectors  have a responsibility to exercise their business judgment to act in what they reasonably \nbelieve to be in the best interests of the Company, its shareholders, customers, employees, and communities.   \nTh\ne Board expects the following from each Director: (a) to understand ALLETE's businesses and the \nmarketplaces in which they operate; (b) to prepare for and attend Board meetings and meetings of any committee on which they serve; (c) to monitor and keep in formed about ALLETE’s performance,  general \neconomic, business , and management news , trends, and developments; (e) to constructively engage in \nthe strategic decision making processes; (f) to share their perspective, background, experience, knowledge , and insights  as they  relate to the matters before the Board and its committees; and (g) to be \nreasonably available when requested to advise the CEO and Company executives on specific issues not requiring the attention of the full Board, but where an individual Director's insights might be helpful to the CEO or executive officers.  \nB\nOARD ORGANIZATION AND COMPOSITION  \nB\noard Leadership  \nThe Board believes the  issue of separation of the offices of Chair and Chief Executive Officer is part of \nthe succession planning process , and that it is in the best interest of the Company for the Board to make \na determination when it annually elects its Chair for the upcoming year.   \nI\nf the Board Chair is not an Independent Director, the Independent Directors will select an Independent \nDirector to serve as \"Lead Director\".   \nS\nize of the Board  \nThe Board believes that its size should range from nine to fifteen Directors as provided in the Articles of Incorporation. The Board will periodically evaluate its size in light of changes in the Company’s size, nature , and complexity and may change the specific number of Directors constituting the Board by \nresolution.  \nD\nirector Independence  \nA substantial majority of the Board’s Directors  shall be independent .  Except in unusual circumstances, \nno more than two Company executive officers should serve on the Board at the same time.  \nI\nn accordance with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) director independence standards , no Director \nshall qualify as “independent” unless the Board affirmatively determines that the Director has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with  the Company). The Corporate Governance and Nominating \nCommittee shall provide recommendations to the Board with respect to whether each  individual \nExhibit DOC-305\n \nPage 2 of 9 \n    \n Director is independent, and the Board shall review and make an affirmative determination of each \nDirector’s independence.  The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board shall \nconsider all relevant facts and circumstances in making independence recommendations and \nindependence determination s.  In addition, the Board has adopted certain categorical standard s to \nassist in determining a Director’s independence.  A “material relationship” with the Company exists and \na Director is not independent if any of the following applies : \n \n1. The Director is or has been employed by the Company within the last three years  (other than as \na former  interim  Chair or a former interim CEO ); or the Director’s  immediate family  member  is \nor has been employed by the  Company within the last three years as an executive officer . \n \n2. The Director has received, or the Director has an immediate family member who has received , \nduring any 12- month period in any of the last three years , more than $120,000 in direct  \ncompensation from the Company ( other than Director and committee fees, pension , or other \nforms of deferred compensation for prior service so long as such compensation is not contingent on continued service ); \n \n3. The Director is a current partner or employee of a firm that is the Company’s current \nindependent registered public accounting firm; the Director has an immediate family member who is a current partner of the Company’s current independent registered public accounting firm; the Director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of the Company’s current independent registered public accounting firm and who personally works on the Company’s audit;  or the Director or an immediate family member was, within the last three \nyears , a partner or employee of the Company’s current independent registered public \naccounting firm and personally worked on the Company’s audit within that time .   \n \n4. The Director or an immediate family member is or has been , within the last three years , \nemployed as an executive officer of another company where any of the Company’s present executive officers at the same time serves or served on that company’s compensation committee.  \n \n5. The Director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive \nofficer, of a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, the Company for \nproperty or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds  the greater \nof $1 million or two percent  of such other company’s consolidated gross revenues . \n \n6. The Director or an immediate family member has been an executive officer of a foundation, \nuniversity, non -profit trust , or other tax-exempt charitable organization, within the last three \nyears, for which contributions from the Company and its respective trusts or foundations, \naccount or accounted for more tha n the greater of $ 1 million  or two percent  of such charitable \norganization’s consolidated gross revenue.  \n Nomination  Process, Principles , and Values  \nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews , at least annually,  the skills, expertise, \nand attributes that are important for effective governance for the Company and to its strategy .  The \nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee, in consultation with the Board Chair, will be \nresponsible for identifying, screening, interviewing, and recommending candidates to the entire Board.  \nAny potential nominee should be interviewed by a maj ority of the Corporate Governance and \nNominating Committee’s members.  The Board may engage a search firm to assist in identifying and \nconducting due diligence on potential Director nominees.  \n \nPage 3 of 9 \n    \n  \nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider any person proposed by a Director, management, a search firm, or any shareholder.  The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the candidate’s independence in accordance wi th these ALLETE Corporate Governance \nGuidelines and the NYSE and Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC) rules.   The invitation to join the \nBoard should be extended on behalf of the Board by the Board Chair, together with the Corporate Governance and Nomi nating Committee Chair.  \n The Board recognizes that its success depends on not only the individual capabilities of the Directors, but also on its collective strengths. It further recognizes the importance of a well -balanced Board, \nreflecting the Company's shareholders, customers, employees, and the communities it serves .  In \nselecting Director nominees, the Board considers the following factors, including:  integrity, qualifications, diversity, age, skills, experience, independence , commitment to sustainability as outlined \nin the AL LETE Corporate Sustainability Report , how the candidate’s relevant experience would \ncomplement and enhance the composition of the Board, Board succession plans, the candidate’s ability \nand willingness to devote adequate time to Board duties, and the likelihood that such candidate will be \nwilling and able to serve on the Board for a sustained period , in addition to using such other criteria and \npriorities established from time to time . \n \nDirectors serve for a one -year term, continuing until their successors are elected or until their earlier \ndeath, resignation, retirement, disqualification, or removal. There are no limits on the number of terms a Director may serve. The Board believes the Company benefits from the contributions of Directors who have developed, over time, increasing insight into the Company.  \n \nDirector Resignation  \nIn an uncontested election, any nominee for Director who receives a greater number of votes \n\"withheld\" from their  election than votes \"for\" such election shall promptly offer to tender their  \nresignation to the Board following certification of the shareholder vote. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the \noffer, or whether other action should be taken. The Boa rd shall act on whether to accept the D irector's \noffer, taking into account the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by press rel ease, a filing with the SEC , or other broadly disseminated means of \ncommunication) its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days after the date of the certification \nof the election results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, in making its \nrecommendation, and  the Board, in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other \nrecommendations that it considers relevant and appropriate. The incumbent Director who offers to \ntender their  resignation shall not participate in the Bo ard's decision. If such incumbent Director's offer \nto tender their resignation is not accepted by the Board, the Director shall continue to serve for the \ncurrent term.  \n \nAny executive officer (including the CEO) who is a Director will resign from the Board at the same time they discontinue active management responsibilities with the Company or cease to hold the position they held at the time the last Proxy Statement was ma iled to shareholders in connection with the \nelection of Directors, unless, in either case, the Board requests them to continue as a Director.  \n Director Retirement  \nIt is the Board’s policy that no person may stand for election to the Board after age 72.  However, the Board may waive this policy for a period of up to two years if it determines that an individual’s unique capabilities and/or special circumstances make such waiver in the best interests of the Company and its \nshareholders.  \n \nPage 4 of 9 \n    \n  \nChange of Position  \nEach Director shall offer to tender their resignation to the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee upon the occurrence of the following:  \n• Resignation, retirement, or termination of the Director’s principal employment or other significant change in the Director’s professional occupation or association;  \n• If currently serving on a public company Board of Directors and such service ends  other than as \na result of a planned retirement or a mandatory retirement age requirement . \n The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall consider the resignation offer and recommend to the Board whether the Director should be asked to resign. The Board as a whole will determine whether or not such Director will continue as a member of the Board.  \n Conflict of Interest  \nDirectors must disclose circumstances material to the Director that are or might be perceived as a conflict of interest. These circumstances include those situations where a Director and an executive officer have a material financial interest in a common e ntity. If an actual or potential conflict of interest \ndevelops because of a change in the business of the Company or a subsidiary, or a change in a Director’s circumstances, the Director should disclose the matter to the Corporate Governance and Nominating  \nCommittee. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall review any conflict of interest in consultation with the Board Chair and Lead Director, if applicable, and provide the requesting Director \nwith a determination.  If a Director has a person al interest in a matter before the Board, the interest \nshall be disclosed to the full Board, and the Director shall recuse themsel f from participation in the \ndiscussion and shall not  vote on the matter.  \n \nService on Other Boards  \nThe Board believes they  should limit the number of boards on which they serve in order to give proper \nattention to their responsibility to each board. Directors will inform the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of any nomination for membership on other for -profit boards (or similar \ngoverning bodies) and obtain approval before accepting such membership. The Corporate Governance \nand Nominating Committee will review the requirements of such membership with the Director before \ngranting or withholdin g approval. The Board believes that Directors should limit their service to not \nmore than three other boards of public companies , but exceptions to this policy will be made in \nappropriate cases. Directors may not serve on boards of associations or organizations with policies or \nstrategies contrary to the Company’s strategy or business. Where a Director seeks to serve on more than th ree other boards, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the \nrequest and submit its recommendation to the Board for consideration and decision. All memberships \non other boards by the CEO will be considered and decided by the full Board based upon the Corporate \nGovernance and Nominating Committee’s recommendation.  \n \n \nPage 5 of 9 \n    \n Service on Boards of Competing or Interlocking Enterprises  \nA Director will not serve as a D irector of any public company that competes with the Company’s \nbusinesses. Federal law regulates so -called \"interlocking\" directorates; and other restrictions are \nimposed where two or more Directors of the Company serve together on another board or similar body. \nDirectors should seek legal guidance concerning such memberships. There are additional limitations \nimposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission relating to participants in and  suppliers to the \nenergy market.  \n BOARD OPERATIONS  \n Board Meetings and Schedule  \n The Board will hold at least four regular meetings each year.  The Board Chair will prepare and propose a Board meeting schedule for the ensuing year for consideration by the Board at its first meeting following \nthe Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  \n \nExtended Meeting  \nOne of the Board’s meetings, usually the October meeting, will be scheduled over an extended period to permit detailed review of the Company’s strategic plan.    Executive Sessions  \nAt each regularly scheduled meeting, the non -employee  Independent Directors will meet in Executive \nSession  for discussion without management present . These meetings will be chaired either by the Board \nChair or by the Lead Director (if the Board Chair is not an Independent Director ).  \n Meeting Materials  \nIn advance of each regular Board meeting, an agenda will be sent electronically to each Director together with: (a) written materials pertaining to certain matters to be presented for Board decision at such meeting; (b) summary of financial information nee ded to understand the performance of the \nCompany; (c) minutes of the most recent Board meeting and of any committee meetings held since the distribution of materials for the most recent Board meeting; and (d) other written materials that are available in advance of the meeting. Written materials should be designed to provide a foundation for \nthe Board's discussion of key issues and allow the Board to make the most efficient use of its meeting \ntime. Directors may request additional information or changes in the scope, amount , or format of the \ninformation provided, and the CEO will make every effort to provide such additional information or make such changes.  \n BOARD COMMITTEES  \nThe Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Executive Compensation  and \nHuman Capital Committee, and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which also \nserves the functions of an executive committee. Each committee will be chaired by an Independent Director and will have only Independent Directors as members. The Board Chair (if an Independent \nDirector) or Lead Director is an ex -officio  member of each of the standing committees.  Each standing \ncommittee will have a charter th at is adopted by the Board , and each Committee will establish a \nschedule of standing agenda items to be discussed during the year . In general, the committees should \nfunction to identify and focus  on issues for discussion by the full  Board. Each committee chair shall \nreport regularly to the Board on committee meetings and other committee activities.  \n The membership and chairs of the committees will be rotated from time -to-time after considering the \nrecommendations of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to allow Directors to serve \n \nPage 6 of 9 \n    \n on various committees over time while providing for continuity of membership and leadership on each \ncommittee. The Board recognizes that rotating chairs provides development for the Directors and allows a variety of perspectives in leadership positions.  I t is the sense of the Board that committee chairs \nshould rotate approximately every five years. Any Director and the CEO may participate in any \ncommittee meeting except when such participation would present a conflict of interest or, in the case of \na Board  Chair who is not an Independent Director, if the meeting is an executive session. In the absence \nof the Committee chair, the most senior Committee members (in terms of Committee service) will chair the Committee meeting.  \n Committee Meeting Materials  \nThe chair of each committee will oversee the preparation of an agenda for each meeting. The agenda will be provided to each committee member in advance , together with: (a) written materials pertaining \nto the matters to be presented for consideration at such meeting; and (b) the minutes of the most recent meeting of the committee.  \n \nManagement Attendance at Committee Meetings  \nThe chair of each committee in consultation with the CEO will determine which members of \nManagement will attend each committee meeting.  \n \nOther Committees  \nThe Board may form ad hoc committees from time to time. The Board will determine the size, \nmembership, and chair of each ad hoc committee. Generally, the chairs and most members of such \ncommittees will be Independent Directors. The Board may appoint members of Management as ex officio  members of such ad hoc committees.   \n \nGENERAL MATTERS  \n \nBoard and Committee Evaluations  \nEach year, the Board and its c ommittees  undertake self -evaluations.  The Board’s self- evaluation \nincludes soliciting opinions from the Directors about topics related to Board effectiveness, including:  the sufficiency and timeliness of briefing materials provided to them; the content and conduc t of \nmeetings; the adequacy of time allocated to , and quality of, presentations and discussions; access to \nmanagement; the Board’s understanding of issues; Board’s consideration of shareholders’ interests in making decisions; overall characteristics and mix of skill sets of Board members; as well as other areas. \nThese assessments are used to improve Board performance and effectiveness.   \n \nEach Board committee’s self- evaluation addresses matters the committee considers relevant to its \nperformance, including a review and assessment of the committee’s charter.  A report on each committee’s self -evaluation is presented to the Board.  \n Director orientation and continuing education  \nAll new Directors participate in an orientation program with respect to the duties and responsibilities of \nthe Board.  Each Board committee also provides new committee members with appropriate background information about the workings of the committee.   \n Directors are expected to participate in relevant educational opportunities at least every other year to enhance their effectiveness on the Board. The Company will pay for courses Directors deem appropriate to help them in their role as Board members.  \n CEO Evaluation  \n \nPage 7 of 9 \n    \n Each year, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will develop and recommend to the \nBoard criteria that will be used to evaluate the CEO's performance. These criteria will include, among \nother things, the Company's performance against its strategic and op erating plans, as well as \nachievements in management development and succession planning. The Corporate Governance and \nNominating Committee or its nominee will solicit input from each of the Independent Directors \nregarding the CEO's performance and share the results of its evaluation with the Board's Independent Directors. The Executive Compensation  and Human Capital Committee will set financial goals and \nobjectives related to the CEO’s compensation and, based on the performance evaluation conducted by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the results achieved relative to the goals and objectives, set the CEO’s compensation. After discussion and approval by the Independent \nDirectors, the Lead Director or the Board Chair (if they are  an Independent Director) and the Executive \nCompensation  and Human Capital Committee Chair, if invited by the Lead Director, will meet with the \nCEO to discuss the evaluation.  \n \nDirector Compensation  \nThe Board determine s Director compensation. Any Director who is also employed by the Company will \nreceive no additional compensation for their  service as a Director. The Board believes that it is \nimportant to align Directors’ interests with those of Company shareholders. Accordingly, the Board \nbelieves that a significant portion of Directors' compensation should be paid in stock or other forms o f \ncompensation that correlate with the Company’s market value. Management will report annually to the Executive Compensation  and Human Capital  Committee on the amount and composition of the \ncompensation of the Company's Directors in relation to the compens ation of directors of comparable \nenterprises. The Executive Compensation  and Human Capital Committee will recommend changes in \nDirectors’ compensation to the Board.  \n Directors' and Officers’ Share Ownership  \nThe Board believes that the Directors and officers should be Company shareholders  and that such equity \nownership aligns the Directors’ and officers’ interests with those of the Company shareholders.  Accordingly, the Board has adopted share ownership guidelines, as established by t he Corporate \nGovernance and Nominating Committee , for share ownership by Directors and officers it designates as \ninsiders for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Section 16 Officers”).  The CEO has the discretion to establish and modify guidelines for other Company officers.  \n The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has determined that Directors should own at \nleast 500 shares of Company stock prior to their election as a Director and, within five years of such \nelection, shares valued at not less than five times the Dir ectors’ annual cash retainer.  Directors are \nexpected to continue to hold shares in accordance with these guidelines for their entire tenure on the Board.  \n \nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has determined that Section 16 Officers should \nown shares of Company stock valued at not less than various multiples of their respective base salary ranging from five times base salary to one times base salary. Section 16 Officers are expected to attain share ownership in accordance with their guidelines within seven years of first being subject to the guidelines, or, in cases in which Section 16 Officers are newly subject to a higher share ownership \nguideli ne (e.g., due to promotion, an upward adjustment in the guideline for positions , etc.), within five \nyears of the being subject to the new guideline.  Section 16 Officers are expected to continue to hold \nshares in accordance with their applicable guideline for so long as they hold the title position.  \n \n \nPage 8 of 9 \n    \n The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may reduce the share ownership guideline for a \nDirector or Section 16 Officer following a publicly announced plan to retire or in other circumstances the Committee deems appropriate.  \n \nBoard Contact with Management and Independent Advisors  \nExecutive officers and other members of management are included in open sessions of the Board and \nCommittee meetings, as appropriate. Directors may, from time to time, meet individually with the Company’s executive officers or other management. Normally, t he CEO should be informed of such \nmeetings in advance and, following such meetings, informed of the matters discussed during and results \nof any such meetings. Directors should use their access to Company management employees with care \nso as not to undermin e normal lines of authority. Directors shall have access to independent advisors \nretained by the Board as it deems necessary and appropriate.  \n Code of B usiness Conduct  \nALLETE  has adopted a Code of Business Conduct  (which serves as an ethics policy ) that applies to all \nDirectors, officers, and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Board and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee have oversight of integrity at the Company, and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall r eview the ethics policy from time to time and \nrecommend any proposed changes to the Board.  \n Management Development and Succession Planning \nPlanning for CEO succession and overseeing the identification and development of executive talent are primary Board responsibilities. The Board oversees executive officer development and succession plans for the CEO and other executive officers to provide for continuity in senior management. This effort is \nled by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee with active input from the CEO and the \nCompany’s human resources department.  \n The Board works with the CEO to plan for CEO succession. The CEO succession plan covers identification of internal candidates, development plans for internal candidates, and , as appropriate , identification of \nexternal candidates. The Board annually reviews the CEO succession plan. The criteria used to assess potential CEO candidates are formulated based on the Company’s business strategies and include strategic vision, leadership, and operational execution.  \n The Board maintains an emergency succession contingency plan should an unforeseen event (such as \ndeath or disability) prevent the CEO from continuing to serve. The Board reviews this emergency \nsuccession contingency plan annually or more frequently as deem ed appropriate.  \n The Board may review development and succession plans more frequently as it deems necessary or desirable.  \n \nBoard's Expectations of Executive Officers  \nExecutive officers are  responsible for the Company’s day-to-day business operations. Among other \nthings, the Board expects the following from these Company leaders : (a) to provide strong, informed , \nand ethical leadership; (b) to develop strategies  and operating plans  that build businesses with strong, \nsustainable marketplace positions that build share holder value over the long term; (c) to maintain \neffective operational control s designed to ensure compliance with the highest ethical standards, as well \nas with legal, regulatory , and other requirements , and to report regularly to the Board on such controls \nand compliance ; (d) to measure and report performance against peer enterprises; ( e) to provide sound \nsuccession planning and management development ; (f) to maintain a sound organizational structure; ( g) \nto inform the Board regularly of the status of key initiatives and changes in the Company’s  performance \n \nPage 9 of 9 \n    \n or the environment in which it operates; and ( h)  to address and resolve  on a timely basis  issues or \nconcerns raised by the Board or its committee s. Management , acting through the CEO , will inform the \nBoard of material developments as soon as practical and will not wait until regularly scheduled Board \nmeetings.  \n \nCommunications  \nManagement speaks for the Company . Inquiries from investors, analysts, the press, customers, \nsuppliers, or others should be referred to the CEO or other appropriate members of management . \nIndividual Directors may, from time to time, meet with various constituencies of the Company, at the request of or with the concurrence of M anagement . Directors are free to meet with or address the \npublic or special groups concerning board practices generally and other matters of interest to the Directors not directly related to activities of the Company, and such contacts will not require \nmanagement concurrence.  \n \nShareholder communications to the board  \nShareholders may contact an individual Director, the Board as a group, or a specified Board committee \nor group, including the I ndependent Directors as a group, by writing in care of the following:  \n Corporate Secretary  \n ALLETE, Inc.  \n 30 W.

D/B/A Minnesota Power; Canada Pension Plan Investment \nBoard; Global Infrastructure Management, LLC  (collectively, the “Petitioners”)  \nRequest Due: October 18, 2024 \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for the \nAcquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment \nBoard and Global Infrastructure Partners      Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 \nRequest:  \nYou state (Petition at 4):  “As of March 31, 2024, approximately 51 percent of ALLETE’s outstanding \nshares are owned by 18 investors, with BlackRock Fund Advisors (a subsidiary of BlackRock Inc. (“BlackRock”)) owning approximately 11.6 percent of common stock, with another approximately 2 percent owned by other BlackRock subsidiaries, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holding approximately 11.5 percent.”  (a) Who are the remaining 16 investors who make up the 51% —and their ownership \nshares?  (b) Describe the remaining 49% .  (c) What was your reason for making this distinction between \nthe 51% and the 49%?  \nResponse:  \nIt is Minnesota Power's typical practice to avoid stating formal legal objections and/or standing on those \nobjections to discovery in Minnesota regulatory proceedings, to the extent practicable, to facilitate a \ncooperative and productive process. However, many of the questions and stated premises, as well as the \nargumentative tone, in this set of information requests from CUB’s external witness (C UB IRs 1 -72) are \noutside typical discovery practices in the Minnesota regulatory process, and therefore necessarily affect the Company's and Partners' responses.  \nI\nn addition, consistent with Minnesota practice, the party(ies) and witness(es) responding to this discovery \nrequest are denoted by the witness information in the footer of this response.  \nExhibit DOC-309\n   \n \nWitness: Josh Taran  \nResponse Date: 10/18/2024  \nResponse by: Josh Taran  \nEmail Address: jtaran@allete.com  \nPhone Number: 218 -355-3332 \n    Witness: n/a    \nResponse Date: n/a   \nResponse by: n/a    \nEmail Address: n/a \nPhone Number: n/a    Witness: n/a    \nResponse Date: n/a   \nResponse by: n/a    \nEmail Address : n/a \nPhone Number: n/a    \n   \n a.
