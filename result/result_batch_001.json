Learn why this is important \n \nDear Chair Sieben and Commissioners,\nI am writing as a concerned resident to express my strong opposition to the proposed\nacquisition of the parent company of a Duluth-based electric utility by Global InfrastructurePartners, a division of BlackRock. This utility currently provides electricity to over 150,000Minnesotans, and the decision regarding its future should prioritize the public good overprivate profit.\nAllowing a Wall Street private equity firm to take over a vital public utility raises serious red\nflags. Private equity firms like BlackRock are notorious for putting profits for executives andshareholders ahead of the needs of communities. Handing control of a critical energy providerto a firm with no direct accountability to Minnesota residents risks increased rates, reducedtransparency, and service decisions that prioritize investor returns over reliable and affordableaccess to power.\nAs Jenna Yeakle of the Sierra Club rightly stated, “If the deal goes through, it will force\nratepayers to be beholden to the private equity agenda.” This is unacceptable. Our utilitiesshould be accountable to the public, not to corporate investors with no stake in ourcommunities.\nI urge the Public Utilities Commission to reject this proposal and ensure that Minnesota’s\nenergy future is controlled by those who have the public interest, environmental responsibility,and long-term affordability at heart—not by distant private equity firms.\nThank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter.Sincerely,Kristy M."

This is disgraceful that we are allowing Wall Street to buy\nover 30,000 acres of land in Northern Minnesota. And what will they do with all this land?The land not attached to the largest hydroelectric faucility in Minnesota? They'll do whatPE usually does, sell all the land to their real estate subsidiary, and then charge MNPower astronomical rates for it. How does this help Minnesotans?\n \nWe need clarity and transparency from the MNPUC as to why they believe that allowingBlackRock to acquire MN Power is good for ratepayers. We need clarity andtransparency as to how MNPUC will hold BlackRock accountable for all the promisesthat have been made in order to get this deal done.\nWe have sat here and listened to each commission member explain how in just oneweek, all their skepticism and fears had been erased and that they now had faith in trustin BlackRock to put the interests of Northern Minnesotans above the interests of WallStreet and their investors.\nHow will MNPUC hold BlackRock accountable for meeting Minnesotas 2040 carbon freegoals?\nPeople up here are very upset at this decision and now you need to explain how thisbenefits us in the north.\nJust today BlackRock is making another bid for another utility company. Does thecommission think that this new trend of Wall Street owning our utilities will result in a\npositive outcome?\n You need to issue a statement explaining in detail how this decision was made and whyincluding how it benefits us and the commitments that BlackRock has agreed to. Duluth is incredibly disappointed in this decision, and you all know that. Non profits,citizens, judges, and the AG warned against this… So how was this a unanimousdecision? \nVery Respectfully,\nDaniel Cocchiarella \n \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

This deal is not in the best interest of Minnesotaratepayers, communities, or the long-term public good.There are several reasons this sale should be rejected:1. Private Equity Ownership Puts Profit Over PeopleBlackRock and its affiliates are global investment firms whose primary responsibility is to deliverreturns to investors — not to protect local communities or keep electricity affordable. History hasshown that when private equity takes over utilities, it often leads to cost-cutting, reducedtransparency, and long-term rate increases to satisfy shareholder returns. Minnesota Power mustremain accountable to the public, not global financial markets.2. Threats to RatepayersWhile the buyers have made temporary promises around rate freezes and investment commitments,those promises are not enforceable in the long run — and there's no guarantee they won't bereversed or weakened later. Given the premium BlackRock and CPP are paying, it's reasonable toexpect they’ll seek to recover costs through higher rates. Minnesotans should not have to foot thebill for a Wall Street acquisition.3. Loss of Local Control and AccountabilityOnce Minnesota Power is under the control of BlackRock and CPP, decisions about our energy futuremay be made in distant boardrooms, not in the communities that rely on the service. This isespecially troubling given our unique climate, geography, and clean energy goals. We need a utilitypartner rooted in Minnesota, not one beholden to private investors scattered around the globe.4. Unclear Long-Term BenefitsSupporters of the deal claim it will help Minnesota Power finance its clean energy transition. ButAllete already has access to capital markets and regulatory support for clean investments. A sale isnot the only or best way to meet those goals. In fact, an administrative law judge reviewing the dealfound it posed a net harm to the public interest, and that should carry serious weight.5. Dangerous PrecedentApproving this sale sets a dangerous precedent: that Minnesota’s public utilities are up for sale tothe highest bidder. We should be working to strengthen public oversight of essential services, notselling them off to massive investment firms whose goals are not aligned with Minnesota values.In conclusion, this sale is not necessary, not beneficial, and not in the public interest. I urge you —whether as a regulator, elected official, or concerned citizen — to reject this deal and protectMinnesota’s energy future from the influence of private equity.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Bergman : \nMinnesota Power (or the “Company”) submits this filing to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”) in compliance with Decision Option 7.A. of the Staff’s \nComprehensive Decision Option List for the Commission’s October 3, 2025 hearing I n \nthe Matter of the  Petion for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment \nBoard (“CPP Investments”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”) .\n1 At the hearing, \nthe Commission voted unanimously to approve the motion authorizing the acquisition  by \nCPP Investments and GIP . \nIncluded in the approved motion is  Staff Alternative 5 that states: \nApprove Minnesota Power’s Petition subject to the terms of the July 11, 2025 Settlement Stipulation, as amended by the September 24, 2025 Addendum to Settlement Stipulation and the September 30, 2025 Second Addendum to Settlement Stipulation, except for the recommendations on Decision Options 13– 20 regarding findings of fact.  \nOn July 11, 2025, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power, CPP Investments and GIP  entered into a Settlement Stipulation \n(“Settlement ”) with a greed upon additional commitments  by ALLETE, Minnesota Power , \nCPP Investments and GIP that are consistent with the public interest  and which provide \nsubstantial benefits to the State of Minnesota and Minnesota Power’s customers . Item \n1.14 of the Settlement states:  \n1 The final order has not yet been issued in Docket No. E015/PA -24-198. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nMs. Bergman  \nOctober 10, 2025  \nPage 2 \n \n \n As a negotiated resolution, and without agreeing to any party’s underlying \nposition on this issue, Minnesota Power’s currently approved Return on Equity (“ROE”) will be changed from 9.78 percent to 9.65 percent. The change in ROE will take effect the first  full month after both of the following \nhave occurred: (i) the close of the Acquisition and (ii) when the order of the Commission becomes final. The 9.65 percent ROE will remain in effect until Minnesota Power files its next rate case and will be used to s et interim rates \nin Minnesota Power’s next Minnesota rate case. Nothing in this settlement stipulation shall be considered a commitment (i) to any specific ROE in the company’s next rate case or (ii) to use a specific methodology to determine the ROE in the company’s next rate case.  \nThe Comprehensive Decision Option List specifies that adoption of Staff Alternative 5 would result in adoption of all conditions agreed to in the amended Settlement, including \nDecision Option 7 which is the subject  of this compliance filing. Decision Option  7 states:  \nRequire Minnesota Power to apply the modified return on equity agreed to in paragraph 1.14 of the Settlement Stipulation to reduce rates beginning with the first full month after close of the Acquisition and the Commission Order is final.  \nA. Require Minnesota Power, within 10 days of the order, to file an amended tariff with updated rate calculations and a customer notice bill insert for Commission approval.  \nB. Delegate authority to the Executive Secretary to approve the \nupdated tariff and customer notice.  \nFor compliance with Decision Option 7.A., Minnesota Power is including the redline \nversions of the updated title page and tariffs  revised due to the  adjustment to the ROE. \nClean versions updating the footer information will be submitted once an order has been \nissued and Commission approval of this compliance filing is received. Additionally, the \nrevised Financial Schedules 1 through 18 supporting the ROE adjustment are included.  \nSchedules 19\n2 and 20  have been included solely  for consistency with what was provided \nin our December 20, 2024 Compliance Filing in the 2023 Rate Case Docket .3  \nMinnesota Power’s proposed customer notice bill insert is included. The Company has \nconsulted with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s Consumer Affairs Office on \nthe content of the customer notice and appreciates  their prompt review  and input .  \nApproximately 14 days are required for printing and insertion of the Customer Notices  \n \n2 Data included in the section labeled ‘ Schedule E -1’ on Schedule 19, Page 2 of the December 20, 2024 \nCompliance Filing  was inadvertently designated as Trade Secret. The Trade Secret designation has been \nremoved.   \n3 See Docket No. E015/GR -23-155. \nMs. Bergman  \nOctober 10, 2025  \nPage 3 \n \n \n once Commission approval is received.  Minnesota Power proposes to implement new \nrates beginning on the first day of the month after close of  the Acquisition and the \nCommission Order is final.

I am writing to express my concern regarding the acquisition of\nMinnesota Power by BlackRock. I believe it is imperative that we prevent one of our most critical utilities frombeing sold to a private equity firm, particularly one with such a controversial reputation.\nI am confident that you are aware of BlackRock’s true intentions, and I urge you to vote against this sale. The\npotential consequences are dire, as they could lead to the privatization of our electricity and eventually our waterresources. Furthermore, there is a growing concern that BlackRock may seek to establish data centers in our state,which could have significant implications for our privacy and security.\nThank you for your consideration,\nLogan Berquist"

This is\ndisgraceful and degrades the trust that the public places into public institutions. Private equity's\nprofit incentive structures care not about the needs of the people. It cares about turning profit, and\nthey clearly see energy as a long-term profit generator. At a time when our public utilities are beingseen as inputs to generate profit by countless AI data centers springing up across the country,\nprivate equity ogles at the opportunity to pull profits. The people that end up bearing these costs\nneed to have their interests cared for.  \nPrivatized profits, socialized costs.\n Your team of commissioners, appointed by Tim Walz, seem to be putting the interests of private\nequity above the interests of the community, contradicting your mission statement. I'd like to\nbelieve that this isn't the case, that you're working with interests of Minnesotans, but this decision isappalling. Is there going to be any communication as to why this deal has been approved? How we\nwill benefit from this? Are there long-term assurances of utility price control? Seems to me that\nBlackRock is forecasting that this sector will be a profit generator, money being extracted from theworking class and, in this case, the 150,000 residents directly serviced by Allete and its subsidiaries.\n \nYour commissioners office plays a critical role in our democracy. In a time when the faith that thepeople have in the government is at an all time low, this action further degrades any bit of trust that\nstill exists.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

This decision is a betrayal ofMinnesotans and a clear signal that the voices of communities and ratepayers were ignored infavor of money and corporate interests.\nMinnesota Power is not just another asset to be traded, and collectively, you failed to\nrecognize this. It is a critical public utility that directly impacts the daily lives of families,workers, and businesses across our state. By handing control to a global investment firm withno ties to Minnesota, the Commission has effectively sold out our communities, opening the\ndoor to higher rates, reduced accountability, and decisions made by corporate executives whohave no stake in our future.\nThis is irresponsible regulation.  It is a failure to protect the people you are entrusted to serve.\nMinnesotans deserve affordable, reliable energy and leadership committed to our state’sneeds — not rubber-stamped deals that enrich shareholders at our expense. I sincerely hopeit did not enrich Commission members as well. \nIf this sale is allowed to stand, I demand that the Commission take aggressive and transparent\naction to hold BlackRock accountable. Ratepayers should not have to pay the price for the\nCommission’s decision to prioritize profit over the public good.\nRenee Saamanen \nRatepayer and MN Power Customer \n \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nDear Commissioners,\nI am writing as a concerned Minnesota resident to express my strong opposition to the\nproposed acquisition of Minnesota Power by BlackRock/Global Infrastructure Partners. I urgethe Commission to reject this acquisition in alignment with the public interest. Mega profit-driven Wall Street pleasing Corporations, who always choose profits over people, are notaligned with our core values and norms as Minnesotans. We are a jewel in this country, for myentire life as a Minnesotan we have opposed the takeover of our public's vital resources byfaceless mega corporations that serve their shareholders not the public. And not a soul canconvince a single Minnesotan that Blackrock will maintain our fierce environmental standards.My energy rates are already going up with Xcel as my provider, under Blackrock, they willsoar and continue to soar. All the while, they will be destroying our precious environment. Westand out as a state that protects the public interest over profits, and we do very wellfinancially as well compared to most states. We set a standard on the American stage for howthings can be, and that Minnesotans and our environment and our community norms andvalues remain upheld. Our elected Officials are often brought in for interviews on NationalTelevision simply to illustrate to other states and their populaces that there is always another\nway, a better way . Minnesota has proven this time and time again, we all do better when we\nall do better. When we follow that, Minnesotans come out on top and our State remains theGreatest in the country when it comes to setting a standard. The other thing that sets us apart isthat our leadership keeps the promises they make to their citizens, they don't sell us out forcorporate greed. Today's vote is a vote on Corporate Greed that will change the face of myhome and birthplace for generations to come. Please, use some decency and Minnesota values,and for God's sake (our family has been praying), stop this acquisition. Put Minnesota beforeWall Street. From our cost of living and power bills to the immense disregard Blackrock hasfor the environment (and their partners and \"friends\" at Wall Street). Blackrock is as anti-Minnesotan as a corporation could get. My heart sinks at the fact that I feel compelled to writethis in the final hours as I learn of this tragedy unfolding in my lifelong home. Please voteNO!\nAdministrative Law Judge Recommendation.\nAdministrative Law Judge Megan J. McKenzie, in her July 15, 2025 report from the\nMinnesota Office of Administrative Hearings, recommended rejecting this acquisition. Shecited significant concerns that the deal would not serve the public interest and could threatenMinnesota Power’s ability to meet the state’s carbon-free energy goals ( Utility Dive, 2025\n).\nAttorney General Keith Ellison’s Position.\nAttorney General Ellison has also raised concerns regarding potential negative impacts on\nconsumers and state energy policies, formally submitting comments and requesting reviewthrough contested-case proceedings ( Renewable Energy World, 2025\n).\nEnvironmental and Advocacy Groups.A broad coalition, including the Center for Earth, Energy & Democracy, Citizens UtilityBoard of Minnesota, Sierra Club, and Clean Water Action Minnesota, have voiced opposition.Their central concerns include prioritization of private equity profits over the public good,potential increases in electricity rates, reduced local oversight, and threats to Minnesota’sclean energy transition ( CEED, 2025\n; CUB, 2025 ; The Guardian, 2025 ).\nPublic Interest Concerns.The acquisition risks transferring control of a vital public utility to private equity interests,which could undermine affordability, local accountability, and Minnesota’s climatecommitments.\nFor these reasons, I strongly urge the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to reject this\nacquisition and uphold the recommendation of Judge McKenzie. The decision on October 3,2025, will significantly impact Minnesotans and our collective energy future and the future ofour cost of living. The ripple effects of a profit-over-people mega corporation like Blackrockcoming into our home creates a standard and precedent that others, and even worse, will feelwelcome coming here to destroy our lives and our lands. Say no! We, the public, rely on youto represent us as Minnesotans, in our values and norms. This acquisition would shatter thosenorms. Blackrock is using Minnesotans and the Midwest as a testing ground to step into the\"material\" realm of business, not just influencing people via the media and other subsets butnow wanting to have direct control of public utilities. Anyone blind to the dangers of thisshould not be at the PUC. Vote NO and strongly! God Bless Us All... and may light, truth,nobility and wisdom guide you today. Do the right thing.\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter.Sincerely,\nElizabeth CrandallSaint Paul, Minnesota\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nDear Public Utilities Commission:\nIf there ever was a company that was too big to regulate, BlackRock would be it.  BlackRock’s\nfinancial and political power dwarfs Enbridge, which left Minnesota holding the bag with the\ndamaged aquifer after the warnings of experts that approval of the pipeline would put us atserious risk. Its $11.5 trillion in assets “exceed the GDP of every nation except the UnitedStates and China,” according to the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, known as CUB.\nAllete's sale of Minnesota Power to BlackRock would benefit Allete shareholders but not\nMinnesota. Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie’s conclusion could not be clearer.The sale “would result in net harm to the public interest.”  In spite of Allete and BlackRock’sclaims that Minnesota Power customers would not suffer excessive rate hikes, McKenzieconcluded that the buyers “are planning on significant rate increases.”  The sale “creates an\nunacceptable risk of rate increase and rate shock in a critical and economically vulnerable areaof Minnesota.”\nAllete claims the sale will benefit Minnesota because the new partners “were intentionally and\nstrategically chosen” to achieve Minnesota’s carbon-free goals. However, “the evidence showsthe Partners were ultimately the only bidders for the company and were chosen based on theirwillingness to pay a stock premium” McKenzie wrote. \nPrivate equity firms have a record of facilitating greenwashing.  \nPlease reject the takeover of Minnesota Power by BlackRock.Steven Smith1011 37th St. E.\nMinneapolis MN 55407612-249-26722124smith@gmail.com\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

View it as a Web page .\nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission\nNEWS RELEASE\nFor Immediate Release:\nOctober 3, 2025Minnesota Public Utilities Commission\nContact: Cori Rude-Young , 651-201-2241\nMinnesota PUC approves ALLETE acquisition with\nunprecedented conditions protecting Minnesota Powerratepayers\nSt. Paul, Minn. – The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) approved the acquisition\nof ALLETE, Inc., the company that operates Minnesota Power. As part of the acquisition, the\nCommission ordered a comprehensive set of conditions that will provide substantial benefits\nfor customers – including more than $200 million in quantifiable savings, protections andbenefits.\nThrough this agreement, Minnesota Power customers remain protected under the full\noversight and authority of the Minnesota PUC.\nThe acquiring entities, Global Infrastructure Partners and Canada Pension Plan Investment\nBoard (the Partners), along with ALLETE, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, and a\nbroad coalition of organizations including labor, clean energy groups, and consumer\nadvocates have agreed to the conditions imposed by the Commission.\n“This decision underscores the Commission’s commitment to ensuring reliable utility service\nat reasonable rates and protecting the public interest,” said Commission Chair Katie Sieben.“Importantly, ratepayers will not pay for this acquisition. We required stronger terms to make\nsure Minnesota Power customers continue to benefit from some of the lowest bills in the\nnation. We know how important affordable electricity is – not only for families, but also for theindustries that drive Northern Minnesota’s economy – and we only approved this sale afteradding strong provisions to safeguard those priorities.”\nThe conditions that the Commission ordered will provide immediate financial relief for\ncustomers, ensure long-term stability to the utility and its customers, and direct critical\ninvestments in the state’s energy transition.\nFinancial relief and cost protections\n$50 million in bill credits: The Partners must pay $50 million in bill credits to Minnesota\nPower customers. Minnesota Power will distribute these credits by 2032 based on a\nfuture PUC-approved schedule.\n$20 monthly discount and $3.5 million in arrearage forgiveness: Eligible low-income\nresidential customers will receive a $20 monthly bill discount, and arrearages will be\nreduced to pre-COVID-19 balances or lower.\nCaps on utility profitability: The Commission imposed caps on financial metrics to limit\nthe utility’s profitability and help reduce potential rate increases. Minnesota Power’s\nReturn on Equity is capped at 9.78% until December 31, 2030, and Minnesota Power’s\nequity ratio in its capital structure will be capped at 53.0% until December 31, 2030.\n“Freezing the Return on Equity is a vital tool to ensure customer stability,” said CommissionerHwikwon Ham. “By capping this, we are preventing the acquisition from being used as ajustification for excessive profit-seeking at the expense of Minnesota Power ratepayers,\nguaranteeing that the utility focuses on necessary, prudent investments rather than\nmaximizing returns from the change in ownership.”\nClean energy and customer investmentsMinnesota Power is required to meet the state’s Carbon-Free Standard Law. The\nCommission is ensuring savings by requiring future planning to be done in a cost-effectivemanner.\n$10 Million for a long-term residential energy bill mitigation fund: The Partners will funda $10 million program to support weatherization and electrification for Minnesota\nPower’s low- and moderate-income customers. Funding for this program will come\nfrom the Partners, not Minnesota Power customers.\nClean-Firm Energy Plan: Minnesota Power will file a new “Clean Firm Plan” in itsresource planning docket, that considers changes from the acquisition. The new plan\nwill use $50 million in new funding from the Partners and will be developed in\nconsultation with stakeholders representing consumer groups, labor and\nenvironmental organizations.\n“The $10 million dedicated to home energy efficiency upgrades is critical because it will buildupon temporary bill relief and provide a permanent solution to energy affordability for\nhundreds of families,” said Commissioner Audrey Partridge. “Home energy efficiency\nupgrades lower household bills month after month, and improve the health and safety ofhomes, which is especially important for our most vulnerable citizens who are\ndisproportionately impacted by high heating costs.”\nLong-term oversight and worker protections\nThe decision also ensures robust long-term regulatory oversight and mandates specific\nprotections for Minnesota Power employees and operations.\nService quality and reliability: The PUC has a new way to hold Minnesota Power\naccountable for customer service and reliability. If the company fails to meet specific\nbenchmarks, such as service reliability, complaint levels, Cold Weather Rule\nprotections, or timely call response, it will face $250,000 under-performance paymentsper violation, with half of the funds going back to customers as bill credits and halfreinvested to fix the underlying issue.\nWorkforce and community stability: Extension of employee protections from two to fiveyears, a continued Duluth headquarters, requirements to maintain local staff levels,\nand Minnesota Power must continue to prioritize local, union labor and require\ncontractors to pay prevailing wages.\nOversight and accountability: Majority-independent Board governance with Minnesotarepresentation, expanded reporting and transparency, and compliance tools.\nThe comprehensive conditions imposed by the Commission demonstrate a deepcommitment to ensuring the Partners' responsibilities are strictly enforced, that ratepayers\nare protected, and that the acquisition results in meaningful benefits to customers, workers\nand the community served by Minnesota Power.\nFor further details and to view the full discussion, visit the PUC’s website: September 25\nmeeting, October 3  meeting.\nAboutThe Minnesota Public Utilities Commission regulates three cornerstone service industries in\nMinnesota's economy: electricity, natural gas and telephone. The Commission’s mission is tocreate and maintain a regulatory environment that ensures safe, adequate, and efficient\nutility services at fair, reasonable rates consistent with State telecommunications and energy\npolicies. It does so by providing independent, consistent, professional, and comprehensiveoversight and regulation of utility service providers.

Aside from theeconomical costs to residents, BlackRock in partnership with AI developers have unfair leverage toexploit the natural resources of Lake Superior and other fresh water resources, which are necessaryto operate data centers.

    "content": "1 \n \nOctober 1, 2025  \n \nTo Chair Sieben, Vice -Chair Sullivan, & Commissioners:  \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on Docket #24 -198, the proposed acquisition  of \nALLETE/ Minnesota Power.  \nClean Water Action has worked in Minnesota since 1982, focusing on finding solutions to \nhealth, consumer, environmental, and community problems; developing strong, community -\nbased environmental leadership; and working for policies which improve lives and protect water. \nOur focus includes supporting environment al justice  and equitable clean energy transitions to \ncombat climate change ; protecting and restoring the Great Lakes for Minnesota; and ensuring \nsafer chemicals for use in our homes and daily lives, as well as source and toxics reduction in \nplastics and other forms of waste. All our work culminates in the overarching goal of protecting \nthe water we drink for generations to come.  Clean Water Action  Minnesota  urges the Public \nUtilities Commission to deny  the proposed acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by private \nequity.  \n \nThe proposed acquisition  of ALLETE/ Minnesota Power by private equity holdings firms Canada \nPension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and  Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP),  a part of \nBlackRock,  threatens  the success of our net -zero emission goals and standards , along with  the \neconomic security and energy independence of Minnesotans. In fact, the business model of \nprivate e quity nearly ensures  the failure of both our emissions goals and standards , and \nMinnesotans’ financial health and independence. Clean Water Action urges you to deny  the \nproposed acquisition  \nPrivate equity (PE), as you know, is responsible first to its shareholders and returning a profit to \nthem. This is anathema to the fundamental responsibility of a public  utility, which is of course, to \nprovide a public  benefit. Per your authority and common practice, an administrative law judge \nwas asked to hold a contested case hearing , and you received their findings of fact, conclusions \nof law, and recommendations. Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie cou ld not have been \nmore clear : “...ALLETE , Inc. and the Partners have not met their burden of proof to show the \ntransaction is consistent with the public interest. As a result, the Commission should DENY the \npetition for approval of an acquis ition of ALLETE by the Partners.”1  \nAdditionally, the acquisition offer is alarming and all but necessitates an increase in energy rates \nto approximately 150,000 Minnesotans. An ALLETE proxy statement indicated the acquisition \n \n1 State of Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings for the Public Utilities Commission, OAH 25 -2500 -\n40339, page 3.

For private equity, paying a \npremium increases the pressure to generate high returns to recoup the investment. As such, it \nis likely the need for high returns will result in increased rates for the consumer s who have no \nother utility option. As detailed in ALJ McKenzie’s findings and recommendations, section D, \nsubd. 69, “[p]rivate equity firms often target gross investment returns of 15 to 20 pe rcent per \nyear,” which is exactly what GIP is targeting, in addition  to a 5 -7% annual cash yield . This math \ncan really only work a couple ways to achieve that: increase consumer rates and/or cut \nservices. We’ve seen this play out before , notably in Michigan after the 2014 sale of Upper \nPeninsula Power Company (UPPCO) to eventually renamed  Basalt Infrastructure Partners  \n(BIP) , a private equity  firm. Under the guise of, “provid[ing] UPPCO with the capital necessary to \nmaintain and improve its existing de livery infrastructure,”3 the company  applied for a rate \nincrease in 2015 ,4 leading to unaffordable bills for consumers .5 In 2018, the company again filed \nto increase rates by nearly $10 million , requiring the Michigan Attorney General to intervene to \nreduce that rate increase to $3.5 million, citing the financial burden placed upon Michiganders \nfrom “extremely high elect ric rates.”6 As private equity does, UPPCO was sold in 2021 to \nanother private infrastructure investor, Axium Infrastructure, which promised not to raise rates \nuntil 2023. Right on schedule, Axium sought and received a new rate settlement agreement with \na 10.1% rate increase,7 which took effect July 1, 2023. A year later, Axium filed for a second \nrate increase request of 16% ($16.9 million in revenue) , again  requiring the Michigan Attorney \nGeneral to intervene and argue to limit the rate increase to $7 million in revenue.8 As a result of \nthe rate hikes sought by its private equity owners, UPPCO rates were $9 per kilowatt -hour \n(KwH) higher than the average rate at other investor -owned utilities in Michigan.9 The situation \nwith UPPCO is not un ique nor uncommon, and is what we can, and should, expect with a \n \n2 Institute for Local Self -Reliance, “ Why BlackRock Wants to Buy Your Electrical Utility” , Institute for Local \nSelf Reliance, July 16 2025. https://ilsr.org/article/energy -democracy/blackrock -utility -purchase -\nler240/#:~:text=statement%20indicating%20a -,19%25%20to%2022%25%20premium, -.%20This%20high%2\n0price  \n3 “Integrys Energy Group Agrees to Sell Upper Peninsula Power Company to BBIP\", BusinessWire, January 20, \n2024 https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140120005706/en/Integrys -Energy -Group -Agreesto -\nSell -Upper -Peninsula -Power -Company -to-BBIP.  \n4 \"Rate Debate\", Pioneer Tribune, June 23, 2016, https://www.pioneertribune.com/articles/ratedebate/.  \n5 Matheny, Keith, \"Power bills are whoppers for some in Michigan's U.P.\" Detroit Free Press, September 7, \n2016, https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/09/07/poweroutrage -electric -bills -upper -\npeninsula/89593302/.  \n6 \"AG Nessel Steps in to Protect UP Customers from Exorbitant Electric Rate Increases\" Michigan \nDepartment of Attorney General, February 26, 2019, https://www.michigan.gov/en/ag/News/press -\nreleases/2019/02/26/AG -Nessel -Steps -in-toProtect -UP-Customers -from -Exorbitant -Electric -Rate -\nIncreases.  \n7 MPSC Approves Settlement Agreement\", Upper Peninsula Power Company, March 24, 2023, \nhttps://www.uppco.com/mpsc -approves -settlement -agreement/.  \n8 \"AG Nessel Fights for 60% Reduction of UPPCO's $16.9 Million Rate Increase Request\", Michigan \nDepartment of Attorney General, July 23, 2024, https://www.michigan.gov/ag/news/press -\nreleases/2024/07/23/ag -nessel -fights -for-reduction -ofuppcos -rate -increase -request.  \n9 \"Comparison of average rates (in cents per kWh for MPSC -regulated electric utilities in Michigan\", Michigan \nPublic Service Commission Utility Rate Books, December 1, 2024 https://www.michigan.gov/ - \n/media/Project/Websites/mpsc/consumer/electric/rates1.pdf? rev=0d9771b23fa84478a8061e8d2e 6f93ed.  \n \n 3  \n successful acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by this purchasing group : electric rates are \nvery likely to increase.  \nFurther, private equity is bad for employees and bad for business. For employees, a 2019 study \nby researchers at the University of Chicago and Harvard Business School found average job \nlosses of 4.4% in the two years after a company is bought by private equity, rela tive to control \ncompanies; employment shrinks 13% over two years after buyouts of publicly listed firms, on \naverage, and again relative to cont rol firms; and average earnings per worker fall 1.7% at target \nfirms after buyouts.10 Exacerbating these job losses and wage decreases, private equity -owned \ncompanies typically face higher bankruptcy risk due to higher levels of debt. The Private Equity \nStakeholder Project found that private equity firms played a role in 11 of the 17 largest US \ncorporate  bankruptcies during the first six months of 2024,11 and a 2019 study found that \ncompanies bought by private -equity firms are 10 times more likely to go bankrupt th an those \nwhich are not.12 In fact, GIP owned a 65% stake in SunPower,13 one of the largest residential \nsolar installation companies in the US , which filed for bankruptcy in August 2024.14 For a utility \nresponsible for providing long -term, sustainable energy production for its consumers, the \nvolatility of private equity and the associated plague of bankruptcies  is a poison pill to the future \nof equitable and affordable electricity.  \nFinally, this proposed acquisition is rife for opportunity for BlackRock to pay itself and incentivize \nresource -intensive activities in our state. BlackRock is among the largest investors in some of \nMinnesota Power’s larger power customers, competitors, and companies holding power \npurchase agreements with Minnesota Power .15 For example, BlackRock controls 9.72% and \n10.87%, respectiv ely, of Cleveland Cliffs and US Steel, which represent 56% of Minnesota \nPower’s retail sales from their taconite mining operations.16 If BlackRock were to own the \nenergy production, it would create a situation where they would paying themselves via power \npurchase agreements and could incentivize resource -intensive and environmentally -degrading \n \n10 Davis, Steven, et al., The Economic Effects of Private Equity Buyouts, July 8, 2021, \nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=3465723  \n11 ”Private equity behind 65% of billion dollar bankruptcies in 2024”, Private Equity Stakeholder Project, \nSeptember 10, 2024. https://pestakeholder.org/news/private -equity -behind -65-of-billion -dollar -\nbankruptcies -in-2024/  \n12 Ayash, Brian and Rastad, Mahdi, Leveraged Buyouts and Financial Distress (July 20, 2019).

Further, we know utilities want high -consumption customers since \nthat will lead to more revenue. With private equity at the helm of energy production, they will  \nlikely  fight tooth and nail for bringing more energy -intensive data c enters to Minnesota, which \nwe know will suck up our finite clean water resources,17 along with spiking residential electricity \nrates18 and threatening the reliability of our electrical grid.19 This incentivization, regardless of \nintentionality, is in direct conflict with the overall emissions goals and standards set forth by the \nState  and does not prioritize public benefit over private profit.  \nThe business model, existing vertical integration and monopolistic behavior, volatility, \nmisaligned priorities , and a cautionary warning from an administrative law judge  prove private \nequity has no place  in owning a public utility in Minnesota. Private equity has yet to show that \ntheir involvement does, in fact, lead to a better service for the consumer, but they have shown \n(GIP, in particular) that they know how to drive a business to bankruptcy. Higher rates for \ncustomers and ownership changing hands every few years does not bode well for consumer \nconfidence in a utility, nor does it encourage a transparent process for rate increase requests. It \nis incumbent on this appo inted commission to deliver the promise of any public utility \ncommissions: fair and equitable electricity rates and sustainable energy production. Selling a \npublic utility to private equity accomplishes neither of those fundamental functions.

I'm writing to urge you to oppose theacquisition of Allete/MN Power by BlackRock and private equity in general (Docket 24-198). \nI have deep concerns about public services becoming owned and operated by private\ncompanies who are interested in their profits and bottom line. While this is understandable inbusiness, it has no place in utilities — public services that we all NEED to survive. We do nothave the option to choose our power companies, because they're operated by region. If thissale goes through, we will not have nearly the influence or oversight compared to what existswith a publicly owned utility. \nI have deep concerns about how rates could go up, the ways promises made now could be\nbroken (e.g., like shifting to renewable energy), and the possibility that routine maintenance isnot completed under the guise of saving money to increase profits. Of course, no one can knowthe future, and may be they would be an upstanding, honorable owner. But, they also mightnow be. And once sold, that's a decision we can't undo, at least not easily.\nPlease do not allow the private ownership of a public service. Places like Texas have shown us\nthis isn't likely to go well. We also see this when public lands become privately owned and thepublic interest is no longer honored.

What will stop Blackrock from significantly increasing the price ofelectricity? Wny would we willingly give away public control of a public good/service to aprivate company?

Learn why this is important\nDear Public Utilities Commission: \nPlease deny the proposed acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by private equity.The proposed acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power by private equity holdings firms\nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP|B) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), apart of BlackRock, threatens the environment and the economic security and energyindependence of Minnesotans. The business model of private equity nearly ensures the failureof both our emissions goals and standards, and Minnesotans' financial health andindependence. \nPlease do not approve this at the expense of Minnesota and Minnesotans—we and our kids\ncan’t afford that. \nThank you for your time.

Learn why this is important\nDear Commissioners,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed acquisition of Minnesota Power\nby BlackRock.\nMinnesota Power is a critical utility that provides essential electricity to residents and\nbusinesses across northern Minnesota. As a regulated monopoly, its first obligation mustalways be to ratepayers and the long-term well-being of our communities. Allowing a largeWall Street investment firm to take control raises significant concerns about accountability,transparency, and the prioritization of shareholder profits over customer interests.\nMy concerns include:\nLocal accountability: Decision-making could be driven by distant financial interests\nrather than the needs of Minnesotans.\nRates and affordability: Profit-driven management may put upward pressure oncustomer bills, undermining affordability.\nReliability and investment: Critical infrastructure investments must prioritize resilienceand sustainability, not just short-term financial returns.\nClean energy transition: Minnesota has set ambitious climate and energy goals, and it isvital that our utilities pursue them with urgency and commitment. There is no guaranteethat BlackRock would align with these objectives.\nUtilities are not just businesses—they are lifelines for our communities. I urge theCommission to reject this proposed acquisition and ensure that Minnesota Power remainsaccountable to the people it serves.\nThank you for your consideration of my comments and for your work in protecting the public\ninterest.\nSincerely,\nBrad Wildenborg Rochester MN\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

(MP, Partners, Department , \nResolving Parties )  \n        \nPage 5 of 23 \n OR \nStaff Revised 15.  Adopt the modifications to ALJ Report Section III.C (findings 139 –178) and \nnew Section III.CC (findings 284 –325), regarding Petitioners’ proposed commitments, as shown \nin Attachment  B to the Petitioners’ August 4, 2025 Exceptions , to the extent consistent with the \nCommission’s decisions . Do not adopt Petitioners’ proposed findings 148A and 298 to the \nextent that they imply a predetermination that the forthcoming  proposal to make  the regulated \nutility a separate legal entity will be  in the public interest.  Do not adopt Petitioners’ proposed \nfindings 152 and 152C related to interpretation of the affiliated interest statute . Reject  ALJ \nfindings 152, 274 , and 275 regarding  affiliated interest reporting . \n16. Adopt the following findings as proposed in the Department’s August 4, 2025 exceptions \nrelating to the Settlement Stipulation: [Only if Decision Option 4 or 5 is selected]  \nA. 180a, regarding the Settlement Stipulation generally. (Department , Resolving \nParties ) \nB. 221a, regarding credit -rating restrictions on dividend or distribution payments by \nALLETE, limitations on direct credit support, non -consolidation opinion. \n(Department , Resolving Parties ) \nC. 187a, regarding the five -year capital commitment and non -recoverable clean firm \ntechnology investment fund. (Department , Resolving Parties ) \nD. 222a, regarding ROE reduction, waiver of right to file rate case before Nov. 1, 2026, \nland -sale revenue refund. (Department , Resolving Parties ) \nE. 228a, regarding service -quality standards, reporting, and underperformance \npayments. (Department , Resolving Parties ) \nF. 266a, regarding post -acquisition governance concerns and bankruptcy -related \nprotections. (Department , Resolving Parties ) \n17. Modify ALJ finding 155, regarding affordability program commitments, to clarify:  \nA. That the CARE program commitment in the Settlement Stipulation will benefit the \npublic interest compared to the status quo because the rate -recoverability of \naffordability programs alone does not guarantee that utilities will support raising \nsurcharges to fund their expansion and because this commitment affords an \nopportunity to, potentially, establish a higher baseline level of investment in the \nCARE program in Docket No. E -015/M -11-409. (Staff interpretation of ECC , Resolving \nParties ) \nB. There is public benefit in having an infusion of funds into affordability programming \nthat comes from shareholders and not from other ratepayers. (ECC , Resolving \nParties ) \n        \nPage 6 of 23 \n C. The total amount that petitioners estimate they will pay toward arrearage \nforgiveness does not adequately capture the magnitude of the value arrearage \nforgiveness would have for each customer receiving it, from the customer’s \nperspective. (Staff interpreta tion of ECC , Resolving Parties ) \n18. Reject the statement in ALJ Report Addendum A, ¶  4, that “It is unclear whether \n[commenters in support of the Acquisition] felt obligated to support Minnesota Power due \nto the financial support they are provided by the Company.” (MP, Partners , Resolving \nParties ) \n19. Adopt the following ALJ Report modifications as proposed in LIUNA’s August 4, 2025 \nexceptions: (Staff interpretations of LIUNA)  \nA. Reject findings 73 and 74 regarding the Partners’ oil and gas holdings. (LIUNA , \nResolving Parties ) \nB. Reject finding 87 regarding Minnesota Power’s motivations for selecting the \nPartners. (LIUNA , Resolving Parties ) \nC. Reject finding 117 regarding Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman \nChristie’s statements on the purchase of GIP by BlackRock. (LIUNA , Resolving \nParties ) \nD. Modify finding 124 to add that the record does not show that the alternatives \nproposed by intervenors could adequately meet ALLETE’s anticipated capital needs. \nAlso find there is evidence that such measures would expose ratepayers and \nstakeholders to unacc eptable risks while jeopardizing the utility’s ability to meet \nlegal requirements including the Carbon Free Standard. (LIUNA , Resolving Parties ) \nE. Modify finding 125 to state that the record does not establish the availability of cost -\ncompetitive, local power purchase agreements sufficient to adequately substitute \nfor available capital to meet Minnesota Power’s requirements in alignment with the \nvalues of the utility, stakeholders, and state policy goals. (Staff interpretation of \nLIUNA , Resolving Parties ) \nF. Modify finding 126 to add that demand response, energy -efficiency measures, and \ngrid-enhancing technologies have already been incorporated into resource plans and \nthat the record does not show there are opportunities for incremental advances \nsufficient to mitigate the utility’s capital needs. (LIUNA , Resolving Parties ) \nG. Reject finding 129 regarding incentives to grow rate base. (LIUNA , Resolving Parties ) \nH. Modify findings 133 and 135 to find that access to capital at the scale ALLETE has \nforecasted it will need to meet the Carbon Free Standard would be high risk; \ntherefore, it is unlikely the Company would be able to meet its capital needs through \npublic mar kets without the Acquisition. (LIUNA , Resolving Parties ) \n        \nPage 7 of 23 \n I. Reject finding 186 regarding ALLETE’s 2025 –2039 resource plan. (LIUNA , Resolving \nParties ) \nJ. Modify findings 272 –273 to state that the proposed governance structure balances \nthe interests of GIP investors against the interests of CPP investors, which will \nreduce the risk of either partner engaging in improper affiliate transactions that \ncould harm  ALLETE for the benefit of outside interests. (LIUNA , Resolving Parties ) \nK. Reject finding 276 and find that the 2019 University of Chicago and Harvard Business \nSchool study cited by witness Baker found that the impacts of private equity \nownership vary based on factors including characteristics of the operating company \nand economi c circumstances. (LIUNA, IBEW , Resolving Parties ) \n20.
