The practical events involving (subj cos) the hedges wouldlikely mortgage assets at full value placing the new cash asset into banking available to thehedgie. The next emerging actions are special dividends designated beneficial to factions.They could legally usurp the newfound cash via consultants they own, well cash simplybecomes depleted by legal schemes.Now that hedgie has depleted the resources they grossly boast we need a RATE RAISE foroperations so the daily rate payer is ask for support.

    "content": "1 \n To: consumer.puc@state.mn.us  (MPUC Docket # 24-198  \n(Proposed acquisition of Minnesota Power / Allete by BlackRock) \nJT Haines, Duluth, MN \nApril 17, 2025 \n \nDear Commissioners, \nMy name is JT Haines, I am a Minnesota Power ratepayer and resident of northern \nMinnesota. I am also a lawyer with experience in private equity and mergers & acquisitions, \nhaving worked as an associate for ﬁve years in the corporate department of a major \nMinneapolis law ﬁrm.1 Thank you for considering my comment about the proposed \nacquisition by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and Blackrock/Global \nInfrastructure Partners (GIP) (together, “Blackrock”) of Allete / Minnesota Power (MP). I urge \nyou to ﬁnd this proposed acquisition of MP by Blackrock not in the public interest. \nThe three main points I want to make in this comment are in regard to MP’s claims in this \ndocket about needing more infrastructure and more capital to build that infrastructure. \nMP’s recent IRP asserts the need for 1100MW of new capacity,2 including 1000MW of new \ngas. (1) What is missing from MP’s simpliﬁed rationale is that MP itself actively promotes  \nthis additional demand . MP has a ﬁnancial interest in creating the very demand that it is \nclaiming as a justiﬁcation for this proposed acquisition. Testimony about the need for more \ncapital and infrastructure from MP should be discounted. (2) Blackrock owns stakes in \ncurrent and potential MP customers, creating a clear incentive for self-dealing that is in \nviolation of the public interest and reason alone to reject this proposed acquisition. (3) \nAnnual global climate emissions continue to increase, making MPs claims about the need \nfor this transaction to support new gas infrastructure further against the public interest. \n(1) MP promotes the demand it claims as justiﬁcation for the proposed acquisition. \nAs an investor-owned utility, Minnesota Power has a direct proﬁt interest in increasing load \nand infrastructure build. This is because the proﬁt allowed for the regulated entity is \ndirectly related to the value of assets. “The higher the assets, the higher the total \nproﬁt…There is a clear incentive to build the most expensive infrastructure possible, \n \n1 I practiced as an attorney in the corporate department of the Minneapolis law ﬁrm of Dorsey & Whitney LLP \nfrom 2005-2010. Representative ﬁle involvement includes the sale of cheese assets by Land O’Lakes to \nSaputo, Inc., for $216 million. https://www.reuters.com/article/business/saputo-buys-land-olakes-cheese-\nunit-for-216-mln-idUSN21271056/   \n2 Minesota Power 2025-2039 Integrated Resource Plan, March 3, 2025 | MPUC Docket No. E015/RP-25-127 \n2 \n because it (almost) automatically translates into bigger proﬁts.”3 As one former employer \nquipped recently in a discussion of this docket, “anything to spin another turbine.” \nLocal observation of MP over the years bears this out. We have witnessed MP partner with \ncorporate interests to promote projects like Enbridge’s Line 3 and Glencore’s PolyMet \nvociferously. We have seen how MP executives support local politicians who support these \npotential new Large Industrial customers. We have seen MP use modeling in its IRP ﬁlings \nthat include these potential new customers (like Glencore/PolyMet) and use that modeling \nas justiﬁcation for new infrastructure (like the Nemadji Trail Energy Center). We have seen \nMP place its very own representatives in elected o Ưice (like the Duluth City Council4) and \non the Boards of Directors of potential new customers (like Glencore/PolyMet5).  \nAn event this month in Saint Paul illustrates this dynamic. MP, alongside current LI \ncustomers USS and Cli Ưs, as well as  potential new Large Industrial (LI) customers Twin \nMetals, NewRange Copper Nickel (the re-branded PolyMet), and Mining Minnesota \nsponsored an event in St. Paul that was hosted by six area state legislators.6 \n \n \n3 See Robinson, Buddy, Testimony to Public Utilities Commission regarding the proposed acquisition of \nAllete/Minnesota Power. Docket # 24-198. \n4 MP business development manager Arik Forsman sits on the Duluth City Council. \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/arikforsman/   \n5 Al Hodnick, President of Allete from 2009 to 2019 has served on the Board of PolyMet Mining since 2011. \nhttps://www.allete.com/Governance/Hodnik  https://polymetmining.com/about-polymet-mining-\ncorp/leadership/alan-r-hodnik/   \n6 https://www.linkedin.com/company/mining-minnesota/posts/?feedView=all   \n\n3 \n The Jobs for Minnesotans Board – also a sponsor -- includes representatives from \nMinnesota Power, the Building and Construction Trades, the Chamber of Commerce, and \nadditional elected o Ưicials.7 \n \n \n \nI have personally observed over ten years that, together, these associations exert \nsigniﬁcant political pressure on local politicians, which creates political pressure at the \nstate level, which creates pressure on our regulatory decision-making. It is clear that MP’s \ndirect ﬁnancial interest in promoting new consumption alongside current and potential \ncustomers is superordinate to – and therefore in conﬂict with -- the broader public interest. \nAs discussed in the next section, it should be taken as a given that ownership by Blackrock \nwould make this problem worse. \n \n \n7 https://jobsforminnesotans.org/about/board/   \n\n4 \n (2) BlackRock owns stakes in current and prospective MP customers, exacerbating \npressures on institutions, and presenting a clear risk of self-dealing.  \nIn a word, MP already promotes new pipelines and copper mines in Minnesota for its own \nbusiness reasons that are not necessarily in the broader public interest, exerting signiﬁcant \npolitical pressure to do so. Meanwhile, Blackrock owns stakes in three of MPs largest \ncurrent customers: Cleveland Cli Ưs, US Steel, and Enbridge , and 6% of Glencore (which \nowns PolyMet).8 If Blackrock is allowed to acquire MP, it would own ﬁnancial stakes in \nthese very same potential pipeline and copper mine customers that MP already promotes. \nThis would create even more incentive for the public utility to push them in the regulatory \nprocess whatever the ultimate impact on the public interest.  \nThe pressure on Minnesota’s local politicians and regulatory institutions is already intense, \nand we know the current structure already disempowers local elected o Ưicials and \nratepayers. Allowing Blackrock – with its $11T under management -- to own MP while it also \nowns signiﬁcant stakes in the LI customers it serves would clearly exacerbate these \npressures against the public interest. This clear incentive for self-dealing is reason enough \nalone to reject this proposed acquisition. \n(3) Underlying All of This, Global Emissions Continue to Increase  \nUnderlying this entire picture of a growth agenda being out of step with public interest is \nthe bigger picture of carbon emissions worldwide. Global carbon emissions continue to \nincrease year over year, and overall carbon content in the atmosphere continues to \nincrease as well. This global context further dictates that Blackrock’s agenda, along with \nMP customers in which it owns a stake, of “more” is not in the public interest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/blackrock-voted-against-glencores-climate-\nprogress-report-2023-09-06/   \n5 \n Annual carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions worldwide from 1940 to 20249 \n \n10 \n \n9 Statista, January 25, 2025 https://www.statista.com/statistics/276629/global-co2-emissions/   \n10 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2022. https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/carbon-\ndioxide-now-more-than-50-higher-than-pre-industrial-levels   \n\n6 \n Conclusion \nThe public has an interest in clean energy, in conservation, in how energy is distributed, in \nequity, in rates, in local control, arguably in reducing energy consumption overall. An \ninvestor-owned utility has an interest in proﬁt and – apparently – in selling more energy in \ngeneral. Allowing Blackrock – with its $11T under management -- to own Minnesota Power \nwhile it also owns signiﬁcant stakes in the large industrial customers would supercharge \nthese incentives to bring more load and infrastructure online and further strain regulatory \ninstitutions and local control. We do not need to wait for these things to happen to know \nthat they will happen. We can simply know that they will happen based on the evidence \nthat abounds around us. \nI urge you to ﬁnd this proposed transaction not in the public interest . If anything, to truly \nalign the interests of MP with the public interest, we should be moving in the direction of \ncooperative or public ownership.  \nFinally, I would invite you to give no weight to the dates set forth in the proposed purchase \nagreement in terms of your decision-making timelines. Those dates are the business of the \nparties to the contract, not the State of Minnesota, and should not bear any relevance to \nMinnesota’s public decision making. \nThank you. \nJT Haines \nDuluth, Minnesota \n(612) 743-7781"

INTRODUCTION\nIn this docket, ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power1 seeks approval of the\nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission ( “Commission ”) for the Company to  be acquired \nby Global Infrastructure Partners ( “GIP”) and Canada Pension Plan Investments Board \n(“CPP Investments ”) (GIP and CPP Investments are, collectively, the “Partners ” to the \n“Acquisition” ) – and in doing so, approving what may be the most significant transaction \nin Minnesota Power’s history  to strengthen the Company  and support its vision for a \nsustainable , clean energy future.  \nIt is important to underscore, as the Company’s detailed testimony shows, that the \ndecision to enter into the Acquisition was the result of a lengthy, robust,  and carefully \nthought -out and executed process. Consistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company \nand with a laser focus on the needs of customers and employees, t he current ALLETE \nBoard of Directors  (“ALLETE Board”) , chaired by its Chief Executive Officer, sought a \npath that would enable  Minnesota Power to finance its obligations to continue providing \nsafe and reliable service despite aging infrastructure and system investment needs, its \nrequirement to meet the State of Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard, and to provide long -\nterm financial stability to the Company.  It did not pursue an auction process; nor was the \nBoard constrained in its options as some intervenors have (incorrectly) claimed in this \nproceeding. Rather, Company leadership sought out, narrowed down to, and ultimately \nchose pa rtners with the financial capability, dedication, stable operations, commitment to \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Initial Brief “Minnesota \nPower ” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically defined, \nreferences to “ALLETE ” indicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota Power \nand all regulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company ” is a more general reference to ALLETE, \nInc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n \n2 \n state regulation, aligned vision, and commitment to ALLETE as it exists today – allowing \nthe Company to maintain its customer focus, employee commitment, location and \ncommunity presence, management and leadership, operations and strategy, and \ncontinuing fo cus on the clean energy transition.2 Moreover, the Partners worked together \nto establish a post-Acquisition governance  structure  in which no one Partner will have a \nmajority control of the future ALLETE Board and each Partner acts as a check on the \nother.3 Throughout this regulatory process, the Partners have made clear they support \nand are aligned with Minnesota Power’s role and place before the Commission , and with \nthe Company’s continuing relationships with its stakeholders.  \nThe Commission has long acknowledged that Minnesota Power, whose capital \nplan makes up more than 87 percent  of ALLETE,4 has a unique customer base and a \nuniquely risky profile.5 Large, energy -intensive industrial customers make up 56 percent \nof Minnesota Power’s retail sales , and demand electricity 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek  – except that their businesses involve  highly cyclical operations .6 Despite this \ncyclicality, Minnesota Power has an ongoing obligation to ensure the integrity of its assets \nand continue with the clean energy transition – which requires more equity capital  in the \nnext five years than ALLETE has had to raise in its 75 years of public market \n \n2 Ex. MP -1 at Attachment L Page 55 -59 (Petition); Ex. MP -9 at 8 (Cady Direct).  \n3 Ex. MP -14 at 21 (Bram Direct).  \n4 Ex. MP -11 at 3 (Taran Direct) (The Company’s “five -year capital expenditure projections for regulated \noperations . . . accounted for 87 percent of the ALLETE Consolidated capital expenditures.”)  \n5 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E015/GR -16-644, FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS , AND ORDER  at 53 (March 12, \n2018); In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric \nService in Minnesota , Docket No. E015/GR -21-335, FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS , AND ORDER  at 63 \n(Feb. 28, 2023).   \n6 Ex. MP -45 at 11 (ALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10 -K) (“In 2024, industrial customers represented 56 percent \nof total regulated utility [kilowatt -hour] sales.”)  \n \n3 \n participation.7 More than half of the new capital expenditures anticipated in the next five \nyears have already been approved by the Commission through new transmission projects \nnecessary to serve the public;8 this total does not account for additional future generation \nneeds with coal retirements on the known horizon. Requiring ALLETE to raise close to \nthis level of capital in the public markets  that are  inherently subject to volatility and  market \ndisruption – which would be particularly acute right now but for the pending Acquisition – \nnot only places the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient equity at very high risk, but also \naffects the cost of capital to customers. By pursuing the Acquisition with these Partners, \nthe Company is mitigat ing these risks for customers .  \nAt the same time, the Company fully understand s that the Partners , like any \ninvestor,  seek the kind of predictable, fair returns historically approved by the Commission  \nand anticipate that there are benefits  of owning an energy company that increases its \nvalue by leaning into clean, reliable, renewable power , customer service,  and ensuring \nadequate infrastructure to support these goals . Both Minnesota Power and the Partners \nhave acknowledged repeatedly throughout this proceeding that any of their goals, \nassumptions, scenarios, or plans regarding utility resource development, customer \nprograms, rates, returns on investment, capital structure and financing/borrowing, any \nsubsequent acquisition, and more are all subject to Commission and stakeholder review \nand ultimately the decisions of the Commission.  In short, the Partners are acquiring an \nestablished company within a known regulatory construct – not any particular financial \nscenario or outcome.   \n \n7 Ex. MP -29 at 3 (Taran Rebuttal). It is important to underscore that Minnesota Power was only first traded \non the NY Stock Exchange in 1950; before that time, it was a private investor -owned utility.  \n8 Ex. MP -29 at 13 -14 (Taran Rebuttal).  \n \n4 \n Parties to this proceeding narrowly focus on only two perceived potential benefits: \naccess to capital, and partner expertise.9 Access to capital is the reason for the \nAcquisition, but neither of these are the sole benefits of it.  Nor is the standard for approval \nwhether the  Acquisition is ne cessary , but rather whether the Acquisition is in the public \ninterest.10 There is extensive  speculation in  the record about whether the size of the \nCompany’s capital plans is too large or will play out as currently forecast  and whether it \nis better to access  capital in the public markets  simply because that is what ALLETE has \ndone in the past.  Even if these concerns were substantiated by more than speculation in \ntestimony (which they are not), they miss the fundamental point:  Even if Minnesota \nPower’s capital needs are ultimately lower than anticipated, and even if the Company \ncould access capital in the public markets, as the Department  of Commerce ’s (the \n“Department”)  witne ss agreed customers would still receive substantial benefits from this \ntransaction that simply are not possible in the public markets . These include  (but are in \nno way limited to):  \n• Committed funding of Minnesota Power’s five -year capital plan.11  \n• Guarantee of no dividends outside of ALLETE’s capital structure regardless of \nthe amount of capital needs, unless the Company has an investor -grade credit \nrating.12  \n• Reduction of costs in the form of no investor relations or flotation costs and \nreduced Board of Directors’ costs.13  \n• Absorption of $3.5 million of arrears from Minnesota Power’s most vulnerable \ncustomers.14  \n \n9 See Ex.

What is inherently lacking in intervenor testimony, however, is \na balancing of the actual likelihood of those concerns occurring, analysis of whether and \nto what extent such perceived risks also apply to publicly -traded investor -owned utilities \n(including those currently regulated by the Commission), and whether or to wh at extent \neither the Commission’s inherent authority or the additional protections proposed in this \nproceeding (or both) mitigate or remove the perceived risk.  Additionally, intervening \nparties raise conflicting concerns.  As key examples:  \n• At least one party expresses concern the  Company should not make the level of \ninvestments necessary to meet the Carbon Free  Standard ( “CFS”)21 and the \nresulting or modeled potential utility rates on the one hand,22 whereas other parties \n \n15 Id. at 571:7 -571:17.  \n16 Id. \n17 Id. \n18 Id. at 572:1 -572:24.  \n19 Id.  \n20 Id.  \n21 Ex. LPI -1002 at 43 (Walters Direct).  \n22 Ex. LPI -1002 at 43 (Walters Direct); Ex. OAG -402 at 11 -12. Indeed, the LPI collation of large power \ncustomers seems most concerned about the costs of the CFS – which are not dependent on the Acquisition \n– and wanting “net benefits ” for these industrial customers rather than the applicable statutory standard.  \n \n6 \n reflect concern the Company might not make (or the Partners might not fund) the \nlevel of investments necessary to meet the C FS.23 Not only is it up to the \nCommission to decide what level and kinds of utility investments to approve – and \nto evaluate and re -evaluate regularly through resource plans, permitting, rate \ncases, rider filings, and the like – but each of these concerns exist s equally in the \npublic markets.  \n• Similarly, Sierra Club raises the potential for the Partners to sell their shares in \nALLETE before the end of the cessation of coal -fired generation at the Boswell \nEnergy Center24 while simply ignoring the equivalent potential (and more likely \nscenario given the Partners’ statements in this proceeding) for the Partners to see \nthe cessation of coal -fired generation at the Boswell Energy Center through to its \ncompletion  and that the Partners would need Commission approval to exit if and \nwhen they seek to do so .25 In contrast, current shareholders of ALLETE could exit \ntheir ownership at any time without Commission approval , including those \nshareholders that currently own outsized percentages of the Company.  \n• The Department  expresses concern about the level of debt that might be taken on \nat the Alloy Parent LLC (“Alloy Parent”)26 level, without acknowledging the \nCommission’s oversight of both Minnesota Power and ALLETE’s capital structure, \nthat ALLETE’s current equity ratio is materially higher than other utility holding \ncompanies, and that the Partners have objective financial in centives to not over -\nleverage their own investment. The parties also fail to constructively evaluate the \nspecifics of the ring -fencing provisions (including the potential to withhold \ndividends if ALLETE is not financially healthy) offered by the Partners a nd the \nCompany.  \n• Multiple parties raise concerns the Partners might not adhere to their commitment \nto fund Minnesota Power’s five -year plan. However, each ignores that the public \nmarkets provide literally no assurance of funding any particular company’s capital \nplan, and no party gives credence to the Commission’s authority and statutory \nrights to enforce commitments embodied in its own orders.  \n• Multiple parties raised concerns that the Partners would be appointing certain \nALLETE Board directors in addition to the independent directors. Such critique \nignores that ALLETE’s Board is currently made up of directors elected by the \ncurrent shareholders. Further, this critique ignores that today, any one shareholder \ncould either run a campaign for their preferred director to be elected or even \n \n23 Ex.

Specifically, the Company and Partners \nidentified concerns raised in testimony into the following areas and identified \ncommitments in each to significantly mitigate or remove such concerns altogether , which \nare provided in ATTACHMENT A  to this Brief . These topical areas include:  \n• Financial Commitments to Minnesota Power  \n• Capital structure (Equity and Debt)  \n• Corporate Separateness/Ring -Fencing  \n• Books and Records  \n• Affiliated Interests  \n• Governance  \n• Ratemaking and Affordability  \n• Workforce and Labor Protections  \n• Core Values and Environmental Commitments27  \n \n27 ATTACHMENT A  to this Initial Brief combines  Ex. MP -27, Schedule 1 (Cady Rebuttal) and Ex. MP -16, \nSchedule EL -3 to Lapson Direct  (which is incorporated by reference to the Witness Cady’s Schedule 1).  \nThese documents are already in the record, and are included here solely for ease of reference , as they \n \n \n8 \n The Company and the Partners fully anticipate the Commission would include \nthese commitments in any Order approving the Acquisition, including the agreement to \nfully fund Minnesota Power’s five-year capital plan as described in  its most recent Form \n10-K. In doing so, the Partners commit that any failure to comply with any conditions the \nCommission orders will be a violation of the Commission’s order under Minnesota law, \nand enforceable against the entity for whom the action (or non -action) is required.28  \nFundamentally, many of the parties raise questions about the intentions and/or \ntransparency of the Partners, primarily based on generalizations about “private equity ” \n(without differentiating between types of private equity investors, let alone differentiating \nhighly -respected infrastructure and pension fund entities),29 or because the Partners \nmaintain certain documents as highly confidential. To be clear , Minnesota Power  has \nworked with these Partners directly for the nearly two years ; that Minnesota Power  has \nbeen in due diligence, bidding , and negotiation processes “across the aisle ” from these \nPartners to reach agreement on the Acquisition and Merger Agreement ; and that \nMinnesota Power  has closely worked alongside the  Partners  in the regulatory approval \n \nform the basis of the commitments the Company would anticipate being included in any Order approving \nthe Acquisition.  \n28 See Minn. Stat. §216B.54. (“Whenever the commission or department shall be of the opinion that any \nperson  or public utility is failing or omitting or is about to fail or omit to do anything required of it … by any \norder of the commission , or is doing anything or about to do anything, or permitting anything or about to \npermit anything to be done, contrary to or in violation of … any order of the commission , it shall refer the \nmatter to the attorney general who shall take appropriate legal action.) (emphasis added). “Person” is \ndefined in Minn. Stat. § 216B.02, subd. 3 and includes partnerships and corporations, including the Partners \nand Alloy Parent. Minn.  Stat. § 216B.57 also provides that any person, as defined, who knowingly and \nintentionally violates or fails to obey a Commission order is subject [from that point] to financial penalties.  \n29 In contrast, see  Ex. LIUNA -852 at 3-5 (Bryant Rebuttal), differentiating between activist hedge funds that \nhave targeted publicly traded companies ; noting that “we have found many private equity fund managers \nto be willing to make more meaningful commitments to responsible contracting and other practices that \npromote sustainability and mitigate risk compared to publicly -traded companies that often view regulatory \nrequirements as a ceiling r ather than a floor for responsible conduct ”; and explaining Laborers’ International \nUnion of North America’s (“ LIUNA ”) direct knowledge via its “strong relationship and successful track \nrecord ” with GIP in particular.  \n \n9 \n processes. Throughout these processes, the Partners have conducted themselves with \nintegrity , listened to the suggestions of the Company,  and done exactly what they have \nstated in testimony they would do: supported and respected Company leadership and the \nregulatory process. It is highly notable that when given the specific opportunity to test the \nPartners’ integrity in a live setting through cross -examination, each and every party \ncontesting this Acquisition waived their right to do so, rather than risk further affirming  that \nthe Partners mean what they say. Moreover, what is missing from the parties’ claims is \nthat acting with integrity does not require any entity to agree with other parties in a \ncontested case, nor to publicize highly sensitive trade secret documents – particularly \nwhen representatives of the intervening parties, as well as the Administrative Law Judge \n(“ALJ”), Commission, Commission Staff, and an unlimited number of persons at the \nDepartment and the Office of the Attorney General  – Reside ntial Utilities Division  (“OAG ”) \n– are able to assess and review any non -privileged document in the course of the \nproceeding and to test their theories and make evidence -based  decisions.  \nWhen each issue is evaluated, the record demonstrates that the “risks, ” \n“concerns, ” and “negative effects ” identified by the parties are each largely  speculative , \nwith virtually no evidence that any will actually occur or even have a probability of \noccurring. Further, many of the speculative negative outcomes do not account for the \ncritical role of the Commission in approving virtually every aspect of the regulated utility \nbusiness, nor with the additional protections afforded by Minnesota Power and the \nPartners, as well as the affirmative benefits not availabl e absent the Acquisition.  \nMinnesota Power will remain an investor -owned public utility, regulated by the \nCommission in virtually all aspects of its business. ALLETE will remain in its current form \n \n10 \n that has served customers exceptionally well for generations, with the capability to \ncontinue doing so and to meet the call of State policy. Additionally, multiple thoughtful \ncommunity partners, stakeholders, employees, and employee groups, and customer \nadvocates – many with knowledge and experience with either these Partners individually \nor private infrastructure models – have voiced their support. The Acquisition is consistent \nwith the public interest and such a conclusion is supported by the record in th is \nproceeding.  \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nThe proposed Acquisition  is governed by  Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, which requires \nCommission approval before  a public utility  may “sell, acquire, lease, or rent any plant as \nan operating unit or system in this state for a total consideration in excess of $1,000,000, \nor merge or consolidate with another public utility or transmission company operating in \nthis state .” Under this statute, the Commission must assess whether the  Acquisition  is \n“consistent with the public interest .”30 If the Commission finds that the Acquisition  is \nconsistent with the public interest, it  must issue an order approving the Acquisition .31 \nTo determine if the Acquisition  is “consistent with the public interest, perceived \ndetriments or concerns must be weighed against perceived benefits to the public. If the \nperceived detriments do not outweigh the perceived benefits, the merger is deemed to be \n‘consistent with the public interest. ’”32 Although the Commission uses a balancing test to \n \n30 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd. 1.  \n31 Id. \n32 In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Company for Approval to Merge with New \nCentury Energies, Inc ., Docket No. E,G -002/PA -99-1031, ORDER APPROVING MERGER , AS CONDITIONED  \n(“NSP/NCE  MERGER ORDER ”) at 7 (June 12, 2000).  \n \n11 \n determine if the Acquisition  is consistent with the public interest,33 a finding that the \nAcquisition  results in net benefits is not required . Rather, in prior cases, the  Commission \nhas consistently held that  the public interest standard  does not require an affirmative \nfinding of public benefit, but requires  only a finding that a transaction is compatible with \nthe public interest.34 The Commission has also stated that Minn. Stat. §  216B.50 “does \nnot require that proposed mergers affirmatively benefit ratepayers or the public or that \nthey otherwise promote the public interest. ”35 To satisfy this standard, the Acquisition  \nmerely “cannot contravene the public interest . . . and must be shown to be compatible \nwith it. ”36 \nIII. ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED  \nOn October 7, 2024, the Commission issued its Order in the Acquisition Docket.37 \nIn that Order, the Commission referred this matter to the OAH to develop a record on the \nfollowing issues:  \nA. Are there potential harms to the public interest from the proposed \ntransaction, including in relation to cost or risk?38 \nB. Are there any potential benefits to ratepayers, Minnesota, or the public \ninterest from the proposed transaction?39 \n \n33 In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Acquisition by MDU Resources Group, Inc., and its Division, \nGreat Plains Natural Gas Company, of Cascade Natural Gas Corporation , Docket No. G -004/PA -06-1585, \nORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION , WITH CONDITIONS  at 2 (Mar. 23, 2007).  \n34 See, e.g., id.; In the Matter of a Request for Approval of the Acquisition of the Stock of Natrogas, \nIncorporated (Natrogas), a Merger of Northern States Power Company (NSP) and Western Gas Utilities, \nInc.

Considering all relevant factors and applicable law, is the proposed \ntransaction consistent with the public interest?40 \nD. Are there regulatory requirements or commitments necessary to render the \nproposed transaction consistent with the public interest?41 \nE. How do relevant and related dockets pending before the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and/or \nother state, federal or foreign government agencies impact the \nCommission’s consideration of the proposed transactio n?42 \nF. How will the acquisition impact Minnesota Power’s union and non -union \nworkforce and do the protections included in the acquisition agreement \nadequately protect that workforce?43 \nG. How will the acquisition impact Minnesota Power’s ability to comply with the \ncarbon -free standard under [Minn. Stat.] §  216B.1691, including any \nmodifications of plan associated with the Nemadji Trail Energy Center?44 \nAs discussed in further detail below, the evidentiary record has been fully developed on \nthese issues. Ultimately, a review of Issues A (potential harms), B (potential benefits), F \n(workforce impacts), and G (ability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard under Minn. \nStat.] §  216B.1691 ) illustrate that the affirmative benefits of the transaction far outweigh \nperceived risks or potential harm . This is underscored by the fact that the FERC and the \nPublic Service Commission of Wisconsin, as well as other gove rnment agencies, have all \napproved the transaction (Issue E). Ultimately, the substantial evidence in the record \nillustrates that the Acquisition is consistent with the public interest (Issue C), particularly \nwith incorporation of the Company’s and the Par tner’s propose d commitments into a \nbinding Commission order (Issue D). Accordingly, the Company requests that the \n \n40 Id. at Order Point 3(C).  \n41 Id. at Order Point 3(D).  \n42 Id. at Order Point 3(E).  \n43 Id. at Order Point 3(F).  \n44 Id. at Order Point 3(G).  \n \n13 \n Administrative Law Judge recommend approval of the Acquisition, and that the \nCommission ultimately accept that recommendation.  \nIV. CONSIDERATION OF BENEFITS, POTENTIAL HARMS, AND PROPOSED \nCOMMITMENTS WARRANT APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION45  \nAs noted above, the  Commission ordered the evaluation of the “potential harms to \nthe public interest ” and the “potential benefits to ratepayers ” in this proceeding. It is \nimportant to ground the evaluation of the Acquisition in the following: all risks raised to \nthis point are “potential ” whereas the benefits of the Acquisition are real and tangible. Not \nonly are there benefits for Minnesota Power’s customers, but there are benefits for \nMinnesota Power’s employees, the local economies within Minnesota Power’s service \nterritory, and Minneso ta as a whole. These cannot be ignored , as the agencies and certain \nintervening parties advocate.  Below , the Co mpany walks through the risks and potential \nharms identified by varying parties to the proceeding  and balances them against the \nbenefits – including both affirmative new advantages to stakeholders and carefully \nstructured protections against perceived potential harm. Taken individually and as a \nwhole, there can be no doubt the Acquisition is a net ben efit to the public interest – even \nexceeding the “consistent with the  public interest ” standard .  \nA. Financial Commitments to Minnesota Power  \nThe record shows that the Company has a significant need for capital investment \nat unprecedented levels in the near term . As explained by several Company witnesses , \nthis is so that ALLETE , whose capital needs are driven by Minnesota Power , can meet \nits carbon -free goals , including compliance with Minnesota ’s 2040 CFS, while continuing \n \n45 Issues A, B, C, and D, set forth in the Order at 12.  \n \n14 \n to provide safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers.46 According to Witness \nTaran , the amount of equity that  Minnesota Power  will need to  raise over the next five  \nyears  for this purpose is  approximately equal to the amount of  equity that  Minnesota \nPower  has needed to raise over  the past 75 years .47 Specifically, since the  Company  was \nfirst listed on the  New York Stock Exchange  in 1950 , the Company has  raised \napproximately  $1.3 billion through  follow -on equity offerings.48 However, to fund the  \nCompany’s  $4.8 billion five -year capital plan , roughly half of which pertains to \ntransmission projects that have already been approved by this Commission, with \nadditional solar and transmission projects approved by the Commission or the \nMidcontinent Independent System Operator ( “MISO ”), respectively, the Company  will \nneed to  raise  over $1 billion in common equity  over the next five years , which will require \nannual  secondary offerings .49 As shown in Figure 1  below, which is a reproduction of \nFigure 1 in the Direct Testimony of  Witness Taran , the Company’s capital plan  represents \na substantial  increase compared to  historical investments :50 \n \n46 Ex. MP -11 at 7 (Taran Direct); Ex. MP -10 at 11 (Scissions Direct); Ex. MP -9 at 13 (Cady Direct).  \n47 Ex. MP -29 at 3 ( Taran Rebuttal ).  \n48 Ex. MP -29 at 3 (Taran Rebuttal).  \n49 Ex.

ALLETE Regulated Operations – Historical and Forecasted Capital \nExpenditures ($ in Millions)  \n \nAs explained by  Witnesses  Taran  and Quackenbush , it is unlikely that ALLETE \nwould  be able to raise sufficient  capital from the public markets  to fund its capital plan , \ngiven the size of the equity need , the volatility of the public market , and the lack of \nflexibility that ALLETE would  face.51 These challenges also conflict with the testimony  of \nWitness Lane , who argues, without any evidence, that approving the Acquisition creates \na risk that the Partners could interfere with Minnesota Power’s compliance with the CFS.52 \nInstead , attempts to raise the needed capital from the public markets  through large, \nfrequent secondary offerings , which would be necessary without the Acquisition,  could \nresult in  significant harm to  Minnesota Power and its customers .53 Put bluntly, there is the \npotential that the Company may not be able to meet the CFS without the Acquisition.  This \nis further supported by Witness Scissons  who testified that “it would be highly unlikely the \nCompany could achieve its carbon free goals as planned ” without the Acquisition.54 \n \n51 Ex.

MP -28 at 9-10 (Scissons Rebuttal ).  \n\n \n16 \n Moreover, the record is replete  with additional evidence  as to the risks if ALLETE \nhad to raise the capital needed  from the public markets. For example, Witness Taran \ntestified that  ALLETE would have  difficulty raising sufficient capital for its future needs \nwithout the Acquisition55 and that attempting to do so in the public markets creates an \nenormous amount of risk for the Company and its stakeholders .56 In fact,  Witness Taran  \ntestified that it would not be responsible for the Company to move forward on the \nassumption that it could meet its capital needs through the public markets.57 Similarly, \nWitness Quackenbush agreed that ALLETE would face challenges in accessing the \nneeded capital from the public markets.58 In addition, Witness Bram  explained that the \nidea that ALLETE , as a publicly traded utility, “could  access public equity at the scale and \npace that is needed is not based on reality  and would likely result in significant challenges \nfor the utility .”59 \nSome parties  attempt to downplay these risks  of attempting to raise capital on a \nstand -alone basis . However, the record shows that  ALLETE ’s outsized capital needs \nrelative to its size  means that the Company will need to  tap the capital markets  repeatedly \nto raise required capital ,60 risking public  market investor fatigue  and eliminating timing  \nflexibility .61 In turn, this lack of flexibility  means that  ALLETE  will be forced to sell its stock  \nregardless of stock market volatility  and at low prices  – a known and not hypothetical or \npotential outcome .62 Issuing a greater number of shares  at a low price to  raise a block of  \n \n55 Ex.

MP -30 at 13 (Quackenbush Rebuttal).  \n \n17 \n equity  results in dilution , which will disincentivize future  investment in ALLETE  and lower \nthe Company ’s cash flow , a primary measure of financial health, through  increased \ndividend payments .63 Dilution will also  harm customers , as shareholders will see  the stock \nas higher risk  and demand a higher return .64 Customers also benefit  from a financially \nhealthy utility  and would be harmed by a  continuous downward spiral  caused by serial  \nissuances .65 Further, based on evaluation and diligence completed by the Company, \nproceeding without the Acquisition could lead to delays in projects being completed – \nwhether for CFS compliance or other system or regional reliability needs – along with the \nhigher cost of capital .66 \nThese concerns demonstrate the  significant benefit of raising  equity capital with  \npatient private investors that  have the ability to inject  capital  regardless of  negative \nexternal factors  (such as large customer operational suspensions) as well as a vested \ninterest  to do so  to ensure the long -term success of their  investment .67 The Partners  are \nable to inject  equity capital  or adjust dividend payments  much more flexibly than  public \ninvestors  that expect quarterly dividend payments  and respond to  missed or reduced \npayments  by selling their shares , reducing share price , and demanding higher returns  as \ncompensation for higher risk .68 \n \n63 Ex.

Capital Structure (Equity and Debt)  \nAs explained by Witness Taran , utilities typically fund their operations through a \nmix of equity and debt to balance financial considerations and risk management.84 While \ndebt financing is generally lower cost than equity financing,  it adds financial risk  due to \nthe obligation to make interest payments , which places pressure on  credit ratings .85 Thus, \nutilities seek  a balanced capital structure that  allows for just and reasonable rates  while \nmaintaining access to  capital at competitive rates  on behalf of customers.86 Importantly, \n \n80 Ex.

Specifically, the Department and \nCURE’s witnesses speculate that  the Partners  are private equity investors  that are likely \nto seek higher returns on their investment in ALLETE than public equity investors (without \nacknowledging the role of the Commission to ensure only reasonable returns to investors \nof any kind) and to employ financial engineering strategies to increase the ir returns , \nultimately harming the financial health of  Minnesota Power .89 For example, Witness \nAddonizio  expresses concern that  the Partners will issue debt at Alloy Parent, outside of \nMinnesota Power’s approved capital structure , and thereby over -leverage ALLETE .90 In \ndoing so, Witness Addonizio fails to acknowledge that issuing debt at a parent company \nlevel is not unique to private investors, to privately  owned energy companies, or to \nALLETE, but rather commonly how debt is raised.91 Nonetheless, Witness Addonizio also \n \n87 Ex.

In addition to these concerns being largely \nacademic in nature,94 the theory behind them applies equally to public stockholders as to \nprivate infrastructure funding, as ultimately acknowledged by Witness Addonizio.95 The \napproaches described by  the Department and CURE’s witnesses  also run counter to the  \nPartners’  investment strategies.  For example, as explained by  Witness  Alley , while CPP \nInvestments  (a pension fund investor with  an investment -only mandate ), like any investor,  \naims to generate returns on its investments , its energy infrastructure investments  focus \non returns from  sustainable, long -term investments  instead of from short -run profits  or \noperational turnarounds , or from financial  engineering strategies that  might be more \ncommon with  a stereotypical private equity  investor .96 Likewise,  Witness  Bram  explains \nthat GIP  is not investing in  ALLETE  to use strategies for  the purpose of extracting value  \nin the short -term.97 GIP’s investment in ALLETE  is intended to be long -term, with a focus \non investing further in  and supporting ALLETE  to ensure that it can achieve its  clean \nenergy objectives and  continue to successfully serve customers .98 Indeed, the success \n \n92 Ex.

[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE \nSECRET INFORMATION BEGINS…  \n100…HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS]  However, this concern fails to recognize that the  Partners  are \nusing a limited amount of  debt ($300 million out of a $ 3.9 billion purchase price ) to fund \nthe Acquisition , which materially limits the  amount of leverage  (and which makes it very \ndifferent from other  transactions of this nature ).101 In addition, the levels of any  future debt \nthat will be incurred  are simply to ensure  the efficient deployment of  capital as well as  a \nproper capital structure and  strong credit metrics at  Alloy Parent .102 Rather than over -\nleverage , this is a reasonable approach to  debt.

These commitments provide an important benefit: they demonstrate that \nMinnesota Power and its customers will be appropriately protected and separated from \nany business and financial risks  perceived to be associated with the Partners, as \nsuggested by various agencies and intervenors in this proceeding. Further, Witness \nLapson explained how these com mitments minimize potential harm from the \nTransaction.124  \n \n123 Id. \n124 Ex. MP -36 at 4 (Lapson Rebuttal).  \n28 1. The Ring -fencing Commitments\nRing-fencing is a term used to describe arrangements that keep a regulated utility \nbusiness separate from the non -utility affiliates or holding company parent of the utility. \nAs Witness Lapson explained, “ring-fencing mechanisms have been  successfully used to \nprotect utilities from risky parents or affiliated companies and have  proven effective in \nallowing the Protected Companies to carry out their mandate to serve  present and future \ncustomers. ”125 \nMany of ALLETE’s ring -fencing commitments were established at pages 19 -20 of \nthe Petition.126 The key commitments include : \n•ALLETE and Alloy Parent will maintain separate books and records, agree to\nprohibitions against loans or pledges of assets of ALLETE without regulatory\napproval, and generally hold ALLETE harmless from any business and financial\nrisk exposures associated w ith Alloy Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates (other\nthan any subsidiary of ALLETE);\n•ALLETE and Alloy Parent will maintain separate stock and debt;\n•Neither ALLETE nor Alloy  Parent shall provide direct credit support to a credit\nfacility of  the other through a guarantee, and none of ALLETE’s credit facilities\nshall include any  cross -default provision whereby a default under any of Alloy\nParent’s credit facilities would  cause a default under any of ALLETE’s credit\nfacilities;\n•ALLETE will maintain its own corporate and debt rating, and its own ratings for\nlong-term debt;  and\n•ALLETE will be structured such that, in the event of a bankruptcy of Alloy Parent\nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (other than ALLETE and its subsidiaries),\na bankruptcy court will not consolidate the assets and liabilities of ALLETE with\nAlloy Parent or any Alloy  Parent entity, and except as allowed by law, any costs\nincurred as a result of the bankruptcy of Alloy Parent or any Alloy Parent entity\ncannot be sought from ALLETE.127\n125 Ex.

Witness Anderson confirmed that Alloy Parent will have \nseparate financial accounts from ALLETE – the accounts of the two will not be \ncommingled.128 In addition, ALLETE will not be an obligor on the debt that Alloy Parent is \nincurring in connection with the Acquisition.129 Witness Anderson noted that the \nCommission will have the authority and opportunity to confirm these ring -fencing \narrangements as Minnesota Power continues to file its annual corporate structure petition \nand other compliance filings.130 In rebuttal, the Company and the Partners committed to \ntwo additional ring -fencing commitments:  \n• Alloy Parent will not use utility assets to guarantee Alloy Parent debt; and  \n• Minnesota Power will be prohibited from loaning funds to or borrowing funds \nfrom Alloy Parent or other upstream entities.131  \nWitness Lapson prepared a useful list of all of the Company’s ring -fencing \ncommitments.132 The commitments were also summarized and reaffirmed by ALLETE \nwitness Jennifer Cady.133 The Company and Partners anticipate  inclusion of the ring -\nfencing commitments as requirements in the final order in this Acquisition proceeding , so \nthat these commitments are memorialized and subject to the enforcement authority of the \nCommission . \n \n128 Ex.

Witness Lapson’s Analysis of the Ring -Fencing Commitments  \nWitness Lapson has extensive experience analyzing the adequacy and \nappropriateness of ring -fencing measures in the context of a utility transaction.134 In \ncontrast to witnesses of the agencies and the intervening parties, Witness Lapson has \ndeveloped a set of systematic and comprehensive standards regarding the protection of \na company from adversity as a result of its affiliation with a parent or affilia ted entities that \nhas been used in multiple regulatory proceedings where acquisitions have been approved \nby state regulatory commissions.135 \nWitness Lapson’s framework has two tracks. Track I contains practices that allow \nthe Protected Company136 to preserve its own identity, remain viable, fund itself, resist \nincurring liabilities unrelated to its own business, and defend its own assets and liabilities \neven if its parent or an affiliate is in distress.137 Track II contains practices that protect a \ncompany from involuntary consolidation by a bankruptcy court with its parent or affiliate \nin the parent or affiliate’s bankruptcy proceeding.138 \nFor the Acquisition, Witness Lapson analyzed the ring -fencing commitments made \nby ALLETE and the Partners. In doing  so, Witness Lapson  also considered the \nprotections that exist because of the Commission’s regulatory authority over Minnesota \nPower, which will remain unchanged if the Acquisition is approved by the Commission. \nWitness Lapson concluded that the ring -fencing commitments are “strong ”139 and that \n \n134 Ex. MP -16 at 2 -4 (Lapson Direct).  \n135 Ex. MP -16 at 10 -14 and Sch. 2 (Lapson Direct).  \n136 See Ex. MP -16 at 11 -23, Schedule 2 Page 1 of 2 (Lapson Direct). Track I contains practices that allow \nan entity (the Protected Company) to preserve its own identity, remain viable, fund itself, resist incurring \nliabilities unrelated to its own business, and to  defend its own assets and liabilities even if its parent or an \naffiliate of the parent is in distress.  \n137 Ex.

The Ring-Fencing Commitments Are Robust and Appropriate  \nFew parties commented on the ring -fencing commitments , and if they did so , they  \nlargely just downplayed them . For example, Witness Walters essentially brushed off the \ncommitments  listed above , along with various other commitments made by Minnesota \nPower, because they “merely maintain the status quo. ”141 Fundamentally, however, Large \nPower Intervenors (“ LPI”) has taken the position that there must be “net customer \nbenefits ” of the Acquisition, in fundamental contradiction of Minnesota law.142 As such,  \nWitness Walters’ comment reveals his  failure to consider that maintaining the status quo \nfor Minnesota Power , that the Commission has found to be appropriate and protective of \nthe public interest , meets the statutory requirement that the Acquisition be “in the public \ninterest. ” \nWitness Vavro acknowledged that the ring -fencing commitments are “generally \nconsistent with those that have been proposed in other take -private transactions. ”143 \nHowever, Witness Vavro argued that the ring -fencing commitments were nevertheless \ninsufficient, while raising two issues . \nFirst, Witness Vavro proposed a legal non -consolidation opinion as an example of \nhow the Company’s ring-fencing protections could be improved.144 A legal non -\n \n140 Ex.

DOC -301 at 20 (Vavro Direct).  \n \n32 \n consolidation opinion is  a “second opinion, ” prepared by a lawyer, opining that if the \nacquiring company declares bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court would not order the \nsubstantive consolidation of the acquired company.145 However, Witness Lapson , who \nhas actually obtained such opinions under the right circumstances,  testified that such \nopinions are not part of  typical  standards and are not necessary  because “I don't think \nthat [such an opinion] creates any added protection or any protection at all. ”146 Witness \nLapson  also explained that  even where such opinions are obtained,  it is generally “not \npossible to obtain a legal non -consolidation opinion ” before the close of a transaction, \nand that such opinions “are not sought in merger transactions. ”147  \nWitness Vavro asserted in Surrebuttal that in two other recent utility transactions, \nthe acquirer had committed to seek a non -consolidation opinion.148 In those two cases, \nthe requirement to obtain a non -consolidation opinion was offered  as part of a settlement  \n(approved by the commission  but not resulting from  a commission directive  requiring or \nparticularly noting the commitment).  Additionally,  in other situations a  non-consolidation \nopinion was rejected by commission  because they are  expensive and time -consuming to \nobtain relative to the limited value .149 It also became clear that in the two  instance s cited \nby Witness Vavro , the non -consolidation opinion was to be completed after closing \n(consistent with Witness  Lapson’s experience).150 Witness Vavro also conceded that non -\n \n145 Evid.

To begin with,  the Acquisition will not \nresult in any change of the ALLETE family of companies or in any changes to the \narrangements, contracts, and agreements within that family (except for the need for an \nupdated tax sharing agreement) – the existing structure of ALLE TE is not at issue in this \nproceeding.154 The Commission is well aware of ALLETE’s corporate structure, and over \ndecades in which the Company has repeatedly explored and presented information \nregarding the pros and cons of a holding company structure, the Commission has not \nconcluded that anything should be done to change the Company’s existing corporate \nstructure .  \n \n151 Evid. Hrg. Tr. at 478:2 -478:11 (April 2, 2025 ) (Vavro).  \n152 Ex. MP -16 at 15 (Lapson Direct), Ex. MP -36 at 11 -12 (Lapson Rebuttal).  \n153 Ex. DOC -301 at 20 (Vavro Direct).  \n154 Ex. MP -15 at 7 (Anderson Direct) . \n \n34 \n To the contrary, the Commission has considered the Company’s cost allocations \nprocess, corporate structure, and other attributes to generally be satisfactory.155 As \nWitness Anderson explained, there are already safeguards in place (such as the use of \nseparate corporate entities for non -regulated businesses, and separation between \nMinnesota Power’s assets and ALLETE debt used by non -regulated businesses , as well \nas Commission -approved affiliated interest and cost allocation agreements and \nrequirements ) that provide appropriate and sufficient protection. The Department is well \naware of these safeguards, and in previous proceedings, it has recognized that they are \nsufficient.156 Witness Vavro’s testimony regarding  this issue is  not credible, because it \ncontradicts the Department’s previous position, and it  implies that the Commission has \nfailed in its ongoing regulatory oversight of ALLETE  for decades , which is not reasonable .  \nIndeed, i t is important to consider that i f ALLETE were to organize into a holding \ncompany structure, the result may be that the Commission and other stakeholders would \nhave less transparency into finances at the ALLETE and Alloy Parent levels, at least in \nsome ways, than what ALLETE and the Partners are proposing in the Acquisition. For \nexample, ALLETE is proposing to continue with its annual capital structure filing, and to \ninclude with that filing full audited consolidated financial statements for both ALLETE and \nAlloy P arent. In contrast, the Commission does not receive information about the capital \nstructure or corporate structure of Xcel Energy’s or Otter Tail Power’s holding companies , \ndoes not regulate the consolidated capital structure of either company, and does no t have \n \n155 Witness Vavro emphasizes that formation of a holding company has been a topic of discussion between \nALLETE and the Commission, and that in 2023 ALLETE was considering the submission of a holding \ncompany reorganization petition. Ex. DOC -32 at 13 -14 (Vavro Surrebuttal). But that does not mean \nadoption of a holding company structure is required, would be feasible, or would be wise while the \nAcquisition is taking place. Witness Vavro is merely attempting to muddy the issues . \n156 Ex. MP -50; Evid. Hrg. Tr. at 515:10 -518:6 (April 2, 2025 ) (Addonizio).  \n \n35 \n insight into how debt is raised at the holding company level.157 Further, formation of a \nholding company structure is time -consuming and costly, and would require an additional \nproceeding before the Commission. Moreover, transitioning to a holding company \nstructure, at the same time as implementing the Acquisition, could lead to complex \nunintended consequences.  \nIn sum, the ring -fencing commitments made by ALLETE and the Partners on this \nAcquisition record are appropriate  and more than sufficient  to protect Minnesota Power \nfrom perceived risks associated with Alloy Parent and the Partners. Witness Lapson, the \nonly witness with experience using a set of systematic and comprehensive standards to \nanalyze the adequacy of ring -fencing commitments, concluded that the commitments \nmade by ALLETE a nd the Partners provide “adequate protection in all circumstances. ”158 \nThe ALJ should reach the same conclusion.  \nD. Books and Records  \nMinnesota law provides that the Commission has access to, and can examine, all \nof Minnesota Power’s books and finances.159 In addition, Minnesota Power provides \nextremely detailed and wide -ranging financial information to the Commission in its rate \ncases, rider proceedings, jurisdictional annual reports  and annual affiliated interest filings , \nintegrated resource planning ( “IRP”) and integrated distribution planning ( “IDP”) \nproceedings, annual capital structure filings, and numerous other compliance filings. All \nof this information is made available to the OAG and the Department  as well as the \nCommission , and nearly all of it is available to the general public.  \n \n157 Evid. Hrg. Tr. at 515:10 -518:6 (April 2, 2025 ) (Addonizio).  \n158 Ex. MP -16 at 5 (Lapson Direct).  \n159 Minn. Stat. § 216A.05, subd. 3(3).  \n \n36 \n In the Petition, the Company and the Partners committed that Minnesota Power \nwill continue to provide the Commission with access to its books, records, and \ninformation.160 Recognizing the Acquisition would mean that ALLETE would no longer be \nsubject to Securit ies and  Exchange Commission ( “SEC”) reporting requirements, the \nPetition includes  an attachment illustrating  how all the potentially relevant information \nabout ALLETE available to the Commission post -acquisition will be substantially similar \nto what is available now.161 Witness Anderson provided additional information about \nplanned reporting in Rebuttal Testimony.162 \nNevertheless, several witnesses argued that the discontinuation of ALLETE’s SEC \nreporting would mean that Minnesota Power’s customers and the Commission would \nhave less insight into ALLETE’s finances.163 Their concerns are misplaced, because the \nscope and detail of the information already provided in, and accessible to, the \nCommission and the public through the Company’s filings with the Commission far \nexceeds the scope of financial information presented in SEC reporting. SEC reports such \nas 10Ks are primarily intended to provide information to investors and they only address \na limited number of topics, whereas the information the Company provides to the \nCommission is far broader and addresses the issues t hat are pertinent to the \nCommission’s regulatory role.  \nWitness Vavro expressed concern about the Commission’s access to Minnesota \nPower’s books and records. Witness Vavro asserted that the Company and the Partners \n \n160 Ex. MP -1 at 22 (Petition).  \n161 Ex. MP -1 at Attachment H (Petition).  For ease of reference, a copy is attached hereto as ATTACHMENT \nB. See also  Ex. MP -35 at Section II.C  and Schedule 1 (Anderson Rebuttal).   \n162 Ex.

Sierra Club -1100 at 31 -32 (Lane Direct).   \n \n37 \n “appear unwilling to replicate the level of transparency that is currently provided by \nALLETE to the Commission. ”164 However, as Witness Anderson explained, that “is the \nopposite of what the Company and the Partners have committed to: at present, the \nCommission has access to extremely detailed information about ALLETE’s finances and \nstrategy, and after the Acquisition, the Commission will continue to have exactly th e same \ninformation. ”165 Moreover, the Department has not identified any specific information that \nit want s to review that will not be available in the information the Company is continuing \nto provide or has agreed to provide.  And i f the Department ever perceives that it needs \nadditional information, there are many avenues by which it can seek that information , and \nany such  request s can be addressed when made.   \nWitness Walters similarly argued that SEC filings provide information that is \n“crucial ” for regulators and ratepayers to assess risks that could affect the utility’s \noperations.166 Witness Walters’ concern is quite overstated, because he likewise ignores \nthe information that will continue to be filed by Minnesota Power with the Commission. \nFor example, the Moody’s and S&P credit rating reports for the Company, the compliance \nfilings that are required any time Minnesota Power undertakes a significant (greater than \n$100,000) disposition or acquisition of regulated assets, and the a nnual capital structure \npetition each, in different ways, provide information that might be useful in assessing risk \nor pertinent to other issues that the Commission is focused on.167 \nAlong the same lines as Witness Walters , and Witness Lane suggested that \ndiscontinuation of SEC reporting means that “critical information about the company’s \n \n164 Ex. DOC -301 at 17 (Vavro Direct).  \n165 Ex. MP -35 at 12 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n166 Ex. LPI -1001 at 31 (Walters Direct).  \n167 Ex. MP -35 at 11 -12 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n \n38 \n performance, strategic decisions, and potential risks can be obscured from public \nview. ”168 This is not at all correct. As Witness Anderson explained, there is “far more \ninformation, and far more useful information from a regulatory point of view, about \nMinnesota Power’s performance, strategic decisions, and potential risks in the information \nthat the Company provides to the Commission than there is in any SEC rep ort.”169 Then, \nin surrebuttal, Witness Lane said the concern is that the discontinuation of ALLETE’s SEC \nreporting would mean that the Commission would not have sufficient detailed financial \ninformation about ALLETE’s new parents, GIP and CPP  Investments .170 There is no \nprecedent or basis in law for a corporate parent of a utility to provide unfettered access \nto state regulators in the way Witness Lane seeks.  And again, the  Department and other \nparties  will receive and have access to  full information about Minnesota Power’s utility \noperations , with  many avenues in the multiple Minnesota Power proceedings before the \nCommission a t any given time to request additional  information .  \nDespite these concerns being largely  theoretical , in Rebuttal Testimony, the \nCompany and the Partners, through Witness Anderson, proposed several additional \nmeasures relating to transparency of the Company’s finances:  \n• The Company’s annual capital structure petition will include full audited \nconsolidated financial statements for ALLETE, prepared in accordance with \nGenerally Accepted Auditing Principles ( “GAAP ”). These will include  all of \nthe footnotes , as well as specific supplemental schedules that are currently \nincluded in ALLETE’s Forms 10 -K and 10 -Q. \n• The Company’s annual capital structure petition will  also include full audited \nconsolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP , for \nAlloy Parent.  \n \n168 Ex. Sierra Club -1100 at 31 (Lane Direct).  \n169 Ex. MP -35 at 11 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n170 Ex. Sierra Club -1102 at 27 (Lane Surrebuttal).  \n \n39 \n • The Company will provide compliance filings on equity infusions from and \ndividends to Alloy Parent in the same manner in which the Company \ncurrently provides compliance filings in its capital structure docket.  \n• Access to the books and records of the entities up to and including Alloy \nParent that are related to Minnesota Power’s operations under the \njurisdiction of the Commission will be provided to the Commission after the \nAcquisition.171 \n• Finally, the Company noted that it did not object to inclusion of these \ncommitments as requirements in a binding final Commission order \napproving the Acquisition.172 \nThese additional commitments  will ensure that the Commission and other \nstakeholders have all of the information that could reasonably be relevant and useful.   \nE. Affiliated Interests  \nThe Commission and Minnesota public  utilities have long interpreted Minn. Stat. \n§ 216B.48 and the associated rules governing affiliated interests to apply when an affiliate \nowned in whole or in part by the public utility or the public utility holding company contracts \nwith the public utilit y governed by the Commission. The purpose of these requirements  is \nto allow the Commission to ensure that agreements between affiliated companies are \nreasonable and to identify potential self -dealing that could harm custo mers. Consistent \nwith Minnesota law, Minnesota Power has filed with the Commission (a) affiliated interest \nagreements and tax sharing agreements between it and subsidiaries of ALLETE  and (b)  \nan annual  Affiliated Interest Annual Report ( “Annual Affiliate Report ”). The Annual Affiliate \nReport lists all shareholders that own greater than five percent  of the outstanding shares \nof ALLETE’s stock . Consistent with longstanding practice before the Commission, \n \n171 Ex. MP -35 at 13 -14 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n172 Ex. MP -35 at 14 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n \n40 \n Minnesota regulated electric utilities have not listed in their Annual Affiliate Report the  \nsubsidiar ies or affiliate s of any such shareholder.   \nSpecifically, for a number of years  the shareholders owning more than five percent \nof ALLETE’s outstanding shares have been institutional investors such as BlackRock, \nInc. ( “BlackRock ”) and The Vanguard Group, Inc. ( “Vanguard ”).173 The Commission has \nnot treated other companies owned by BlackRock or Vanguard as being affiliated \ninterests with Minnesota Power that required filings with the Commission. The \nCommission has taken this approach not only as to ALLETE, but it has consistently \napplied this treatment in similar instances to other Minnesota utilities.174 Likewise, \nreporting has not been required or anticipated when two separately -owned public utilities, \neach of whose ultimate shares may be held in an amount greater than five percent by the \nsame shareholder, contract for business together.175 \nThe Commission’s approach recognizes that institutional investors are investors, \nnot operators of public utilities. The Commission’s approach is reasonable —it ensures \nthat enough information is provided to allow stakeholders to analyze affiliated interest \nissues and protect against self -dealing, while avoiding the unworkable task of tracking the \nhundreds or thousands of companies in which institutional investors such as BlackRock \nor Vanguard own a stake. As Commission Staff noted, “It is unlikely that there  are a \nsignificant number of large or medium -sized publicly -traded companies in the United \nStates that Vanguard and/or BlackRock don’t own 5% or more of . . .. Given the nature of \n \n173 Ex. MP -15 at 8 (Anderson Direct).  \n174 Ex. MP -15 at 9 (Anderson Direct).  \n175 Ex. MP -6 at 12 -13 (Supplemental Filing); For example, while Vanguard owns more than five percent of \nthe shares of both ALLETE and Otter Tail Power Company, these utilities do not make an affiliated interest \nfiling when the utilities jointly develop a tran smission line project nor do they include such information in \ntheir Annual Affiliate Reports. S ee Notice of Intent to Construct, Own, and Maintain the Maple River - \nCuyuna 345 kV Transmission Project LRTP Project #20 , Docket No. E015,ET2,E017/CN -25-109.   \n \n41 \n Vanguard and BlackRock, it is likely that virtually every contract that many, if not all our \ninvestor -owned utilities undertake with a public traded corporation – and some privately \nheld businesses – would become ‘affiliated interest’ contracts under the a pproach taken \nby the Department. ”176 \nIn this proceeding, ALLETE and the Partners are not seeking any change in the \nstatus quo relating to affiliated interests. Their position is simply that the Commission’s \ncurrent approach should remain unchanged,  and the approach advocated for by the \nDepartment would require significant changes to reporting and tracking for all Minnesota \npublic utilities. Nevertheless, ALLETE and the Partners are offering more than the status \nquo—as described below, they are proposing to provide more information than other \nMinnesota utilities do.  \n1. The Company and the Partners Have Taken Steps to Minimize the \nRisk of Affiliated Interests  \nThe Company  and the Partners provided a detailed explanation of the measures \nthey will take to provide information about agreements between affiliated companies and \nto identify potential self -dealing that could harm customers. Specifically, Minnesota Power \nwill continue to file all affiliated interest and tax sharing agreements as it has been doing \nand will also continue to file its Annual Affiliate Report.177 The Company committed that \nin that Report, Minnesota Power would  identify all entities directly up the chain of ALLETE \ncorporate ownership, from Alloy Parent up to and including CPP Investments  and GIP.178 \n \n176 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners , Docket No. PA -24-198, STAFF BRIEFING PAPERS  at 21 \n(Sept. 11, 2024).  \n177 Ex. MP -15 at 10 (Anderson Direct). ALLETE and the Partners undertook reasonable diligence and \nascertained that there are not any material contracts between ALLETE and its affiliates and CPP \nInvestments  or GIP and therefore no additional affiliated interest agreements are expected upon the closing \nof the transaction.  \n178 Ex. MP -15 at 11 (Anderson Direct).  \n \n42 \n ALLETE will continue to adhere to its Purchasing Manual, competitive bidding policies, \nRequest for Proposal ( “RFP”) processes, Supplier Code of Conduct, and Code of \nBusiness Conduct, which contain many provisions that minimize the risk of potential self -\ndealing.179 \nIn addition, Minnesota Power will create a new field in its Enterprise Resource \nPlanning ( “ERP”) system, Oracle, allowing it to track and report any transactions with GIP \nand CPP Investments  entities.180 Minnesota Power will annually require all suppliers, and \nany industrial customers with contracted rates, to fill out a questionnaire identifying \nwhether they are more than five percent owned by GIP, CPP Investments, or \nBlackRock.181 Those suppliers will be listed in the Annual Report.182 Further,  as it enters \ninto purchase orders or contracts involving amounts over $1 million with any supplier that \nhas been identified as an affiliate, Minnesota Power will disclose such contracts within 30 \ndays of execution along with a certification that the contr act was entered into at arms -\nlength.183 \nThese steps should resolve any realistic concerns about the possibility of self -\ndealing with regard to material contracts. By taking these steps, the Company’s \ncompliance will not only  be consistent with the Commission’s longstanding and pragmatic \napproach to affiliated interests , but it will  go above and beyond those standards while \nmaintaining the same pragmatism.  \n \n179 Ex. MP -15 at 12 -13, 15 -17 (Anderson Direct).  \n180 Ex. MP -15 at 13 (Anderson Direct). The specific GIP and CPP Investments  entities are listed on page \n14 of Exhibit MP -15. \n181 Ex. MP -35 at 18 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n182 Ex. MP -35 at 18 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n183 Ex. MP -35 at 18 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n \n43 \n 2. Affiliate Interest Concerns  are Properly Addressed  \nDepartment Witness Vavro  expressed concern that the Acquisition will cause \nMinnesota Power to have “hundreds, if not thousands, of new affiliates ,” accusing the \nPartners and Minnesota Power of “unwillingness to support the Commission’s due \ndiligence efforts to protect ratepayer [sic] from associate [sic] harm, as set forth in Minn. \nStat. § 216B.48 . . . . ”184 There are at least three reasons why these arguments are \nmisplaced.  \nFirst, Witness Vavro ignored the practical utility of the heightened affiliated interest \ndisclosures  to which the Company and the Partners have committed. Indeed, Witness \nVavro ’s testimony  contains no mention of  the Company’s existing procurement \nprotocols.185 As a practical matter, the new process that the Company proposed (using \nquestionnaires to identify counterparties more than five percent owned by GIP, CPP  \nInvestments , or BlackRock, plus separate disclosures of each contract above $1 million \nwith those counterparties) should capture all of the agreements and relationships that \ncould be of concern.  \nIn addition, Witness Vavro ignores the Company’s commitment to affiliated interest \nreporting as to GIP and CPP  Investments . Again, the Company committed that in its \nAnnual Affiliate Report, it would (a) identify all entities directly up the chain of ALLETE \ncorporate ownership, from Alloy Parent up to and including CPP Investments  and GIP \nand (b) continue to identify affiliation with BlackRock in the same way it is currently \nreported .186 \n \n184 Ex. DOC -301 at 3, 31 (Vavro Direct).  \n185 Ex. MP -35 at 16 (Anderson Rebuttal).  \n186 Ex. MP -35 at 20 (Anderson Rebuttal ).  \n \n44 \n Witness Vavro also fails to consider that the corporate structure that will result from \nthe Acquisition – with both GIP and CPP Investments  having large ownership stakes – \nprovides the Partners with a unique set of incentives to minimize the risks of self -dealing \nor preferential contracts. GIP has a strong incentive to make sure that its  large investment \nin ALLETE is not impaired due to some improper contract or relationship between an \nALLETE entity and a CPP Investments entity, and CPP Investments has a strong \nincentive to make sure that its investment in ALLETE is not impaired due to some \nimproper contract or relationship between an ALLETE entity and a GIP entity.  \nMost importantly, Witness Vavro’s proposed approach would be a big change from \nthe way the affiliated interest statute is currently implemented. As noted in the \nCommission Staff’s briefing  papers, the Department’s interpretation of the requirements \nwould “result in an increase  in the number of contracts requiring Commission approval \nbeyond Staff’s – and the  Department’s – current capacity to process in a timely \nmanner. ”187 For years, companies like BlackRock and Vanguard have owned more than \nfive percent of the shares of various Minnesota utilities, but there has been no sign that \nthose relationships have created any concerns about self -dealing or related issues. \nWitness Va vro has not presented any compelling explanation for why a change is \nnecessary.  \nCURE Witness Baker , of the self -identified “watchdog ” Private Equity Stakeholder \nProject ,188 argues that BlackRock’s acquisition of GIP creates a conflict of interest given \n \n187 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners , Docket No. PA -24-198, STAFF BRIEFING PAPERS  at 21 \n(Sept. 11, 2024).  \n188 Private Equity Stakeholder Project : Our Mi ssion and Values, available online at \nhttps://pestakeholder.org/about -us/our -mission -and-values/   \n \n45 \n BlackRock’s ownership stakes in various ALLETE customers, suppliers, and \ncompetitors.189 Witness Baker’s argument is unfounded – if BlackRock’s influence were \npernicious, it would already be a problem. As mentioned above, BlackRock currently \nowns (as of April 2024) about 13.36 percent of ALLETE’s shares. It also owns material \npercentages of other companies that ALLETE does business with, such as Cleveland \nCliffs (10.99 percent as of June 20, 2024) and United States Steel (10.41 percent). But \nthere is  neither  evidence of , nor reason to suspect , preferential treatment as between \nALLETE and these companies. To the contrary,  the vast majority of BlackRock’s business \nis providing investment options for investors who trust it with their money .  And specifically \nwith respect to ALLETE,  Cleveland Cliffs and U.S. Steel have demonstrated (including \nthrough their involvement with LPI, advocating in this proceeding against the Acquisition) \nthat they are hard negotiators against Minnesota Power . Moreover, it is common for \ndiversified inves tors to have holdings in  multiple businesses that may or may not do \nbusiness with each other  – this is not a conflict of interest. The notion that BlackRock will \nsomehow exert undue influence over the Company has no basis in the record or in \ncommon sense.  \nUltimately, the commitments made by the Company and the Partners regarding \naffiliated interests and related reporting provide strong protection against the risk of self -\ndealing or preferential treatment. Attempt s to expand the application of the affiliated \ninterest statute to this Company – and, in turn, all public utilities – should be rejected.  \n \n189 Ex. CURE -600 at 2 -3, 27 -34 (Baker Direct).  \n \n46 \n F. Governance  \nThe Acquisition provides continuity in the function of the ALLETE Board . Today, \nthe ALLETE Board provides “oversight focused on ensuring that the Company is \nmanaged in a manner that builds long -term value for [the Company’s] shareholders, \ncustomers, employees, and communities. ”190 The ALLETE Board reviews Minnesota \nPower’s “strategy, operational performance, budget, and forecast ” and approves “major \nregulatory filings and project decisions. ”191 The ALLETE Board is elected annually by the \nshareholders with a goal of diverse backgrounds and perspectives to provide direction to \nthe Company on strategic matters.192 There will be no changes as to how Minnesota \nPower develops its strategy and presents that information to the ALLETE Board as a \nresult of the Acquisition.193 As summarized by Witness Scissons:  \nCurrently, talented professionals at Minnesota Power develop strategic \nplans and submit them to the Board for approval. Following the [Acquisition] , \nstrategic plans will still be developed by professionals at Minnesota Power \nand submitted to the [ALLETE] Board for approval, and the strategic \nplanning is expected to be developed by the same teams and individuals \nbecause of commitments by the Partners to the continuity of Minnesota \nPower’s workforce. Additionally, as further detailed in the Direct Testimony \nof Company Witness Cady, the Partners are supportive of Minnesota \nPower’s collaborative approach to stakeholder engagement going \nforward.194 \nThus, the Acquisition will not change the way in which Minnesota Power and the ALLETE \nBoard interact regarding Minnesota Power’s strategic direction.   \n \n190 Ex. MP -10 at 9 (Scissons Direct). Minnesota Power and ALLETE’s Board are the same and the ALLETE \nBoard discusses both utility and non -utility business. Ex. MP -10 at 9 (Scissons Direct).  \n191 Ex.

MP -10 at 12 (Scissons Direct).  \n \n47 \n Many parties raised concerns  related to the control of the Board.195 These \nconcerns attempt to confuse the record and what is actually being proposed with the \nAcquisition. To be clear,  the ALLETE Board will be established based on decisions by the \nALLETE shareholders – the Partners.196 And while the new shareholders will be different, \nthe fact that the board is approved by shareholders is not. The ALLETE Board will be \ncomprised of four directors appointed by CPP Investments, six directors appointed by \nGIP (two on behalf of CalPERS) ,197 and three independent directors.198 The Partners \nhave committed that at least one director must be from Minnesota and another from \nWisconsin – this type of guaranteed local perspective for the ALLETE Board is not present \nwithout the Acquisition.199 Finally, the Chief Executive Officer of ALLETE will be a voting \nmember, and will not count as the director from either Minnesota or Wisconsin.200 There \nare several reasons why this is a reasonable, appropriate, and sufficient composition of \nthe post -Acquisition ALLETE Board.   \nFirst, as the Board will be comprised of a total of thirteen directors, seven votes \nare necessary for a majority and no one Partner may appoint a majority of the board.201 \nAs such, no one Partner will have control of the post -Acquisition ALLETE Board.

If they fail to do so, the directors will \nbe in violation of the law.  \nFinally, the record evidence does not support that any of the concerns and \npotential outcomes raised by other Party witnesses are likely to occur.

Lastly,  it \nis critical to remember that even if certain decisions are made by the ALLETE Board, \nMinnesota Power, its capital structure, its rates, its resource planning, its transmission \nand distribution planning, and its affiliated interests will all remain subjec t to the review, \noversight, and approval of the Commission after the Acquisition.  Therefore, the \ngovernance approach underscores that  the Acquisition is consistent with the public \ninterest.  \nG. Ratemaking and Affordability  \nThe Acquisition supports and enhances the Company’s commitment to fair \nratemaking practices and customer affordability. While parties speculated about  potential \nnegative impacts on customer rates and the economic well -being of customers  based \nlargely on generalized fears about private equity or scenario “runs,” the full authority of \nthe Commission as well as the substantial  additional commitments by the Partners  fully \nsafeguard customers from any concerns about cost or rate implications related to the \nAcquisition.  Rather, t he record evidence demonstrates that there will be improvement to \nthe overall well-being of Minnesota Power’s customers if the Acquisition closes , and that \nlimiting the Company’s access to capital would only constrain the financial health of the \nCompany without real benefit to customers.  Most significantly, the Commission will retain \nfull authority over the rates the Company sets in its future rate cases , rider proceedings, \nand other cost recovery matters.  \n \n210 Ex. MP -27 at Schedule 1 (Cady Rebuttal).  \n \n52 \n First, the Partners and Minnesota Power have made fundamental commitments  to \nprotect customers against costs attributable to the Acquisition itself . Specifically, \nMinnesota Power and the Partners committed not to seek rate recovery from Minnesota \nPower’s customers for any Acquisition -related costs.211 Moreover, the Partners explicitly \naffirmed that transition costs associated with the Acquisition would not be recovered from \ncustomers unless such costs are demonstrably offset by corresponding customer \nsavings.212 Witness Anderson provided testimony detailing how these costs are being and \nwill be tracked to ensure they are not charged to customers.213 Witness Cady further \nunderscored this careful tracking at the evidentiary hearing.214 \nSecond, access to capital and investment in needed infrastructure do not translate \ndirectly to higher rates in all respects, and certainly not to rates that are not just and \nreasonable. The Commission approves the utility’s major projects in multiple steps – \nthrou gh resource plans, certificate of need and permitting proceedings, and various cost \nrecovery proceedings. Regardless of the investment, it cannot be included in rates unless \nthe Commission approves a request of the utility.  \nAdditionally, the Company does not ask for all of its investments to be included in \nrates. As noted by Witness Cady, many of the Company’s planned investments are not \ndirectly rate recovered in rates but rather are shared ( “cost-allocated ”) between different \nentities, typically based on their load (usage) within Midcontinent Independent System \nOperator ( “MISO ”). This is true of four MISO Long -Range Transmission Planning \n(“LRTP ”) projects that form a large portion of Minnesota Power’s capital needs, includin g: \n \n211 Ex.

Indeed, no witness points to any new investment, cost, \nor cost increase that is driven by the Acquisition or the Partners. If anything, they raise \n \n215 Ex.

Witness Walters \nspecifically argued  that private equity ownership might  lead to increased customer rates \ndue to heightened equity returns sought by private investors and planned capital \nexpenditures by the Company.221Witness Walters argued these factors could \ncompromise affordability, especially impacting industrial and residential customers alike \ndue to higher financing costs and potential increases in cost of service under private \nownership.222 OAG Witness Lebens also raised similar concerns  and arguments \nregarding customer rates .223 \nHowever, as noted by Company Witness Cady:  \nFor [this] potential harm to come to fruition, the Commission would have to \nfully abdicate its duties in setting just and reasonable rates for customers \nby approving proposals that were directly opposed to the public interest, \nboth in terms of approving sp ecific projects and investments and also in \napproving cost recovery proposals. It is Minnesota Power’s position that the \nCommission will execute its duties as outlined in Minnesota state law to set \njust and reasonable rates as it always has. Witness Walter s seems to \nacknowledge that the utility cannot unilaterally charge customers however \nit wants when writing, “[o]ne critical aspect of Commission decisions over \nthe next 5 -10 years will be controlling the pace and magnitude of \ninvestment, to control the pace and amount of future rate increases. ”224 \n \nAdditionally, these concerns are diminished even more when looking at several \nrecent electric utilities that have transitioned from being publicly traded to privately owned . \n \n220 Ex.

Several examples were  offered  into the record225 and \nare listed  below, including El Paso Electric (both Texas and New Mexico utilities), CLECO \nPower, Duquesne Light Company and Puget Sound Energy. When looking at the five \ninvestor owned electric utilities below that have been acquired since 2007, their collective \nComp ound Annual Growth Rate ( “CAGR ”) averaged 1.62 percent per year from the year \nof acquisition, which is not only well below the rate of inflation but also lower than their \nrespective statewide averages and national investor owned utility averages over the s ame \ntime period, as shown in Table 1.  \n[next page]  \n \n225 Ex. MP -27 at 14 -15 (Cady Rebuttal).  \n \n56 \n Table 1. Energy Information Administration Retail Rates226 \n \nEven so, the Company and the Partners developed additional commitments to \nfurther support customer affordability . Specifically,  the Partners committed to maintain \nMinnesota Power’s Customer Affordability of Residential Electricity ( “CARE ”) program at \nexisting funding levels, with no reduction in eligibility criteria  (e.g., L IHEAP227 eligibility not \nrequired, which is particularly valuable to customers after the recent firing of the entire \n \n226 Ex.

With these protections in place , the Company \naffirmed it will bear the burden of proof in future rate cases, assuring the Commission and \n \n235 As discussed by Company and Partner Witness Quackenbush, a ten basis  point increase in the cost of \nequity as it relates to the Company’s 2023 rate case outcome translates to $1.8 million of Minnesota Power \nrevenue requirement increase.

Rather than \nposing potential risks, the Company’s and the Partners’ detailed commitments will \naffirmatively protect customers against inappropriate cost increases, enhance \ntransparency, and directly support ongoing rate affordability consistent with Minnesota’s \nregulatory and public policy objectives.  \nH. Workforce and Labor Protections  \nIn Order Point 3(F) of the Commission’s Order, the Commission directed the \nparties to develop the record on impacts to and protections for Minnesota Power’s \nbargaining and non -bargaining workforce. The Partners and Minnesota Power have \nestablished commitme nts that provide security to Minnesota Power’s workforce that \nwould not be available absent the transaction. The  two-year post -Acquisition commitment \nto retain the Company’s  current workforce, including bargaining and non -bargaining \nemployees and compensat ion packages, is a clear benefit resulting from the proposed \nAcquisition. Minnesota Power not only anticipate s no negative impacts to Minnesota \nPower’s workforce as a result of this Acquisition ,239 but has made commitments that are \nnot available absent the Acquisition, with the capital available through the Acquisition a \nkey benefit to the Company’s ability to sustain and support its workforce.  The parties to \nthis proceeding who represent the Company’s workforce , such as L IUNA , International \nUnion  of Operating Engineers Local 49  and North Central States Regional Council of \n \n238 Ex. MP -33 at 59 (Bram Rebuttal).  \n239 Ex. MP -17 at 3 (Krollman Direct).  \n \n60 \n Carpenters ( collectively, “IUOE ”), and  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \n(“IBEW ”) Local 31, have each stated that the Acquisition presents minimal risks to its \nmembers who receive employment from the Company , and many potential benefits, and \neach supports the Acquisition .240 \nAs part of the Merger Agreement , the Company memorialized its commitment to \nprotecting its workforce in the Initial Petition, stating “[F]or the two -year period following \nthe Acquisition, each ALLETE nonunion employee . . . will retain extensive protections, \nincluding the same or better employment position in the same location, and wages, \nincentive, benefits, and employee protections no less favorable than those available to \nthe employee immediately prior to the Acquisition. ”241 In addition, the Company  will \ncontinue to honor its contracts with its bargaining employees .242 Absent the Acquisition, \nthe Company’s bargaining and non -bargaining employees would not have had the same, \nor even similar, employee protections as are offered if the Acquisition is approved . \nMinnesota Power  is committed to providing its workforce with certainty and clarity during \nthe Acquisition process and this two -year post -Acquisition commitment benefits the \nCompany’s workforce by doing just that.243 This commitment ensures job security and \nprovides a known and clear benefit following the Acquisition, regardless of external \nfactors, to Minnesota Power’s entire current workforce.  \nIn response to the Company’s workforce commitment, Witness Vavro suggested \nthat Minnesota Power’s commitment to maintain its current workforce, including \n \n240 Ex. LIUNA -801 at 7 (Bryant Direct); Evid. Hrg. Tr. at 71:10 -71:11  (April 1, 2025 ) (Sutton);  and Ex. IBEW -\n801 at 2 (Keyes Direct).  \n241 Ex. MP -17 at 3 -4 (Krollman Direct).  \n242 Ex.

MP -17 at 5 (Krollman Direct).  \n \n61 \n compensation, benefits, and protections, for two years is not a benefit but rather a short -\nterm protection against future harm.244 However, no such commitment exists outside of \nthe Acquisition.  In addition, absent this Acquisition, there is no guarantee that Minnesota \nPower would be able to access the capital it needs for clean energy transition \ninvestments, which could have an impact on its workforce needs. Thus, making this \ncommitment is a benefit over what Minnesota Power employees would have absent the \nAcquisition.  \nFurther, the Company and the Partners have added to that two -year post -\nAcquisition term with commitments to maintain the Company’s current senior \nmanagement team, provide non -bargaining employees with the same or better position \nand compensation and benefits for two -years post -Acquisition, and to maintain the \nCompany’s long -standing relationships with contractors and bargaining employees.245 \nThis commitment is not a short -term protection against future harm ; it offers reassurances \nto all of the Company’s existing employees at every level that their job and employee \nbenefits are protected and supported by the Acquisition and the Partners.  \nIn addition, it is important to underscore that the post -Acquisition commitment not \nonly offers workforce protections during the Acquisition process, but also offers protection \nagainst external factors that may have impacted the Company’s ability to retain its \nworkforce absent the Acquisition.246 Such extensions of benefits and guarantees are not \nfeasible at times when the Company faces significant reductions in revenue or high risk \nfrom its largest customers; however, as a result of the Acquisition this commitment is not \n \n244 Ex.

Underfunding can lead to painful \nconsequences for employees and customers.248 As a result, the Company’s workforce is \naffirmatively and positively benefited by both the certain capital afforded by the Acquisition \nand the specific employee benefits included in the Company’s and the Partners’ \ncommitments.  \nDespite these commitments from the Partners and the Company, Department \nWitness Vavro assumed , without evidence,  that significant changes will occur to \nMinnesota Power’s workforce at the end of the two -year commitment.249 Witness Lane \nalso stressed that the Partners did not provide a commitment to not pressure senior \nmanagement to voluntarily depart during the two -year post -Acquisition commitment.250 In \ndoing so, Witness Lane disregarded statements from Partner Witness Alley that “the day -\nto-day operations of Minnesota Power will continue to be handled by Minnesota Power \nsenior’s management team, with significant decisions continuing to be subject to approval \nby the ALLETE board.”251 This plan is discussed throughout the Petition, pre -filed \ntestimony, and the discovery in the record in this proceeding.

After filing the Initial Petition , the Company \ncommitted to extending  its contract with the IBEW Local 31 through April 30, 2028 , to \nensure benefits accrue directly to its bargaining employees after the Acquisition.252 The \ncontract extension with IBEW Local 31 , which has been ratified by its members,  not only \ndemonstrates the Company’s and the Partners ’ desire s to maintain existing relationships \nwith bargaining employees, but the extension  also addresses IBEW Local 31’s  concerns \nabout the Acquisition and is an improvement from the existing contract.253 Additionally, in \nDirect Testimony IBEW Local 31 expressed concern that new generation facilities \noperated by Minnesota Power post -Acquisition would not be staffed by members of the \nIBEW Local 31 .254 The subsequent contract extension addresses such concerns , \nincluding through the Company’s first -ever neutrality agreement . In addition, this contract \nextension provides additional benefits, salary increases, and job security to existing union \nemployees through April 30, 2028.255 As a result, IBEW Local 31 anticipates impacts on \nits members stemming from the Acquisition to be minimal  or positive256 and is supportive \nof the Acquisition in the regulatory process because the Company has demonstrated its \ncommitment to protecting its workforce post -Acquisition.257  \n \n252 Ex.

LIUNA -802 at 2 (Keyes Surrebuttal).  \n \n64 \n The two -year post -Acquisition commitment has also been received positively from \nlocal bargaining groups such as L IUNA and the IUOE. L IUNA expects the Acquisition to \ndeliver net benefits to its members for two reasons: First, L IUNA reaffirms that \nMinnesota’s strong system and culture of utility regulation protects its labor members \nbecause the Partners will be unbale to raise prices or scale back services without the \nCommission approval. Secondly, L IUNA expressed that the Partners have proven to be \na highly responsible manager of infrastructure investments and have given L IUNA \nconfidence in the credibility of the commitments made to regulators and stakeholders.258 \nSimilarly, IUOE has recognized the Company’s longstanding commitment to employing \nbargaining employees and the benefit Minnesota Power has brought to IUOE members \nacross northeastern Minnesota.259 IOUE has explicitly stated its appreciation for the \nCompany’s commitment to continue contracting with local bargaining groups post -\nAcquisition and continuing to deploy bargaining employees wherever reasonably \npossible.260   \nLastly, t he Partners and the Company have also committed to keeping Minnesota \nPower’s headquarters in Duluth, Minnesota for as long as the Partners own Minnesota \nPower.261 This commitment ensures that Minnesota Power will continue to recruit and \nretain a talented workforce in Minnesota and continue to contribute to Minnesota’s and \nDuluth’s local economy. While some parties have expressed concern that this is “only \n \n258 Ex.

They provide  certainty \nand clarity to the Company’s workforce that regardless of economic changes, market \ndownturns, or other types of external factors, the Company’s current workforce will have \njob security for two years following the Acquisition. The Company will ma intain its current \nsenio r management team ; non-bargaining employees will maintain the same or better \nposition, compensation, and benefits ; and all bargaining and non -bargaining employees \nwill have job security for two -years post -Acquisition because of the Acquisition. The \nCompany’s commitment to its current workforce is a clear benefit to its employees and is \nnot subject to any external factor except for regulatory approval of the Acquisition.  \nUltimately, the Commission knows this Company well, and understands that it is  \ncommitted to supporting, retaining, and empowering its workforce. Similarly, the Partners \nhave every incentive – and have consistently voiced this incentive – to maintain the \nworkforce that is enabling the transition of Minnesota Power’s generation fleet, serving \ncusto mers, supporting the resilience of the transmission and distribution systems, and \notherwise creating value for all Company stakeholders.  The workforce commitments \noffered by  the Partners and the Company provide certainty and clarity to its workforce \nduring a time of great industry transition.   \n \n66 \n I. Core Values and Environmental Commitments  \nAs demonstrated by much of the prior discussion, as well as the additional \ncommitments addressed in this section of this Initial Brief, t he Acquisition aligns with and \nenhances the Company's longstanding core values and steadfast environmental \ncommitments . Contrary to speculative concerns raised in this proceeding  about what \nmight happen , the record demonstrates that explicit commitments are in place to maintain \nthe Company's name and identity, location, community engagement, local accountability, \nand economic development practices.   \nCURE Witness Baker expressed apprehension that private equity ownership might \nprioritize short -term financial interests over preserving local economic initiatives, \nemployee relations, and established corporate values central to the Company’s \nidentity.262 Similarly, Sierra  Club Witness Lane raised concerns about potential risks to \nthe Company's environmental objectives, particularly regarding its ability to meet \nMinnesota’s ambitious CFS and planned retirement of coal generation facilities.263 \nWitness Lane argued  that changes in ownership could negatively impact the pace or \neffectiveness of the Company’s renewable energy transition.264 \nHowever, none of these witnesses identified any actual experience with these \nPartners, and largely based their concerns on possibility or scenario planning. In contrast, \nthe Company  selected these Partners precisely because of their alignment with the \nCompany’s deep -seated principles of local engagement, employee well -being, and \nenvironmental leadership .265 Contrary to claim s that private equity’s high -return targets \n \n262 Ex.

First, the Partners \nexplicitly committed to maintaining historical levels of economic development activities \nwithin Minnesota for as long as they own the Company.268 This affirmation ensure s the \ncontinuation of the Company’s established practice of supporting local economies, \ncommunities, and associated economic investments.  \nAdditionally, the Partners made clear that the Company’s headquarters will remain \nlocated in Duluth, Minnesota.269 They further committed to retaining existing local \nmanagement structures and operational leadership, explicitly supporting continued local \ngovernance and community -focused decision -making.270 The Partners  also affirmed a \ncommitment to defer to the existing management and operational culture of the \n \n266 Ex.

In \ncontrast to other parties ’ “potential ” concerns in these areas, the Partners have offered \ncommitments to maintain these key cultural components of Minnesota Power.  \nConcerning transparency in corporate practices, the Partners confirmed that the \nCompany will continue to voluntarily publish  its Corporate Sustainability Report.272 This \nreport historically documents environmental stewardship, diversity, equity, and inclusion \npractices, and other ESG -related activities. By continuing this voluntary reporting, the \nPartners explicitly signaled ongoing support for the Company’s longstan ding core values \nand corporate responsibility initiatives.  \nRegarding environmental concerns, Witness Lane cautioned against potential \nrisks to Minnesota Power’s compliance with Minnesota’s CFS.273 Without evidence of \nsuch, Witness Lane expressed doubt that the Company, under private ownership, could \nadequately maintain its current trajectory toward carbon -free operations and renewable \nenergy expansion.274 In contrast , the Partners explicitly affirmed their commitment to \nsupporting Minnesota Power meeting Minnesota’s CFS through pathways ultimately \ndetermined by the Commission’s Integrated Resource Planning process.275 This \ncommitment is discussed more in Section VII below.  \nThe Partners also articulated explicit commitments to significant investment in \nrenewable energy infrastructure, clearly recognizing the importance  and value  of \n \n271 Ex.

The \nPartners’ stated commitments  also emphasized adherence to regulatory determinations, \nincluding resource planning decisions made through the Commission’s established \nregulatory framework, directly aligning the Company’s future operational strategy with \nMinnesota’s environmental mandates.277 \nBeyond explicit commitments, the Partners have demonstrated their integrity and \nintentions throughout their work with Minnesota Power to date.  As discussed by Witness \nCady:  \n[P]rivate equity ownership by the Partners provides more certainty on the \nalignment of values than public market ownership as the Partners have \nprovided sworn testimony that they are, in fact, supportive of Minnesota \nPower’s values and leadership team. Min nesota Power’s leadership team \nwitnessed the Partners demonstrate these values since signing the Merger \nAgreement in 2024, by spending time with Company employees, customers \nand, community leaders across our service territory and being willing to \nengage co llaboratively with all interested parties to address concerns \nrelated the Acquisition.278 \n \nOverall, the role of the Partners and their extensive commitments , in collaboration \nwith Minnesota Power, provide substantial assurances concerning the Company’s \ncontinued adherence to core corporate values, local governance, employee relationships, \nand ambitious environmental commitments. These commitments reinforce the Partners’  \nalignment with Minnesota  Power ’s regulatory objectives and Minnesota’s public policy \ngoals, addressing and substantially mitigating concerns raised  in this proceeding.   \n \n276 Ex.

THE ACQUISITION HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE OTHER STATE AND \nFEDERAL AGENCIES .279  \nOrder Point 3(E) of the Commission's Order requested an explanation of how any \n“relevant and related dockets pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and/or other state, federal or \nforeign government agencies impact the Commission’s consideration  of the \n[Acquisition ]?”280 The Acquisition  has undergone review in several forums, including the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission ( “FERC ”) and the Public Service Commission of \nWisconsin ( “PSCW ”).281 The Company  also submitted the Hart -Scott -Rodino ( “HSR ”) \npremerger notification to the Federal Trade Commission and Antitrust Division of the \nJustice Department . Further,  on August 21, 2024, ALLETE’s shareholders voted to \napprove the proposed Acquisition  with a pproximately 97 percent of shareholder s voting \nin favor of approving the transaction.282 Each of these approvals, particularly those \ngranted by agencies of the federal government and the PSCW, are only possible because \nthis Acquisition is consistent with the public interest. The Company anticipates that the \nCommission’s approval will be the last step before the Acquisition may close.   \n1. FERC Approval  \nThe FERC reviewed this transaction under §§ 203(a)(1) and 203(a)( 2) of the \nFederal Power Act (“FPA”) to determine whether it is consistent with the public interest.283 \n \n279 Issue E, set forth in the Order at 12.    \n280 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canda Pension Plan \nInvestment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners , Docket No. E015/PA -24-198, ORDER REQUIRING \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND GRANTING INTERVENTION , AND NOTICE OF AND ORDER FOR HEARING  (Oct. 7, \n2024); Ex.

The Order states, “As discussed below, we authorize the \nProposed Transaction as consistent with the public interest. ”284 While the FERC defers \nto the state commissions with respect to additional regulation, n o further approvals are  \nrequired by the  FERC . \n2. Public Service Commission of Wisconsin  \nThe PSCW proceeding , in Docket No. 5820 -DR-100, examined whether the \nWisconsin Utility Holding Company Act  (“WUHCA ”) applied and, if so, how it should guide \nthe Acquisition’s approval .285 On January 23, 2025, all parties to the PSCW’s proceeding \non this matter agreed to waive their respective rights to a contested case hearing and \nexecuted a Stipulation of Facts and Waiver of Hearing ( “Stipulation ”). The Stipulation was \nagreed to by all parties, including the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, IBEW Local 31, \nMadison Gas and Electric Company, Wisconsin Electric Power Company, and the \nWisconsin Public Service Corporation.286 On March  13, 2025, the PSCW orally approved \nthe transaction, subject to certain conditions, thereby removing any Wisconsin -specific \nbarriers .287 All necessary state -level approvals in Wisconsin are thus complete.  No party \nto this proceeding has raised issues with respect to the Wisconsin approval.  \n3. Hart -Scott -Rodino Clearance  \nThe Company was required  to file notifications with the federal antitrust agencies \nunder the HSR Act .288 This submission was made on January 31, 2025, prompting a \n \n284 ALLETE, Inc. & Alloy Parent LLC, EC24 -105-000, FERC ¶ 2 (2024), available online at \nhttps://www.ferc.gov/media/e -14-ec24 -105-000 (last accessed April 10, 2025); Ex.

MINNESOTA POWER’S UNION AND NON -UNION WORKFORCE S ACTIVELY \nSUPPORT THE ACQUISITION  AND ARE BENEFITTED BY IT.290 \nConsistent with the protections for employees discussed in the Petition initiating \nthis proceeding  and the discussion in Section IV.H of this Initial Brief, the Company \nanticipates that Minnesota Power’s workforces will benefit from the Acquisition. T he \nrecord unequivocally demonstrate s that there are real and measurable benefits to the \nMinnesota Power workforce that will occur if the Acquisition is approved. These benefits \nto employees are not ensured if the Acquisition is denied. Any potential harms are purely \nspeculative. The benefits  of the Acquisition for Minnesota Power’s workforce are \ndiscussed in detail in Section VI.H, above.  \nVII. A KEY PURPOSE OF THE ACQUISITION IS TO ENSURE MINNESOTA POWER \nHAS THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH THE CARBON -FREE \nSTANDARD .291 \nOrder Point 3(G) of the Order directs the record to be developed on “How will the \nacquisition impact Minnesota Power's ability to comply with the carbon -free standard \nunder § 216B.1691, including any modifications of plans associated with the Nemadji Trail \nEnergy Center? ” As discussed throughout this proceeding, t he primary goal of the \nAcquisition is to provide the Company with a reliable stream of significant additional equity \n \n289 Ex. MP -40 at 2 (Cady Surrebuttal).  \n290 Issue F, set forth in the Order at 12.  \n291 Issue G, set forth in the Order at 12.  \n \n73 \n capital that will allow the Company to expand its investments in clean energy technologies \nto comply with the C FS.292 Minnesota Power is aware that company operations alone \nwould be insufficient to produce the necessary cash flow to fund the capital investments \nto comply with the CFS.293 The Company’s five -year plan demonstrates a significant need \nfor additional capital, in the form of an approximately 3.8 -times increase in regulated \ninvestments compared to the Company’s historical ten -year average.294 The Acquisition \nbest positions the Company to achieve its goals and comply with the CFS because it \nprovides the Company with a committed and reliable stream of equity capital to invest in \nclean energy technologies while maintaining safe, reliable, and affordable service to \nMinnesota Power customers.   \nConsideration of the benefits of the Acquisition to enable meeting the CFS also \nrequires consideration of the risks of not meeting the CFS without the Partners’ support.  \nAbsent the Acquisition, it is unclear whether  the Company would be able to access the \ncapital it needs to invest in clean energy technologies , particularly given the cyclicality of \nthe public markets, public stockholders’ demands for regular quarterly dividends \nregardless of conditions facing the Company and its revenue streams, and the pri ce the \nCompany can obtain on public stock issuances if it needs to issue large quantities on a \nregular basis.295 Without the Acquisition, compliance with the CFS may not be possible \nfor Minnesota Power.   \nNo party raised issues in this proceeding regarding the potential impacts of the \nAcquisition on Nemadji Trail Energy Center . Rather, a s discussed by Company witness \n \n292 Ex. MP -9 at 7 (Cady Direct).  \n293 Ex. MP -11 at 6 (Taran Direct).  \n294 Ex. MP -11 at 5 (Taran Direct).  \n295 Ex.

However, both the Partners \nand Minnesota Power have  commit ted to efforts to achieve the CFS and affirm to be part \nof the regulatory process in Minnesota and the jurisdiction of the Commission.303 The \nrecord further demonstrates that the  Company’s Board of Directors chose the Partners \nbecause of their character and value alignment with existing Company goals, which is \ninclusive of compliance with the CFS.304 The Partners and the Company have further \nprovided explicit affirmation to the Commission’s determinations regarding resource \nplanning, distribution planning, resource acquisition decisions, and efforts to achieve \nMinnesota’s CFS.305  \nLastly, Department Witness Addonizio further expressed that it is possible the \nPartners sell Alloy Parent  and ALLETE prior to 2040, and that the new owner or owners \nwill play an important role in compliance with the CFS.306 Sierra Club Witness Lane \nreiterated this concern , citing no commitment from the Partners to maintain its ownership \n \n301 Ex.

DOC -303 at 76 -77 (Addonizio Direct).  \n76 of Minnesota Power for any specific period of time.307 However, this speculation overlooks \nthat the Partners’ business model is not oriented toward short -term asset flipping, but \nrather towards long -term, infrastructure based investments that are required for the \nCompany to comply with the CFS.308 It also ignores that the question with respect to the \nCFS is not a binary proposition of whether or not either or both Partners will each maintain \n100 percent of their interests in ALLETE through 2040; rather, it is whether their \ninvestment in ALLETE is consistent with or beneficial to, not detrimental to, the \nCompany’s ability to achieve Minnesota ’s carbon free policy requirements and goals. \nGiven  that the major investments at ALLETE need to occur in the next five to 10 years,309 \nparticularly with the Boswell units currently set to retire by 2035,310 the Partners’ capital \nis critical to efforts to achieve the CFS and transition Minnesota Power.311 Further, \nWitnesses Addonizio and Lane given little credence to the Commission’s own role, as \nany future sale of a meaningful interest in ALLETE will be subject to the oversight and \nconditions of this Commission. As such, their arguments about a potential sale prior to \n2040 are not in the nature of either benefits or harms; they are simply speculation about \npossible future events.  \n307 Ex.

The Acquisition puts the Company in the best position to achieve the CFS and \nprovide the Company with the necessary capital to invest in clean energy technologies \nwhile maintaining safe, reliable, and affordable service to its customers.314 The Company \ncontinues to affirm that it will be bound by the obligations set under Minnesota Statute \nand directed by Commission order, including such orders that direct the Company’s \nintegrated resource plans and resource acquisitions.315 The record also demonstrates the \nPartner’s commitment to provide funding for the Company’s five -year plan, which includes \nefforts necessary to comply with the CFS.316 Overall, the Partners and the Company are \ncommitted to efforts to achieve the CFS and have reflected that commitment throughout \nthe Acquisition proceeding.   \nVIII. THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC \nINTEREST , PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE COMMITMENTS IN THE RECORD .317 \nAs shown above, the record establishes that the Acquisition is consistent with the \npublic interest and should be approved, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 216B.50. Minnesota \n \n312 Evid. Hr. Tr. at 251:15 -21 (April 1, 2025) (Scissons).  \n313 Ex. MP -9 at 19 (Cady Direct).  \n314 Ex. MP -11 at 5 (Taran Direct); Ex.

MP -27 at 26 (Cady Rebuttal).  \n317 Issues C and D, set forth in the Order at 12.  \n \n78 \n Power and the Partners have presented numerous benefits of the Acquisition, reinforced \nby specific, concrete commitments.  The other parties to this proceeding have not \nidentified any additional conditions that are necessary  for the Acquisition to be consistent \nwith the public interest . In fact, when pressed for actual conditions that the agencies or \nintervenors wanted to address their “potential ” concerns with the Acquisition  (other than \nWitness Vavro’s proposals for an impractical non-consolidation  opinion and unnecessary \nrestructuring of ALLETE itself,  which have undesirable implications as  addressed earlier \nin this Initial Brief) , witnesses affirmatively stated they had not proposed any or could not \narticulate any for the record.318  \nLikewise, t he evidence submitted by Minnesota Power and the Partners in this \ncase shows that the Acquisition will not result in any adverse impacts on customers, \nservice cost or quality, employees, or communities.319 The Partners are also not seeking \nto change Minnesota Power’s operations.320 Further, the Acquisition will not cut \ninvestments or service or fundamentally change cost structures or  long-term plans for  \nMinnesota Power .321 \nNonetheless, to demonstrate their commitment to each other, to the Company’s \nstakeholders and regulatory processes, and to State policy, the Company and the \nPartners developed a significant number of commitments in the form of affirmative \nbenefits to custo mers, protections against perceived concerns, and affirmations of \nongoing practices.322 These are summarized in ATTACHMENT A  to this brief, \n \n318 Evid. Hrg. Tr. at 356:18 -356:22  (April 2, 2025) (Quackenbush),  Evid. Hrg. Tr. at 476:3 -477:20 (April 2, \n2025 ) (Vavro ); Evid. Hrg. Tr. at 793:14 -793:18 (April 3, 2025) (Lebens),  Evid. Hrg.

MP -27 at Schedule 1 (Cady Rebuttal).  \n \n79 \n summarized in the testimony of Witness Cady, which also incorporates commitments \nidentified by Witness Lapson. These  commitments amply address any risks of the \nAcquisition , and in many cases provide additional protections that do not currently exist  \ndespite perceived risks being equally applicable to public shareholders.  \nTo the contrary,  the Acquisition will provide Minnesota Power access to capital \nfrom the Partners that is necessary for Minnesota Power to achieve its clean energy goals \nand comply with Minnesota policy standards, while continuing to provide safe, reliable, \nand affordable  service to customers.323 The Acquisition offers a  unique opportunity for  \nMinnesota Power to  partner with  global leaders in infrastructure deployment who share \nMinnesota Power’s vision and values  and who can provide  reliable, patient, and flexible  \ncapital without  the risks associated with  the public markets .324 This Acquisition will also  \nallow  Minnesota Power’s  investors to be more closely aligned with  employee, customer, \nand stakeholder  needs  as compared to the current large number of  public investors .325 \nTherefore, the Commission should find that the  Acquisition is consistent with the public \ninterest and should be approved . \nIX. CONCLUSION  \nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Company respectfully requests that the \nCommission approve the Acquisition as consistent with the public interest and enter an \nOrder implementing the commitments identified in ATTACHMENT A to this Initial Brief as \nsupporting the approval of the Acquisition.  \n \n323 Ex.

As there  are many applicable laws, rules, orders, policies, and past\ncommitments that govern Minnesota Power’s obligations to its customers, the Commission, and other stakeholder s, this list is not intended to every possible continuing obligation but to illustrate the Company’s\nand the Partners’ overall commitment to the regulatory compact and the authority of the Commission.\nCOMMITMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE ACQUISITION  \nCommitments  Testimony Locations  Benefits of the Commitment to Customers  and Stakeholders  \nFinancial \nCommitments \nto Minnesota \nPower  1.To alleviate concerns about the availability of investment funds, Alloy Parent\ncommits to provide to M innesota Power  equity financing, including but not limited\nto equity infusion, deferral or reinvestment of dividends, or a combination of both,\nin an amount at least equal to the equity financing required to fund Minnesota\nPower’s 5 -year capital investment plan reflecte d in its February 2025 10 -K filing,\nsubject to prospective reasonable and prudent plan adjustments.\nThe Partners are able to make this commitment with the understanding that this \nfunding commitment will not be used to establish a higher or lower ROE. The \nPartners do not intend to suggest that there are any limits on the Commission’s \nauthority to establish an ROE or for parties to advocate  for reasonable returns \nconsistent with legal requirements, but it would be unreasonable to accept a \nfunding commitment and then use the commitment as a basis to reduce the returns.   Scissons Rebuttal  Sec. VI.  \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III. B.  \nBram Rebuttal Sec. II. \nQuackenbush Rebuttal Sec.  B. This commitment ensures that Minnesota Power will have access to the equity it needs. Absent \nthis Acquisition, Minnesota Power, through ALLETE, will need to make serial common equity \nofferings. Since the Company’s stock was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1950 \n(nearly 75 years ago), the Company has raised approximately $1.3 billion through follow -on \ncommon equity offerings. To fund the billions of dollars  necessary for the implementation of \nMinnesota Power’s five -year capital plan, Minnesota Power would need to raise approximately \n$1 billion through follow -on common equity offerings over the next five years. These offerings \nwill be subject to whatever the market will bear at that time, which could be detrimental to \nMinnesota Power’s customers.  \nNo investor in the public market is able to make this kind of commitment.  The Partners’ interest \nin the Company is tied to its current functions as a utility, including its ability to generate stable \nreturns commensurate with other utilities of comparable risk profiles and reasonable growth \nopportunities, thereby contributing in  its own way to broader, diverse holdings of GIP and CPP \nInvestments. Further, the Partners recognize that the success of this investment can only occur if \nMinnesota Power is adequately funded.    \n2.Minnesota Power will provide compliance filing s on equity infusions from  and\ndividends to  Alloy Parent in the same manner that the Company currently provides\ncompliance filings in its capital structure docket.Cady Rebuttal at Sec. VII. \nAnderson Rebuttal Sec. II. C. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. II. Minnesota Power will be ensuring transparency regarding equity and dividends . \nCapital Structure \n(Equity and Debt) 3.ALLETE will not make any dividend or distribution that would cause the actual\nequity ratio of Minnesota Power to be outside the range approved by the\nCommission.Alley Rebuttal Sec. III.A. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. III. \nCady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  Although the Company makes annual capital structure filings and ALLETE is required to \nmanage within that range, ALLETE has no current regulatory limitation on when it may \nmake any dividend or distribution.  This commitment will ensure that no dividends or \ndistributions are issued that could impair ALLETE’s financial viability.  \n4.The Company commits to not make any dividend or distributions unless at least\none senior unsecured credit rating is investment grade or above.Alley Rebuttal Sec. III.A. This commitment protects the Company’s credit rating, and therefore the cost of debt, and limits \nthe Partners’ ability to take distributions.  \n5.If Minnesota Power’s cost of debt increases above current levels within three\nyears following the close of the Acquisition, Minnesota ratepayers will be held\nharmless from any rate impact unless Minnesota Power can demonstrate that\nits increased cost of de bt was not caused by the Acquisition.Taran Rebuttal  Sec. III. D. \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III.F. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. III. This provision protects customers if the cost of debt were to change as a result of the Acquisition . \n6.ALLETE will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its current\ncorporate and facility ratings.Lapson Direct Schedule 3  \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.   This commitment will help ensure reasonable costs of capital for customers, as well as \nstakeholder insight into the Company’s financial health.  \n7.ALLETE will use commercially reasonable efforts to remain rated by at least\ntwo credit rating agencies.Lapson Direct 15:8-14 \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  Currently, Minnesota Power has no regulatory obligation to remain rated by at least two credit \nrating agencies. This commitment will help ensure reasonable costs of capital for customers, as \nwell as stakeholder insight into the Company’s financial health.  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMinnesota Power Initial Brief \nAttachment A \nPage 1 of 11\n \n2 \n COMMITMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE ACQUISITION  \n Commitments  Testimony Locations  Benefits of the Commitment to Customers  and Stakeholders  \nCorporate \nSeparateness/  \nRing Fencing  8. With respect to ALLETE and the parent entities up through the Partners, ALLETE \nwill maintain certain corporate separateness (i.e. “ring fencing”) commitments \nwith respect to the parent and other upstream entitie s, as set forth in Schedule 3 to \nthe Direct Testimony of Ellen Lapson . Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nAnderson Rebuttal Sec. II. B. \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. II. \nLapson Direct Schedule 3  ALLETE, Minnesota Power, and the remainder of the ALLETE family of companies will \nmaintain current ring -fencing , which has been put in place by the Commission over many years  \nfor the protection of customers , and additional ring -fencing measures following the Acquisition . \n9. Alloy Parent will not use utility assets to guarantee Alloy Parent debt.  Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nAnderson Rebuttal Sec. II. B. \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III.F. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. III. Minnesota Power and ALLETE will continue to guarantee debt as it does today , extending ring -\nfencing to the Alloy Parent and protecting utility assets for the benefit of customers.  \n10. Minnesota Power will be prohibited from loaning funds to or borrowing funds from  \nits Alloy parent  or other upstream  entities . Anderson Rebuttal Sec. II. B. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. II  This ring -fencing commitment will ensure that loans are not made between ALLETE and Alloy \nParent or upstream entities, protecting corporate separateness.  \nGovernance  11. In addition to the ALLETE CEO, the ALLETE board will include two independent \nmembers, with one member from Minnesota and one member from Wisconsin, \neach of whom will be a voting member.  Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III.D. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. VI.  Currently, ALLETE’s board of directors is elected by shareholders based on those shareholders’ \ninterests. This commitment provides for several independent members , ensures an independent \nvoice on the Board , and provides for  local representation  as well . \n12. The ALLETE CEO’s board seat will not count as the director from the Stat e of \nMinnesota or State of Wisconsin on the post -acquisition Board of Directors.  Alley Rebuttal Sec. III.D. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. VI.  This commitment further enhances  the geographic diversity commitments in Commitment 11.  \n13. The chief executive officer  (CEO)  of ALLETE will b e a voting  member of the \npost-Acquisition ALLETE board of directors.  Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nBram Rebuttal Sec. VI.  \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III.D  This commitment ensures that the Board includes representation from the senior leadership \nteam and maintains continuity from the current Board . \n14. The Partners commit that the governance of ALLETE will be handled consistent \nwith the following concepts:  \no The day -to-day operations of Minnesota Power will be handled by the \nMinnesota Power senior management team.  \no The members of the ALLETE board will be selected by the Partners based \non their experience in relevant industries.  \no 13 total board members, with each investor having the right to appoint one \ndirector to the board for every 10 percent ownership of ALLETE, Inc. held \nindirectly through Alloy Parent.   \n \nThe purpose of this commitment is to clarify that the ALLETE board has authority to \nmake decisions for the Company, in alignment with the current operation of the \nCompany.   Alley Rebuttal Sec. III.D. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. VI. \nCady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  This commitment ensures that the ALLETE board will continue to have appropriate oversight \nauthorities, and that Company  management will continue to handle  day-to-day operations of \nthe business. A differently structured investor group or owner may not make commitments of \nthis nature.  \nAffiliated \nInterest s 15. Minnesota Power will require all suppliers , and any industrial customers with \ncontracted rates, to identify annually whether they are more than 5% owned by \nCPPIB, GIP, or Blackrock. Minnesota Power will list those entities in the annual \naffiliated interest report.  Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nAnderson Rebuttal Sec. III. B. \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III.E. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. VII. This reporting will augment current requirements to ensure that no self -dealing occurs related \nto the new investors. In addition to historical application of the affiliated interest requirements \nconsistent with other investor owned utilities, these additio nal commitments will protect against \nany risks of self -dealing.  This commitment further underscores the Partners’ commitment to \nfair dealings between Minnesota Power and other entities.  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMinnesota Power Initial Brief \nAttachment A \nPage 2 of 11\n \n3 COMMITMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE ACQUISITION  \nCommitments  Testimony Locations  Benefits of the Commitment to Customers  and Stakeholders  \n16.Minnesota Power will identify any contracts over $1 million with an entity\nidentified pursuant to the commitment above and notify the Commission within 30\ndays of the execution of each contract not already disclosed to the Commission,\nwith a certification that the contract was negotiated executed at arm's length.Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nAnderson Rebuttal Sec. III. B. \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III.E. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. VII. This reporting and certification will augment current requirements to ensure that no self -dealing \noccurs related to the new investors, and to provide transparency to allow further investigation \nif concerns arise.  This further underscores the Partners’ commitment to fair dealings between \nMinnesota Power and other entities.  Setting the threshold for reporting of contracts at $1 million \nwould capture nearly 80percent  of Minnesota Power’s total annual spend today .  \nRatemaking and \nAffordability  17.The Company will not attempt to recover Acquisition costs from utility customers . Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.\nAnderson Rebuttal Sec. IV.  \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  This commitment ensures customers will not bear costs of the Acquisition.  \n18.The Company will not attempt to recover transition  costs related to the Acquisition\nfrom utility customers , except to the extent of savings.Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nAnderson Rebuttal Sec. IV.  \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  This commitment ensures customers will not bear costs of the Acquisition unless there are \ncommensurate savings to customers.  \n19.Regarding energy affordability for residential customers, there will be no reduction\nin Minnesota Power’s currently designed affordability program budget (formally\nreferred to as the Customer Affordability of Residential Electricity program or\n“CARE”) or the current CARE program eligibility process for the duration of the\nPartner s’ ownership of ALLETE.Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III.I. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  This commitment ensures that there is no reduction in service or benefits for low -income \ncustomers who participate  in the CARE program . This proposal provides customers with \nassurance that such program budgets or program eligibility will remain intact so long as the \nPartners own ALLETE.  \n20.In addition, the Partners will provide a financial contribution with the objective to\nsignificantly reduce residential arrears to pre -COVID -19 balances or lower, an\noutcome that would benefit all Minnesota Power customers while providing\naccount balance re lief to the most economically challenged residential customers.\nThis contribution will be used to temporarily augment the flat $20 discount and\nArrearage Forgiveness components of Minnesota Power’s CARE program. A\nsimilar arrearage forgiveness offering wil l be developed on a limited scope and\nduration basis for non -income qualified residential customers that successfully\nenter into and complete a 24 -month payment arrangement for arrears, pending\nconfirmation of billing system capability and reasonable level  of effort. A guiding\nprinciple shall be to leverage existing program design and system processes to the\ngreatest extent possible to maximize dollars that will directly benefit eligible\ncustomers. Drawing from the tremendous success of the collaborative st akeholder\nengagement process used to develop and propose previous modifications to CARE,\nMinnesota Power will coordinate with the Commission’s Consumer Affairs Office\nand the EnergyCENTS Coalition to refine this proposal and offering, inclusive of\neligibil ity criteria and outreach plans. Details will be shared with the other\nnonprofit organizations and interested stakeholders previously involved with\nCARE modifications for their input and awareness prior to implementation. This\nfinancial contribution from t he Partners may be made in whole or in multiple\ninstallments over a period of up to two years following system implementation and\ncustomer outreach, contingent upon the Commission’s order approving this\ntransaction. The total financial contribution is not to exceed the total balance of\nresidential customer arrears as of the approval date.Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX. \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III.I \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  This commitment was developed in partnership with EnergyCENTS Coalition and provides a \nnew, historic  shareholder benefit of up to $3.5 million  to the Company’s most vulnerable \ncustomers, helping them erase long -standing residential arrearages. This is a first -of-its-kind \ncommitment  that provides benefits to residential customers that would otherwise be born by \nother customers. The intent of this commitment  is to help Minnesota Power customers reduce \narrears to pre -COVID -19 balances or lower . \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMinnesota Power Initial Brief \nAttachment A \nPage 3 of 11\n \n4 COMMITMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE ACQUISITION  \nCommitments  Testimony Locations  Benefits of the Commitment to Customers  and Stakeholders  \n21.At the request of EnergyCENTS Coalition, Minnesota Power and the Partners\naffirm their understanding that the budget billing provisions in Minnesota Statutes\n§216B.098, subdivisions 2 and 3, refer to all residential customers and is not\nlimited to those who are formally income -qualified. This is consistent with\nMinnesota Power’s electric service regulations and practices.Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  While this is currently Minnesota Power’s practice, there is no regulatory requirement that \nMinnesota Power is prohibited from requesting that only those who are income -qualified be \ncovered under the budget billing provisions of Minnesota Statutes. This commitment assures \ncustomers of the Company’s and the Partners’ understanding of this provision.  \n22.For as long as Minnesota Power is owned by the Partners, ALLETE’s contributions\nto the Minnesota Power Foundation will not be reduced.Alley Rebuttal Sec. III.I \nCady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  This commitment ensures that Acquisition by the Partners will not have any negative impact \non funding at the Minnesota Power Foundation, which provides impactful grant funding to \ncommunities  throughout Minnesota Power’s service territory. The Partners commit to \nproviding the same level of support to local communities.  \n23.Minnesota Power will not seek rate recovery of flotation costs beginning with its\nnext rate case and continuing so long as the Partners own Alloy.Taran Rebuttal Sec. III.A. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  Minnesota Power would incur significant flotation costs if issuing equity in public markets and \nwould need to seek recovery in future  rate cases. With the Acquisition, flotation costs will no \nlonger be included in the cost of service, to the benefit of customers.  \n24.Minnesota Power  will not seek rate recovery of Investor Relations costs beginning\nwith its next rate case  and continuing so long as the Partners own Alloy .Bram Rebuttal Sec. X.  \nTaran Rebuttal Sec. III.A. Following approval of the Acquisition, Minnesota Power will continue to have Investor \nRelations costs for some time, but this commitment ensures that they will not be recovered from \ncustomers. If the Acquisition is not approved, Minnesota Power will continue to need an \nInvestor Relations team and would seek recovery of those associated costs in its next and future \nrate cases. These costs will continue beyond the closing of the Acquisition, but they will no \nlonger be a cost to customers.  \n25.The Partners will not charge fees for any business management or consulting\nservices provided to ALLETE or Minnesota Power .Alley Rebuttal Sec. III. C. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  This commitment ensures that any  business management or consulting services provided by the \nPartners  will not result in any costs to Minnesota Power customers.  Third party consulting costs \nthat contribute to the Company’s utility operations are otherwise appropriate included in the \ncost of service.  \n26.For as long as M innesota Power is owned by the Partners, M innesota Power  will\nnot request rate recovery of board compensation or expenses for any board member\nnot independent from the Partners.Alley Rebuttal Sec. III. C. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.   Minnesota Power’s rates include costs for  director  compensation and  expenses . After the \nAcquisition, this commitment will ensure that these costs are not requested for board \ncompensation or expenses that are not independent from the Partners.  \n27.The Company will have the burden to prove in its next rate case that no transaction\ncosts, nor the costs identified in the Ratemaking section of this proposal for\nexclusion from future rate cases, are included in the cost of service to be recovered\nfrom cu stomers.Bram Rebuttal Sec. X.  This commitment supports the Partners’ intention that the operation of the Minnesota Power \nutility will continue to be handled by the existing management team.   \nWorkforce and \nLabor \nProtections  28.The Company will maintain the current senior management team, subject to\nchanges to account for voluntary departures or terminations in the ordinary course.Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nAlley Rebuttal Sec. III. G. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. II. Minnesota Power currently has no regulatory requirement to maintain its current senior \nmanagement team, and there is no guarantee a different investor/owner would make such a \ncommitment.   \n29.Minnesota Power  nonunion  employees will maintain the same or better position\nand compensation and benefits for two years following the close of the transaction\nand all existing collective bargaining agreements will be honored.Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nKrollman Rebuttal Sec. II. A. \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.  Approval of the Acquisition further ensures the Company will be able to and will provide \ncompensation and benefits to employees  at their current level  for at least two more years , \nproviding important certainty to employees during a period of transition that allows Minnesota \nPower to continue to recruit and retain a talented workforce . \n30.Neither the Company nor the Partners intend to change Minnesota Power’s long -\nstanding practices with regards to contractors. For example, the Company routinely\ncontractually requires contractors and subcontractors to pay their workers\nprevailing wage as ev idenced by local collective bargaining agreements and to\nascertain local conditions, work rules, and union jurisdiction. The Company also\nseeks to deploy union labor wherever reasonably possible.Cady Rebuttal Sec. IX.  \nBram Rebuttal Sec. X.

CONCLUSION  .........................................................................................................................84 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n1 I.  INTRODUCTION \nLPI is an ad hoc consortium of Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers.  LPI \nmembers are some of the largest industrial users of energy in the nation with the cost of energy \nbeing roughly 25%  of the overall cost of production.  LPI has a significant impact on the state’s \neconomy, jobs, and taxes.  Collectively, during normal operations, LPI members contribute $5 \nbillion annually to the Minnesota economy, directly and indirectly support over 13,000 jobs  with \na collective annual payroll of more than $400 million, and pay more than $150 million annually in \nState taxes.  Similarly, LPI members pay the majority of Minnesota Power’s required revenues.  \nThis economic engine  in Northern Minnesota also pays roughly two -thirds of Minnesota Power’s \nannual revenue.  It therefore has a keen interest in the proposed acquisition of ALLETE, the associated investment plan, and how that will impact utility rates.   \nThe purpose of this proceeding is to examine the proposed acquisition of all outstanding \nshares of ALLETE, Inc. (“ALLETE”), of  which  Minnesota Power (the “Company”)  is an \noperating division, by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP Investments”  or “CPP” ) and \nGlobal Infrastructure  Partners (“GIP”) (together, the “Partners ,” and with ALLETE, the \n“Petitioners” or “Applicants” ) (the “ Proposed Acquisition” or “Proposed Transaction” ) and to \ndetermine if the  Proposed Acquisition is in the public interest. \nThe overarching request by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (the \n“Commission”) in the Order for Hearing was for the parties to engage in and develop a record \npertaining to a cost -benefit analysis.  After weighing the potential harms with the potential \nbenefits, as directed by the Commission, LPI  concludes that the Proposed Acquisition is not in the \npublic interest and recommends the ALJ and  Commission reject it.  \nThe record shows that this case is fundamentally about two things.  First, a capital \ninvestment plan and second, obtaining financing for that capital investment plan.  ALLETE is \nselling to global investment firms to obtain financing for what can only be de scribed as a \nsignificantly outsized investment plan.  The testimony shows that this plan is roughly $1 billion per year over a 20- year timeframe, driven by Minnesota Power, or  $20 billion.  To put this in \nperspective, that equates to over $83 million per month over twenty years.  Spread across Minnesota Power’s 150,000 ratepayers, Minnesota Power is proposing to spend over $550 per \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n2 month, per ratepayer.  Incorporating a rate of return, it is difficult to imagine what ratepayers’ \nmonthly bills will be in 15 -20 years.  To support this enormous capital investment, the testimony \nshows that ALLETE allegedly needs  more equity over the next five years than it has obtained in \nits 75 -year existence.  The testimony does not show this significant capital plan is consistent with \nthe public interest or that Minnesota Power could not raise equity in public markets , as it has done \nfor seventy -five years  at a much more reasonable pace.  \nInstead, the testimony shows that the Partners see an opportunity to have exclusive access \nto provide that capital in exchange for generous returns on this outsized investment, and even \ngreater returns if the Commission expedites these investments.  In fac t, the testimony shows that \nthe Partners are so eager to have exclusive access that they are willing to commit, as of this filing , \nto fully fund ALLETE’s equity needs over the next five years.  This eagerness should raise red \nflags, not a welcome banquet.  \nTo be sure, the testimony shows this exclusive access comes at a significant cost and risk \nto ratepayers.  \n• There is a cost in implicitly approving the outsized capital plan, which will cause \nMinnesota Power’s rates to skyrocket. \n• There is a risk that the Partners will sell ALLETE once they have realized their \nprofits, or sooner if the Commission does not approve the irresponsible capital plan.  \n• There is a risk that the Partners will act in their self -interest to directly influence \nand accelerate this capital investment to maximize returns  in the near term .  \n• There is a risk that the Partners will seek to de -risk cost -recovery of that investment \nvia various rate adjustment mechanisms.  \n• There is a cost in Minnesota Power ceding control of its budgetary and strategic \ndecisions to global investment firms.  \n• There is a cost in the dilution of Minnesota Power as a core asset in ALLETE. \n• There is a risk that a privately owned company will be less transparent than a \npublicly traded company. \n• And from LPI’s perspective, there is the potential significant cost of ultimately \nbearing cost responsibility for over $12 billion (two-thirds) of the $20 billion capital plan, \nwhich would jeopardize LPI’s competitiveness.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n3 ALLETE and the Partners have utterly failed to bear their burden of proof to demonstrate \ntangible benefits of the acquisition that outweigh these risks and costs.  The alleged concessions \noffered by Minnesota Power and the Partners amount to little more than restatements of existing \nobligations and do nothing to address the real and significant concerns raised in this proceeding.  \nLPI therefore respectfully requests the ALJ protect Minnesotans and Minnesota businesses and recommend the Commission deny the Acquisition.   \nThe Commission’s October 7, 2024, Order identified the following seven issues for Parties  \nto address in this proceeding.\n1  The table on the following page  shows the issue, LPI’s answer, and \ncitations to the section s of this Initial Brief where the issue is discussed.   \n  \n \n1  Ex. MP- 1 at 8 (Initial Filing – Petition for Approval).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n5 LPI concludes that the Proposed Acquisition poses severe risk and no benefit  to the public interest,  \nand that the ALJ should recommend that Commission  not approve it. \nII.  SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION \nA. ALLETE and the Partners  \nALLETE is a publicly traded utility company based in Duluth, Minnesota.  Minnesota \nPower is an operating division of ALLETE, also based in Duluth, that has the exclusive right to \nprovide retail electric service in various geographic pockets of a 26,000- square- mile area of central \nand northern Minnesota.2  ALLETE’s other regulated operations include Superior Water, Light & \nPower, an electric, water, and gas utility in Wisconsin, and eight percent ownership in American \nTransmission Company, an independent transmission company in Wisconsin.3  Additionally, \nALLETE is the corporate parent of BNI Energy, which owns and operates a lignite mine, BNI Coal, LTD, in North Dakota.\n4  ALLETE also has investments in unregulated clean energy \ninfrastructure through ALLETE Clean Energy and New Energy Equity.5   \nCPP Investments is a professional investment management organization that manages the \nCanada Pension Plan Fund on behalf of more than 22 million Canadians.6  As of March 31, 2024, \nCPP Investments managed assets totaling  C$632.3 billion, with a United States investment \nportfolio of C$267.6 billion (approximately US$197.7 billion) invested directly and indirectly in equity and fixed income in public and private companies across a variety of sectors including in \nreal estate, infrastructure, and energy.\n7  CPP Investments’ purpose is to maximize the rate of return \nfor its investments for the benefit of Canadians.8 \n \n2  Ex.

CPPIB -GIP-202 at 9 (2024 Annual Report for CPP Investments). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n6 GIP is a “infrastructure investor that specializes in investing in, owning, and/or operating \nsome of the largest and most complex assets across the energy, transport, digital infrastructure, \nand water and waste management sectors.”9  GIP has approximately $115 billion in assets under \nmanagement.10  GIP is funding the Proposed Acquisition through two funds, Global Infrastructure \nPartners V (“GIP Fund V”) and Tower Bridge Infrastructure Partners, L.P.

(“BlackRock”).13  Blackrock is a “publicly  \ntraded … investment management firm domiciled in the United States that provides investment management services to its mutual funds, investment accounts, and other investment funds.”\n14  \nNotably, while BlackRock currently owns approximately 13.2% of outstanding ALLETE shares,15 \nit will, through GIP and the transaction, exercise far greater control over ALLETE than it currently \ndoes.   \nB. The Proposed Acquisition  \nOn, July 19, 2024, ALLETE, GIP, and CPP Investments filed their Petition before the \nCommission seeking approval of the Proposed Acquisition.  According to the Petition, GIP and \nCPP Investments plan to form a new corporation, Alloy Parent LLC, to acquire all of ALLETE’s \nshares and interests.  \n \n9  Ex.

Other Regulatory Approvals \nIn addition to the approval the Applicants seek from the Minnesota Public Utilities \nCommission, the Company also filed for approval from the Public Service Commission of \nWisconsin  (“PSCW”) on July 19, 2024, in Docket No. 5820- DR-100, and from the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission (“FERC”), on July 19, 2024, in Docket No. EC24-105.22  The PSCW \napproved ALLETE’s acquisition application in relation to Superior Water, Light and Power \nCompany (“SWLP”)  on March 13, 2025, after parties to that proceeding waived their rights to a \ncontested case. 23  Additionally, on December 19, 2024, FERC approved the  acquisition  \napplication but noted that “ whether the Proposed Transaction fulfills the respective state \nrequirements for Minnesota Commission … approval is a separate question from whether the \nProposed Transaction is consistent with the public interest under FPA section 203, and our findings \nunder FPA section 203 do not  affect those agencies’ evaluation of the Proposed Transaction.”24 \nD. Public Comments  \nThe Proposed Acquisition has generated significant public discourse, resulting in the filing \nof roughly 414 public comments  as of the date of this Initial Brief .  Of those comments, the \noverwhelming majority, approximately 379, express explicit opposition to the Proposed \nTransaction .  Among the approximately 30 supporting comments, a majority of the commenters \nwork for ALLETE or Minnesota Power, and the comments largely express support for Minnesota Power’s leadership .  These supporting commenters generally overlook the incentive compensation \nALLETE’s leaders will receive upon closing and that these same leaders are ceding control of all future strategic decisions of the Company.  Opposition comments focus in large part on the \npotential for the acquisition to have an outsized impact on ratepayers and cause significant rate \nincreases, beyond what is tenable for local Minnesota Power customers.  Comments also highlight \nMinnesota Power’s noticeable absence of evidence to demonstrate that it struggles with access  to \ncapital, and lack of concrete commitment to comply with the Carbon Free Standard or ensure clean \nenergy is prioritized above profit.  \n \n  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n10 III.  LEGAL STANDARD AND BURDEN OF PROOF  \nA. Under Either Standard, whether a “Net Benefit” or “No Harm” Standard, the \nProposed Transaction Is Not in the Public Interest.    \nUnder any standard  of review , the Proposed Transaction should be denied because it poses \nsignificant risk and no benefits .  The Applicants acknowledge that “the definition of public \ninterest…is derived from the vast body of energy policy developed over many years in Minnesota \nand for each new matter before the Commission will depend on the then- applicable statutes and \nrules and  the circumstances of that matter.”25  Counsel for the Partners conceded during opening \nstatement s that “the Commission’s authority in this area is vast and comprehensive and that the \nCommission is going to use that authority to find the right balance and protect customers.”26  Here, \nthe burden of proof, and its application, are open issues for the Commission’s ultimate \ndetermination.27  \nB. The Commission Has Discretion in Applying the Public Interest Standard Required \nby Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 to Determine the Statute Requires a Showing of “Net \nBenefits” to Comport with  the Public Interest .  \nWhen considering approval of the acquisition, merger, or consolidation of a public utility \nin Minnesota, Minn Stat. § 216B.50 requires the Commission find that “the proposed action is \nconsistent with the public interest” before giving “its consent and appr oval.”28  However, the \nstatute does not prescribe a specific method in which the Commission must analyze the public interest standard – thus, the Commission has discretion in how it applies statutory public interest \n \n22  In the Matter of the Verified Petition of Superior Water, Light & Power Company for a Declaratory \nRuling or, in the alternative, for Approvals of a Holding Company Takeover , Docket No. 5820- DR-100, \nVerified Petition for Declaratory Ruling or, In The Alternative, For Approvals of a Holding Company \nTakeover (Jul. 19, 2024); Allete, Inc., Alloy Parent LLC, Docket No. EC24- 105-000, Application for \nAuthorization Under Section 203 of the FPA and Requests for Shortened Comment Period, Expedited \nAction and Limited Waivers (Jul. 19, 2024). \n23  Ex.

Indeed, state commissions have varied in how \nthey interpret similar public interest standards , and in its previous consideration of merger and \nacquisition cases, this  Commission has looked for meaningful commitments and benefits to \nratepayers that closely mirror those needed to satisfy the “net benefits” test (i.e., that a transaction \nleaves ratepayers better of f as a result).29  Again , the burden of proof, and its application, are open \nissues for the Commission’s determination.  However, persuasive guidance from  prior \nCommission decisions and other state commissions, as well as the distinct and monumental nature \nof this Proposed Acquisition, demonstrate that the “net benefits” standard most appropriately determines whether the Proposed Acquisition comports with the public interest. \nC. The Commission Should Look to Other State Commissions and Its Own Precedent \nfor Guidance on How to Apply the Broad Public Interest Standard in this Proceeding . \n Commissions differ in whether they interpret the burden of proof on a public interest \nstandard as requiring a showing of “no harm” or “net benefits.”  However, in cases most similar \nto the instant transaction, other state commissions and the Minnesota Commission have favored a \ndemonstration of net benefits.  \n1. The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission Denied an \nAcquisition Because It Provided No Net Benefits.  \nThe Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (“WUTC”), when considering \nwhether the joint application for transfer of property between Hydro One Limited (“Hydro One”) \nand Avista Corporation (“Avista”) would comply with public interest requirements contained in \n \n29  E.g., Ex.

Importantly, there too the WUTC  recognized that its determination of \n“net benefits” was based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding the reorganization of NW Natural and the associated commitments.\n34  In approving the reorganization, it found the \nreorganization would: (1) establish safeguards to ensure the utility’s capital structure, credit ratings, and cost of capital would not be harmed by other affiliates, (2) better insulate utility assets, \n(3) pro vide a net benefit to customers through facilitating better company responses to the \nchanging business environment of the natural gas industry, and (4) provide an annual credit to \n \n30  RCW 80.12.020 provides the Commission “shall not approve any transaction under this section \nthat would result in a person, directly or indirectly, acquiring a controlling interest in a gas or electrical \ncompany without a finding that the transaction would provide a net benefit to the customers of the \ncompany.”  \n31  Ex.

Such a showing requires substantial evidence and material commitments \nfrom applicants.  In its conclusion, the WUTC stated the “inherent risks of the proposed transaction for Avista and its customers are manifest and significant.”\n37  Despite the proposed commitments, \nring-fencing provisions, and customer protections, the WUTC determined the risk that Hydro \nOne’s principal shareholder would exert its power and authority over Hydro One in ways that \nwould harm Avista were too great.38  In that case, the WUTC found that the proposed transaction \noffered neither benefit, and in fact did “not even meet the lower bar of the no harm standard,” as it could not conclude that Avista and its customers will be better off with this proposed merger \nthan without it, and thus was not in the public interest .\n39  The WUTC is not alone in making this \nanalysis – many jurisdictions have applied a net benefit analysis to these types of transactions, and \nwhere they have found no benefits to ratepayers, denied consummation of those transactions.40 \n \n35  Ex.

The Commission Has Previously Found Cost Savings and Potential \nEfficiencies When Assessing the Reasonableness of a Merger or Acquisition.   \nThe Minnesota Commission has previously considered cost savings and potential \nefficiencies when assessing the reasonableness of a merger or acquisition, in pursuit of its statutory \ncharge under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 to determine the reasonableness of a merger or acquisition on \nthe basis that it is “consistent with the public interest.”  Unfortunately, the ALLETE acquisition \nglaringly lacks the cost savings and potential for improved efficiencies the Commission typically seeks to satisfy statutory public interest requirements for mergers and acquisitions. \nThe Commission has routinely cited cost savings and potential increased efficiencies as \nreasons a merger or acquisition comports with the public interest.  For example, in its Order \nApproving Petition and Requiring Compliance Filing, the Commission found O tter Tail Power \nCompany’s proposal to acquire a wind facility comported with the § 216B.50 public interest standard because it would produce cost savings for ratepayers, as well as “numerous \nefficiencies.”\n41  Additionally, in its order approving the merger of Northern States Power Company \nand New Century Energies, Inc., the Commission cited public interest benefits including \n \n67454 (Ariz.

ALLETE’s acquis ition will neither produce \ncost savings for ratepayers nor will it result in increased efficiencies between businesses or power producers.  As such, and considering its pattern to seek evidence of cost savings and increased \nefficiencies to demonstrate publ ic interest benefits, the Commission will be hard -pressed to justify \napproval of the instant transaction.\n47 \nD. A “Net Benefits” Standard Should Apply to The Proposed Transaction Based on the \nSignificance of the Proposed Acquisition. \nAlthough the Commission does not have a brightline test under which to analyze whether \na transaction comports with the public interest, the Commission has discretion to apply the \nmandate of Minn Stat. § 216B.50 in the way it sees fit.  The public interest standard in this case \nposes a different question – the Commission has not been asked to simply weigh the sale of a \ngeneration facility , or even the merger of two utilities .  Rather, the issue before the Commission \nappears to be a matter of first impression , and it is  tasked with determining whether the sale of one \nof the state’s most prominent public utilities to private investors, who have no accountability to \nMinnesota ratepayers, comports with the public interest.  The unique and weighty question posed \nby the distinct set of facts in this case warrants a showing that the Proposed Acquisition will not only not harm ratepayers, but will provide them a net benefit. \nThe facts of each proposed transaction under this statute will differ, and the Commission \nwill need to weigh diverse and unique factors when determining whether each proposed transaction \ncomports with the public interest.  As stated above, at stake in this Proposed Acquisition is the \n \n46  Ex.

Given the significance of this determination, \nLPI believes the Applicants should have to comport with a higher standard (i.e., demonstrate the \nProposed Acquisition would provide customers with “net benefits”), fitting the magnitude of the \ntransaction for which they seek Commission approval.  In fact, the Commission has applied a “net \nbenefits” standard to  much less significant transactions, such as simple asset sales, as it did in its \napproval order regarding the sale of two liquid propane storage tanks.48  There, the Commission \napplied a “net benefits” standard  to find the proposed sale to be in the public interest because it \nwould “spare ratepayers from paying for the investments that would need to be made if Xcel were \nto retain ownership of the tanks ,…benefitting the region.”49  The Commission is no stranger to \nseeking such benefits when approving less significant transactions – as such, the same standard \nshould apply to complex acquisition s, and the Commission should apply a “ net benefits ” standard \nhere.50  \nE. The Evidence Offered by  the Applicants in This Case Fails to Demonstrate “Net \nBenefits .” \nUnder a “net benefits” standard, the Proposed Acquisition would fail to meet state public \ninterest requirements.  If the Commission carefully examines the record in this case, it will find the Applicants have failed to provide sufficient evidence that the Proposed Acquisition will \nprovide any meaningful benefits to its customers or the public.  For example, as an alleged benefit \nto ratepayers, the Applicants commit to honor union contracts and maintain long- standing practices \nwith respect to the unionizatio n of contracts.  However, the Applicants are already required by law \nnot to breach employment contracts, and simply maintaining the status quo provides no benefit to \n \n48  In the Matter of Xcel Energy’s Petition for Approval to Sell Two Liquid Propane Fuel Storage \nTanks, Associated Equipment, and Real Property to Flint Hills Resources Pine Bend, LLC , Docket No. G-\n002/PA-18-294, Order Granting Variance and Approving Sale with Conditions at 4 (Mar. 28, 2019). \n49  In the Matter of Xcel Energy’s Petition for Approval to Sell Two Liquid Propane Fuel Storage \nTanks, Associated Equipment, and Real Property to Flint Hills Resources Pine Bend, LLC , Docket No. G-\n002/PA-18-294, Order Granting Variance and Approving Sale with Conditions at 4 (Mar. 28, 2019). \n50  E.g., Ex.

Similarly, the Applicants propose affordability- related “commitments,”51 but not one \nof those commitments ensures affordable rates for industrial customers, which comprise two-thirds \nof Minnesota Power’s load.52  A condition cannot constitute a benefit where Applicants are already \nrequired by law to make such a commitment to ratepayers.  But for the Proposed Acquisition, many of the commitments would be unnecessary (i.e., committing to remain headquartered in \nDuluth, Minnesota, or maintain “ALLETE” and “Minnesota Power” names).\n53  Worse, the \nApplicants provide “no detailed plan outlining how the transaction will lead to cost reductions, operational efficiencies, or any improvement in service quality.”\n54  The Commission will find the \nproposed conditions are replete with items already required by law, or which already constitute standard practice for Minnesota Power.  Importantly, the existence of one-off benefits here or there \ndoes not satisfy the required demonstration that the totality of the transaction will result in a net benefit to ratepayers or the public.  The Applicants fail to show that the Proposed Acquisition \noffers any meaningful benefits to ratepayer s, let alone constitutes a net benefit  to ratepayers (i.e., \nthat they will be better off than if the transaction had not happened).  Proceeding from that failure, the Applicants cannot overcome the “net benefits” standard to properly contend that their Proposed \nAcquisition is in the public interest.  \nF. Even if the Commission Applies the Lower “No Harm” Standard, the Proposed \nAcquisition Can Be Determined to Comport with the Public Interest . \nWhile LPI would not contend that the “no harm” standard is appropriate to apply to the \nProposed Acquisition, application of that standard would have no bearing on the Applicant’s \nability to meet it.  The Proposed Acquisition would still fail to comport with the public interest \nbecause it would introduce harm to ratepayers that would not exist but for the Proposed Transaction.  For example, the exorbitant expenses associated with the acquisition, such as the \nsignificant acquisition premium being paid by the Partners, will likely result in pressure to reduce operational expenses, and  increas e rates through means such as a higher return on equity (“ROE”)  \n \n51  Ex.

Under Either Standard, t he Proposed Acquisition Is Not  in the Public Interest . \nThe Proposed Transaction  fails to offer synergies or efficiencies provided by previous \nmergers approved by the Commission.  Underpinning each standard is the requirement that the \nproposing company bears the burden to demonstrate that its Proposed Acquisition either does no \nharm or provides net benefits to ratepayers.  In the instant case, the Applicants provide no evidence \nto meaningfully satisfy either standard.  As such, LPI urges the Commission to apply a “net \nbenefits” standard to this transaction, given its magnitude and the significance for the company’s \nratepayers and the state.   \nThe Applicants brought this proceeding seeking approval of the Acquisition, and the \nApplicants bear the burden to demonstrate, under the issues outlined above by the Commission, \nthat the Acquisition is consistent with the public interest.  Unfortunately, LP I has been unable to \nascertain any record evidence of meaningful benefit to the Company’s ratepayers or the public.  \nFurthermore, there are no  benefits the Partners or ALLETE could offer to render the Acquisition \nconsistent with the public interest.

There Is No Benefit to the Acquisition, Which Is Premised on a Need T hat Does Not , \nand Should Not,  Exist.   \nThe Proposed Acquisition poses no benefits to customers.  Minnesota Power admits that \nthe Acquisition will not make its electricity safer, more reliable, or more affordable.57  Instead, the \nsole benefit they have touted is improved access to capital.58   \nAs an initial matter, the  Petitioners ’ continued emphasis of the alleged unfettered supply \nof capital from the Partners underscores that the Proposed Acquisition and the capital investment \nplan are one and the same – ALLETE would not have approached GIP and CPP without the alleged \nneed for the capital investment plan and GIP and CPP would not be acquiring ALLETE but for the financial rewards associated with that  capital investment plan.  The Proposed Acquisition is \npremised on the fact that ALLETE needs to raise significant capital in the next five years, but this \npremise is flawed for at least two reasons .  First, the amount of capital the Company says it needs \nto raise is unprecedented in its history.  Investing that amount of capital, which must be recovered from customers, would cause extreme rate shock,\n59 and as a result the Company’s capital plan is \nunreasonable and irresponsible to the customers the Company serves.  Second, ALLETE has never  \nhad difficulty in raising capital, and the record is devoid of evidence establishing any need for \nprivate equity to intervene, other than the public market might not readily invest because the \namount of capital the Company seeks is outsized and unreasonable .  There is no demonstration \nthat this significant capital investment plan is consistent with the public interest or that it would \nnot be better moderated via the traditional controls of regulation through access to the capital \nmarkets .60 \n \n57  Hearing Trans .

Minnesota Power  Should Mitigate Its Unreasonable Capital Plan, or the \nCommission Will Have To. \nThe Company has introduced two forecasts supporting its capital plan.  In its most recent \ncapital structure filing at the Commission, the Company’s five -year regulated capital expenditure \nforecast calls for $4.2 billion of capital expenditures for its regulated operations, plus more for \nALLETE’s nonregulated operations.61  This capital forecast creates a need for ALLETE to issue \napproximately $1 billion of new equity, in addition to significant new debt issuances and refinancing.\n62   \nMinnesota Power Witness Scissons referenced a longer -term capital forecast, referenced \nin the Company’s Proxy Statement, that includes both ALLETE’s regulated and non- regulated \noperations and calls for $20 billion of capital expenditures over the next 20 years.  T he Proxy \nStatement Forecast requires roughly [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION BEGINS …  … HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS] in new equity than the Capital \nStructure Forecast through 2028.63  Mr. Scissons stated the planned capital expenditures will be \nused to “reduce carbon, expand renewables, enhance resiliency and reliability of the transmission grid, and also to support the Company’s non- regulated renewable businesses that bring diversity \nto ALLETE.”\n64  According to the May 2024 proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission (“SEC”) , the Board primarily considered this 20- year forecast in assessing \nALLETE’s capital needs and Proposed Acquisition.65 \nThe capital expenditures forecast by ALLETE and the Partners in the Proxy Statement \nForecast  show investment levels in excess of [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \n \n61  Ex.

As GIP \nWitness Bram explains explicitly in testimony, GIP views ALLETE as a unique opportunity to \ninvest in a growth- oriented regulated electric utility with high -quality assets across both regulated \nutilities and unregulated renewables, in alignment  with GIP’s investment criteria.71  Mr. Bram \nspecifically testifies that “GIP’s decision to pursue the Acquisition is directly tied to ALLETE’s \nsignificant expected growth, which is being driven by the need to comply with Minnesota’s Carbon \nFree Standard and require Minnesota Power to invest  unprecedented capital to decarbonize its \ngeneration fleet without compromising reliability.”72  In other words, ALLETE’s significant \nexpected growth in rate base serves as the Acquisition’s primary driver  as Minnesota Power invests \nto comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard.  In addition, Minnesota Power’s alleged need \n \n70  Hearing Trans. Vol. 1 at 311:4- 12 (Taran).  \n71  Ex. MP-14 at 4:10-13 (Bram Direct) . \n72  Ex.

If Minnesota Power  or the Commission scales back the  capital \nprogram in a significant and meaningful way to maintain affordable rates, it is not clear whether  \nthe Partners would retain interest in the Acquisition without the ability to deploy their desired amount of capital .  If the Partners are not , then the parties will likely find themselves repeating this \nentire process when the Partners decide to exit their position and sell ALLETE.\n75  A very \nsignificant portion of the capital program occurs between now and 2030, potentially teeing up an \naffordability crisis and an exit by the Partners in just a few short years, as 2035 would be a \nrelatively short hold time.76 \nEven the Company witnesses recognize that financing the exorbitant capital plan is \nexceedingly risky.  Mr. Taran, for example, stated that ALLETE has a “high likelihood” of facing \na significant market disruption, and thus an attempt to issue the amount of equity Minnesota Power \nwill need across the next five years creates an “enormous” amount of risk, such that it would not \nbe “responsible for the Company to move forward” as a publicly traded company.77  Mr. Scissons \nhighlighted the risk of ALLETE being forced to issue shares below book value during a significant \n \n73  Ex.

As Witness Addonizio states ,“If ALLETE’s actual capital spending more closely \nmatches the capital structure forecast, raising the equity capital needed to fund it should be much \neasier, and lessen the importance or need for ALLETE to improve its access to capital.”80  Indeed, \nALLETE has options to reduce the amount of capital it needs to raise.  For example, Witness \nLebens proposed five methods by which ALLETE could mitigate its capital needs:   \n1) Using power purchase agreements (PPAs) to procure power from third parties;  \n2) Allowing customers the freedom to more easily produce their own energy;  \n3) Selling non- core assets to raise cash;  \n4) Slowing dividend growth and using the retained earnings to help fund investments; \nand  \n5) Encouraging customers to participate in load-flexibility programs .81 \nIn addition, ALLETE could choose not to pursue certain capital projects.  “It is a normal \nstate of affairs for companies to be unable to pursue every capital project they would like to for \nany number of reasons, including lack of access to capital or lack of management bandwidth.”82  \nALLETE could pursue slower dividend growth, reinvestment in retained earnings and the use of renewable energy credits and power -purchase agreements to lower the cost of compliance  with the \n \n78  Ex.

Minnesota Power simply cannot invest the projected amount of capital \nand maintain reasonable rates, and if the Company refuses to mitigate its capital plan, the \nCommission will have to control and slow the Company’s planned pace of investments  to maintain \naffordability , which would more closely align Minnesota Power’s capital plan with other \nutilities .94  Minnesota Power has put the Commission as the backstop to maintain affordability, \nnoting the Commission “would have to fully abdicate its duties for the concerns about rates and affordability to come to fruition.”\n95  Read in conjunction with commentary from the Partners, \nALLETE apparently believes it is appropriate to push the Commission to its regulatory limits in evaluating ALLETE’s aggressive capital spending plan of over $83 million per month over the \nnext twenty years.  ALLETE does not, and should not, need this amount of capital —this level of \nspending will cause  severe rate shock.  The premise for this Proposed Transaction is flawed  and \nignores ratepayers’ interests . \n2. Minnesota Power and ALLETE Have Sufficient Access to Capital . \nWhile ALLETE claims the purpose of the Acquisition is to improve access to capital, the \nCompany has not demonstrated that it has , or will have , difficulty accessing capital.  For example, \nALLETE stated in its 2024 10- K, filed with the SEC in February 2025:  “ We are well positioned \nto meet our  financing needs due to adequate operating cash flows, available additional working \ncapital, and  access to capital markets.  We will finance capital  expenditures from a combination \nof internally  generated funds, debt, and equity issuance proceeds.\n96 \nEven after it was previously downgraded in 2020, S&P noted “ALLETE has sound \nrelationships with its banks, and a satisfactory standing in the credit markets.”97  Prior to the \nannouncement of the Proposed Acquisition, the Company’s credit standing had improved.

For example, in 2023, S&P reported ALLETE’s FFO/Debt ratio was 19.55%, up from \n15.84% in 2022.  Similarly, in 2023, S&P reported ALLETE’s Debt/EBITDA multiple s decreased \nto 4.03x from 5.11x in 2022.  Importantly, in 2023, both metrics were in the best position since 2018.  Credit metrics at these levels are indicative of a strong, financially sound utility, with ready \naccess to the capital markets .\n98   \nSomewhat in response to criticisms that ALLETE has sufficient access to capital, t he \nPetitioners  claim that ALLETE needs a different kind of capital – private, not public equity – and \nthey repeatedly tout “patient capital” as an attribute of the Acquisition.  But ALLETE currently \nhas access to “patient” capital given the current ownership of ALLETE’s shares.  As shown below \nin Table 2, the overwhelming majority of ALLETE’s shares, almost 75%, are currently owned by \ninstitutional investors , such as BlackRock, the largest shareholder of ALLETE, which owns \napproximately 13.2% of ALLETE shares. 99 \n \n98  Ex.

Institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth \nfunds tend to invest in utilities because of their predictable cash flows, stable dividends, and long-\nterm growth potential.101  These characteristics align well with the long -term goals of institutional \ninvestors to meet liabilities and obligations over decades, which makes their investments more patient by nature.  Institutional investors are less likely to react to short -term m arket fluctuations \ncompared to individual retail investors.\n102  Utilities, being regulated and relatively stable \nbusinesses, generally fit well within their portfolio strategies aimed at steady returns over time, \nreinforcing the concept of patient capital.  Access to patient capital is not a new or novel concept \nfor ALLETE.  Again, almost 75% of its shares are currently owned by institutional investors.103   \nIn evaluating ALLETE’s current access to capital, Department Witness Addonizio \nconcluded that ALLETE’s access  is sufficient  and that many of the Petitioners’ stated concerns \n \n100  Ex.

This is \nconsistent with the point Witness Addonizio makes in his D irect Testimony that what the Company \ndescribes as a potential lack of access to capital is really more of a lack of willingness to use its access to capital .\n106  The Company has sufficient access to capital, especially if it reduces the \namount of capital it needs.   \nIn his Direct Testimony, W itness Taran argues that  the cost of accessing public capital \nfluctuates unpredictably,  even if ALLETE could raise sufficient capital from public markets.107  \nHowever, as noted in Ms. Lane ’s Direct Testimony,  “all markets have some degree of uncertainty, \nand the Company has not shown that raising capital in public markets would be unreasonably costly or difficult. ”\n108  The Company has not demonstrated an inability to access capital, in fact \nthe opposite is true, as acknowledged by Company witness Taran’s statement that “ALLETE has been able to navigate the risks of public markets in the past .”\n109  Consequently, the Company \n“presents the Acquisition as a solution to a purported problem but has not demonstrated that any \nsuch problem exists.”110 \nSimilarly, the Acquisition is not likely to improve ALLETE’s access to debt capital.  The \nProxy Statement suggests that one reason ALLETE is pursuing the Acquisition is to mitigate the \nrisk of “potentially challenging financial markets for debt offerings” it may face as a standalone \n \n104  Ex.

Given this, it is not clear how \nthe Partners’ banking relationships would be an advantage.113  When asked for further explanation, \nthe Company stated that its current bank group is reasonable and adequate.114   \nIn the end, ALLETE’s planned capital expenditures over the next several years are much \ngreater than its actual capital expenditures over the past several years and as a result, its need for \nnew debt and equity is large compared to its historical needs.  But ALLETE can mitigate and \nreduce its outsize d capital needs to improve its access to capital.  Witness Addonizio concludes \nthat ALLETE will likely have adequate access to capital to fund its planned expenditures as a \npublicly traded company without the Acquisition. 115  While remaining a public company may \npose some risks to ALLETE’s existing shareholders  (not customers), Witness Addonizio does not \nbelieve those risks are anywhere near as dire as the Company’s witnesses make them out to be, \nand shareholders are compensated for accepting those risks with a reasonable opportunity to earn \na fair rate of return as determined by the Commission.116  Further, while the Proposed Acquisition  \nmight eliminate some risk for ALLETE’s existing shareholders, it would expose Minnesota \nPower’s ratepayers to new and greater risks associated with the Partners’ apparent plans for \nALLETE, which are entailed below.  The Partners and ALLETE provide no indication that the \nAcquis ition will lead to better access to capital or lower costs to ratepayers  and the Acquisition \nprovides no benefit in this regard. \n \n111  Ex.

The Acquisition Will Not Improve Access to Capital or Reduce the Cost of \nCapital, but It May Increase the Cost of Capital.  \nThe Partners have not explained how the Acquisition will improve access to capital.  In the \nPetition, the Petitioners asserted that the capital provided by the Partners will be more “flexible,” \n“patient,” “reliable,” and “readily available” than the capital currently available to it via the public \nequity markets.117  However, the meaning of these terms in this context is not clear.118   \nIn addition to a general lack of evidence, i t remains unclear why the Petitioners believe the \nAcquisition will improve the Company’s access to capital.  Petitioners’ Witnesses have stated that \nALLETE’s public shareholders expect consistent quarterly dividend payments, but that the \nPartners will not require dividend payments and instead will allow the Company to reinvest the \ncash it would have paid out as equity.119  Witness Taran stated in his Direct Testimony that \naccessing capital via the equity markets means the Company is “vulnerable to economic cycles, geopolitical events, interest rate volatility, and other influencing factors.”  Petitioners’ Witness \nQuackenbush stated a company can be “inconvenienced” if it needs to raise equity at a time when \nits stock is underpriced, as it “may have no choice but to issue shares at a disadvantageous price, \npotentially raising less capital than needed.”\n120  Both witnesses asserted that ALLETE’s relatively \nsmall size and the nature of its customer base pose challenges to its ability to access capital.   \nNone of these  access  “improvements” withstand scrutiny.  The Company identified no \ninstances in the past in which it was unable to access the capital markets when it needed to, despite its size and customer base.\n121  Witness Addonizio, quoting Valuation, stated:   \nMany executives are tempted by the illusion that the absolute size \nor scale of a company brings benefits …in the stock market…. However, there is no evidence that size matters once companies \n \n117  Ex. MP -1 at 16 (Initial Filing – Petition for Approval) ; Ex. DOC -303 at 20:16- 18 (Addonizio \nDirect ). \n118  Ex.

The cutoff point probably lies in the \nrange of a market capitalization of $250 million to $500 million.122 \nWitness Addonizio disputes the Petitioners’ concerns about stock market volatility and mispricing, \nstating “Mr. Quackenbush and Mr. Taran greatly overstate the likelihood that ALLETE’s stock \nwill be mispriced, and to the extent such mispricings do occur, i t is not clear that being privately \nheld will mitigate the associated risks.”123 \nThe Company will not benefit from improved access to capital as a result of the \nTransaction.  Instead, the converse is true, and ALLETE might have less access to capital as a privately held company than it does as a publicly held company.  As a publicly traded company, \nthe capital available to ALLETE is  \nall of the capital available in the public equity market, which is vast, \ndeep, and liquid.  Any investor with available capital and a desire to \ninvest could provide capital.  If ALLETE in its current form tries to raise equity in the public market and one or two, or a hundred potential investors decide not to invest, there will be countless more that may be willing to.  Access to such a deep pool of capital is a \nmain point and large benefit of being a publicly traded company.\n124 \n… \n[Conversely,] [p]ost-transaction, [ALLETE]  will be solely \ndependent on Alloy Parent for equity capital.  Alloy Parent, in turn, \nwill generally have three potential sources of capital it can invest as equity in ALLETE: proceeds from its own debt issuances, equity capital from GIP -controlled funds, and equity capital from CPP \nInvestments.  If Alloy Parent is in a distressed situation such that it \ncannot issue its own debt to raise capital, and GIP and CPP Investments are unable or unwilling to provide equity capital to Alloy Parent, ALLETE will not have access to equity capital.\n125 \nWitness Taran stated that publicly traded companies compete for a finite pool of capital, \nwhereas the large amounts of assets GIP and CPP Investments have under management help assure \n \n122  Ex.

It will only have access to the $25 billion expected to be committed \nto GIP Fund V, and realistically it will have access to only a fraction of that committed capita l as \nit will have to compete with the fund’s other investments for it.127  Even if it were the case that \nALLETE would have access to all of the capital the Partners’ have under management, it would \nstill be a much smaller pool of capital than the public equity market.  And ALLETE will not have \naccess to anywhere close to the full amount of the Partners’ assets under management.128  There \nare realistic scenarios in which Minnesota Power’s access to capital would be more limited under private ownership than it would be with public ownership.  As Witness Addonizio states: \nThe Petitioners have provided little to no reason to expect that the \nAcquisition will meaningfully improve Minnesota Power’s access to capital.  Their largest stated concern, regarding stock market \nvolatility and market inefficiencies, is unsupported by evidence or analysis and is contrary to accepted financial theory and evidence from investor returns.  The Acquisition does not mitigate the \nconcerns the Company has expressed about needing to divest non-regulated assets or its ability to issue debt going forward as a standalone company.  Therefore, I conclude that the Commission should not consider improved access to capital as a potential benefit when considering whether the proposed Acquisition is consistent with the public interest.\n129 \nEven if the  Proposed Acquisition would lead to “improved access to capital,” that improved \naccess would not result in lower rates for customers.  As Witness Addonizio states “ [t]he only \nclear, definitive statement the Petitioners made about the meaning of  ‘improved access to capital ’ \nis that it does not mean access to capital at a lower cost than ALLETE would have available to it \nif it were to remain a standalone company.130  Minnesota Power has stated that the cost of capital \n \n126  Ex.

Minnesota Power is a foundational \ndivision of ALLETE, and ALLETE’s regulated operations represent approximately 89% of the \nprojected capital expenditure plan for the 2023- 2042 time frame,143 with Minnesota Power alone \ncomprising 87% of the projected capital plan.144  In comparison, if the Acquisition is approved, \nMinnesota Power will comprise a miniscule portion of the Partners’ extensive holdings in other \nprojects and sectors, diminishing the importance of Minnesota Power relative to the status quo.  \nAnd the resulting holding time for the Partners’ investment may be shorter than current \ninstitutional investors, meaning the Commission and stakeholders will be going through this \nprocess once again when the Partners feel that they have maximized value to themselves and their \ninvestors.  In the meantime, transparency has been and will continue to be reduced, while the \nPartners exercise significant control over the Company’s future strategic decisions.   \na. Minnesota Power Has Not Been Transparent with the Commission . \nAs the Department noted in its opening statement, “The record establishes that the Partners ’ \npublic representations to regulators and those that have been made privately to investors don't \nmatch up, and this shouldn't surprise anyone.”145  But more specifically, Minnesota Power has not \nbeen transparent to the Commission in its need for capital.  For example, Witness  Cady testified \nthat Minnesota Power would not be able to guarantee union contract s over the next two years, \nstating:  \nThere are a number of factors that can affect our business, so we are \nnot in position to guarantee benefits for two years into the future right now without the A cquisition…. as we ’ve just experienced two \n \n142  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n… HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS] . \n143  See Ex.

If this is true, and not an overstatement of \nits needs, the Commission should be very concerned that Minnesota  Power has put itself into the \nposition that they cannot afford to pay their employees and honor its union contracts without resorting to private equity.   \nSimilarly, the Commission has already approved projects equating to roughly half of the \nCompany's anticipated capital expenditures over the next five years, as Witness Cady explained \nduring the hearing:   \nBY MR. ANDREW MORATZKA:  \nQ Has the Commission already approved components of Minnesota \nPower's $5 billion capital plan for the next five years? \nA Yes.  \nQ Approximately how much? A I believe roughly about $2 billion. Q And do you know roughly what those investments are to cover? \nBroad categories - generation, transmission? \nA There are two large transmission projects that the Commission \nhas approved - our HVDC modernization line and the Northland \nreliability project, which together costs more than $2 billion.   \nQ And during those proceedings, did you ever tell the Commission \nthat Minnesota Power would be unable to finance those projects \nwithout resorting to private equity?  \nA We did not. Q To your knowledge has Minnesota Power ever conveyed to the \nCommission the total amount of projected rate increases associated with the $5 billion capital plan?  \n \n146  Hearing Trans .

A They have not approved --  \nQ Okay.  \nA -- the 5 -year capital plan, that's correct.  \nQ To your knowledge has the Commission issued an order that the \n$20 billion 20- year capital plan is consistent with public interest?  \nA The Commission does not approve forward-looking capital plans from any utility in the state, so no.\n147 \n  \n \nMinnesota P ower  has recently secured Commission approval for $2.5 billion in investment, but it \nnever disclosed to the  Commission that it could not raise the capital necessary to make those \ninvestments  without resorting to private equity.    \nb. The Partners Have Not Been Transparent in This Proceeding  and Will \nNot Be Transparent if the Acquisition Is Approved.   \nApplicants claim that their commitments and proposed safeguards will protect Minnesota \nPower’s customers.  But their case is undermined by a consistent lack of transparency.  Throughout \nthis proceeding, the Applicants have objected to many information requests, provided answers that \nwere nonresponsive to intervenor and party inquiries, have provided heavily redacted responses to \ndozens of discovery requests, and have employed multiple levels of confidentiality designations, \nwhich only a very limited number of stakeholders were allowed to access , preventing meaningful \n \n147  Hearing Trans.

This is problematic for several reasons.  The reduction in reporting \nrequirements means that critical information about the company’s performance, strategic decisions, and potential risks can be obscured from public view.\n156  Consequently, regulators have \nless insight into the company’s operations and financial health, which undermines transparency and accountability.  Specifically, regulators have less ability to monitor the company’s decisions \nand hold management accountable for practices that could lead to inefficiencies or excessive profits at the expense of the public interest.\n157 \nIn contrast to private equity, public ownership ensures accountability in ways that might \nbe lost under private equity ownership.  Publicly traded companies, especially those in critical \ninfrastructure sectors like utilities, are held accountable through a  combination of regulatory \noversight, investor scrutiny, and public reporting.  These filings include various FERC reporting \nrequirements, state agency reporting requirements, and SEC reporting requirements.158  Public \nownership forces a company to regularly report performance metrics, engage with a diverse shareholder base, and face questions from regulatory bodies and the media.  This level of \naccountability helps ensure that decisions are made in the public interest.  Under private equity \nownership, many of these layers of accountability are weakened or removed, leaving fewer checks \nand balances on potentially profit -driven decisions that will reduce transparency and could \ndisadvantage ratepayers.\n159  The ability for ratepayers to scrutinize the operation of their utility \nwould be greatly reduced by a lack of transparency that comes with private equity ownership. \n \n155  Ex.

This is an area of co ncern because without a firm commitment in the Merger Agreement,  \nthere is nothing preventing the Partners from removing uncooperative management (i.e.,  \nmanagement that is not aligned with the Partners) from Minnesota Power. \nIn short, the GIP and CPP witnesses made the Partners’ intentions on managing ALLETE \nabundantly clear in the agreements those witnesses executed and shared with ALLETE \nmanagement.  If the acquisition is approved, it will be the Partners (not ALLETE) that w ill be \nsetting the strategy and planning going forward.  The revised governance document attached to Witness  Bram’s Surrebuttal T estimon y solidifies this intent of the Partners and the Partners will \ntotally control the Board and therefore Minnesota Power, which creates a risk that Minnesota Power will lose management independence and the risk that the Partners’ interests will prevail \nwhen there is a conflict between their interests and the interests of Minnesota Power and its \nratepayers.   \nThis level of control and influence is concerning because decision- making regarding \nMinnesota Power’s business plans and operating and capital budgets will shift away from local \noversight to the Partners, which have an incentive to drive an increase in Minnesota Power’s rate \n \n181  Ex.

Mr. \nScissons\n’ opening statement asserting that “[n]o changes are anticipated in terms of how \nMinnesota Power develops its strategy and planning,”192 is therefore entirely inaccurate.  \nFurthermore, and as noted above,193 any attempt by ALLETE to distinguish its plans from \nthat of the Partners in an attempt to downplay their aggressive plans to maximize returns falls flat.  \nThe record evidence in this proceeding is that the Partners will control all important future \ndecisions by ALLETE.  In fact, it appears the Partners are already exercising these rights with \nrespect to Minnesota Power’s decisions.

The Partners Will Seek to Maximize Their Return .  \nThe dilution of Minnesota Power as a “Core Division” of ALLETE is concerning.  \nGenerally speaking, private equity companies are investment firms that pool capital from \ninstitutional and high-net- worth investors to acquire equity ownership in private companies or \npublicly traded companies they intend to take private.  Their primary go al is to generate significant \nreturns by improving the financial performance or strategic position of the companies they invest \nin.  These firms typically use a combination of investor equity and debt (leveraged buyouts, or \nLBOs) to finance acquisitions. \nPrivate equity is characterized by high illiquidity, requiring long- term commitments from \nits investors, and carries higher risks than seasoned public equity investments.  Private equity \ninvestments generally offer higher expected returns to compensate for  these increased risks, \nmaking them a potentially rewarding but demanding investment class.196  In this instance, based \nin part on the massive investment they intend to make to rate base, GIP has advertised that the GIP \nFund V is targeting a 15-20% annual return.197   \nThe Partners are transparent about their intentions to maximize MP’s growth.  In their \nrespective direct testimonies, both GIP and CPP make their intentions to maximize the return on \ntheir investment in MP, explaining that they are obligated to do so.  GIP states l ike any other \ninvestor, it “seeks to maximize the return on its investments and has an obligation to its investors \nto try to do so.”198  Similarly, CPP notes that private investments “ help CPP Investments fulfill its \nstatutory mandate to maximize returns for the CPP …”199 \n \n196  Ex.

In addition, private equity firms typically have performance -based \ncompensation plans that offer employees financial incentives linked to  the increase in value of the \nassets they acquire.  The Partners  and their fund managers have powerful organizational and \npersonal incentives to increase the value of Minnesota Power .  If the Acquisition is approved, \nMinnesota Power will be in a position where its equity holders demand  a higher average return \nthan has been demanded by ALLETE shareholders in the public markets.  All else being equal, \nhigher returns for Minnesota Power’s shareholders can be achieved by growing the rate base \nthrough increased investments in capital infrastructure, growing the authorized ROE by \naggressively petitioning the Commission for a higher ROE , or both.   \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET BEGINS…  \n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n200  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n…HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION \nENDS].  \n201  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n …HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION \nENDS].  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n58 … HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE \nSECRET INFORMAT\nION ENDS] . \nSimilarly, [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET  INFORMATION \nBEGINS … \n…HIGHLY CONFIDENT\nIAL TRADE SECRET  INFORMATION ENDS] . \nDepartment Witness Addonizio noted in his D irect Testimony that, as recognized by the \nPetitioners, the Commission will continue to set Minnesota Power’s authorized rate of return on \nequity in rate cases, and thus, [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL  TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION BEGINS … \n…HIGHLY C ONFIDENTIAL  \nTRADE\n SECRET INFORMATION ENDS] . \nGIP responded to these concerns in R ebuttal Testimony [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL \nTRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS … \n206[H IGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …\n…HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS].  \n207[H IGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …\n…HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS].  \n208[H IGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …\n…HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS].  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n59  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n … HIGHLY CONF\nIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET  INFORMATION ENDS ] . \n \n209  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS…  \n …HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION \nENDS].  \n210  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS…  \n…HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION \nENDS].  \n211  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS…  \n …HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION \nENDS].  \n212  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n    … HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS].  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n61  … HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET  \nINFORMATION \nENDS]218  During the hearing, Minnesota Power tried to make the point that \nbecause none of the debt at the parent level will be recoursed to ALLETE, there is no cause for \nconcern.219  However, that contention overlooks that before any recourse protections would apply \nand represent a benefit to ratepayers, such as in the case of bankruptcy, Alloy could potentially take actions to try to extract cash from its investment in ALLETE that w ould otherwise be used \nfor the investments into the Company’s rate base, harming ratepayers regardless of the fact that debt at the parent level was non- recourse to ALLETE.\n220    \nIf the Partners employ financial engineering strategies to increase the returns they earn \nfrom their investments in Alloy, the extra debt may cause Minnesota Power’s cost of capital to \nrise, which would result in rates that are higher than they otherwise would have been absent the \nAcquisition.221  Specifically , “if Alloy is issuing debt outside of Minnesota Power’s regulated \ncapital structure and then using the proceeds from that debt to fund equity investments in ALLETE and Minnesota Power, then Alloy will be enjoying all of the benefits … of the tax advantage of \nbeing able to deduct interest, lower cost … but imposing all the risks associated with the extra \ndebt, or at least some of the risks, onto Minnesota Power and its ratepayers.”\n222  Under this  double-\nleveraged scenario, the Partners and Alloy Parent would glean all  potential benefits, with the \nnegative impacts accruing  to Minnesota Power’s ratepayers.”223  \n \n217  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n… HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS].  \n218  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS…\n… HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION ENDS].  \n219  Hearing Trans.

The Partners’ Commitment to Fund Minnesota Power Is Ephemeral . \nDespite the stated intentions and the investments the Partners will pursue to increase rate \nbase and drive their returns, the Partners will only invest in Minnesota Power and ALLETE to the extent th ey can yield returns commensurate with other investments.

There is no limitation on the Partners’ ability to borrow the money to make equity infusions in ALLETE.\n240  \nAlloy Parent has committed that it will not use utility assets to guarantee Alloy Parent debt, but this commitment does not prevent Alloy Parent from using its shares of ALLETE to guarantee \nAlloy Parent debt.\n241  Minnesota Power states only that it will be bound by the capital structure set \n \n235  Ex.

As described in GIP witness Bram’s testimony, \nGIP Fund V targets capital commitments from investors totaling $25 billion, and upon hitting that \ntarget, will introduce no new capital or investors .244  If, a few years in the future, the capital needs \nof its portfolio companies exceed its initial expectations, or its internally generated cash flows fall short of expectations, there are no guarantees that GIP Fund V will be willing or able to provide \nenough equity for Minnesota Power to make its needed investment.\n245 \nDuring the course of the proceeding, t he Partners offered  commitments to alleviate \nIntervenor concerns about a  potential lack of access to capital .  The Partners committed to provide \nMinnesota Power equity financing, including but not limited to equity infusion, deferral or \nreinvestment of dividends, or a  combination of both, in an amount equal to the equity financing \nrequired to fund  Minnesota Power’s five -year capital plan as reflected in its February 2025 10- K \nFiling.246  The merger agreement itself does not require the Partners to provide ALLETE with any \nadditional equity.247  Rather, the Partners made that commitment after the Intervenors filed Direct \nTestimony in this proceeding.248  The Partners made no commitment to fund anything beyond \nALLETE’s 5 -year capital plan – nothing in the 20- year long- term plan, and nothing specific to \nachieving compliance with the CFS.249  The Partners have not specifically committed to \nreinvesting dividends; they have only committed that they have the ability to do so if needed.250  \n \n242  Hearing Trans.

It is unclear how the Commission could enforce this  commitment \nif the Partners do not fulfill it.251   \nAs discussed above, t he Partners’ plans to issue debt as part of its commitment to funding \nthe capital plan are particularly concerning.252  Generally both of the Partners have provided \nmaterials in response to discovery that indicate they plan on having one or more of the Alloy \nentities issue substantial amounts of debt that would be outside of Minnesota Power's regulated \ncapital structure, ALLETE's regulated capital structure, and outside of the Commission's \njurisdiction.253  The financial models provided by the Partners indicate the same pattern of \nsignificant issuances of debt as an Alloy entity, and those issuances could negatively affect Minnesota Power’s cost of capital.\n254 \nPetitioners have attempted to argue that none of the debt issued by the Alloy entities will \nbe recoursed to ALLETE, and therefore Alloy’s debt issuances should not be of concern.  The non-\nrecourse nature of the issuances, however, does not alleviate concer ns.  If Alloy is in financial \ndistress, it could start to extract cash from its investment in ALLETE that would otherwise be used for rate base investments.\n255  The issuance of debt at the Alloy level therefore could hurt ratepayers \nin two ways:  it could jeopardize the amount of capital available to ALLETE; and the issuances would impose risks on ratepayers, but they would receive none of the benefits.  As Witness \nAddonizio testified: \nIf Alloy is  issuing debt outside of Minnesota Power's regulated  \ncapital structure and then using the proceeds from  that debt to fund \nequity investments in ALLETE and Minnesota Power, then Alloy \nwill be enjoying all of  the benefits that I described in my direct \ntestimony of issuing debt, which is the -- kind of the tax advantage \nof being able to deduct interest, lower cost, without -- but imposing \n \n251  Ex.

But again, t here is no guarantee that the Acquisition will \nresult in ALLETE’s access to the capital it needs to fund all of the projects included in its capital \nplans.

If the Partners Do Not Earn Their Stated Return, Continued Funding for \nMinnesota Power Will Be Jeopardized and the Partners Will Exit Ownership of ALLETE. \nGiven the types of investors that comprise the Partners, it is likely ALLETE will be sold in \nthe near future, in less than ten years, if the Acquisition is approved.

The following facts raise alarms regarding the short -term \nnature of the Partners’ planned investments.   \nThe Partners do not commit to owning ALLETE for a set period of time.  In their opening \nstatement the Partners stated “ Some parties are concerned that the Partners may sell their \ninvestment in the future.  That is possible.  While there are no plans to do that at this time, most \ninvestments are eventually sold, and the Partners are not trying to conceal that it is possible down the road…”\n263  When asked what commitments CPP Investments is making to the Commission in  \nterms of the number of years it will own ALLETE shares, CPP Investments stated that  “CPP \nInvestments does not have a pre -determined hold period or fund life for its  infrastructure \ninvestments.”264  Similarly, when asked to provide the number of years for  which GIP is \ncommitting to not selling its shares in ALLETE, GIP responded that “GIP  has not otherwise made \na determination regarding the specific length of time GIP will continue investments by GIP Fund \nV.”265 \nThis lack of commitment is concerning, since [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE  \nSECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n \n260  Ex.

And this unwillingness to provide the full amount of Minnesota Power’s needs may \nprecede the next proposed sale under Minn. Stat § 216B.50 by a period of years. \nUtilities ’ planning horizons are long, requiring years to plan and build large and costly \ninfrastructure projects.  The Partners claim they are investing patiently, but that claim rings false.  \nAs discussed above, if the Partners wanted to be a patient investor in ALLETE, they could buy \nstock in the public market.  Instead, they are buying and commandeering the entire Company to \ngenerate higher returns than would be available in the public market.  Common sense dictates that \nthey will not invest in Minnesot a Power unless they are able to earn a return that is commensurate \nwith their projections , and they have admitted that in this record, by not committing to a guaranteed \ntime of ownership .  The Partners have obligations to their investors to earn the return they have \nprojected.  That return is likely not available to the Partners because the planned investments will \ninordinately grow rate base and result in rate shock.  The Partners appear ready to make risky debt -\nintensive contributions from Alloy Parent to ALLETE to supplement their return on rate base \nthrough other avenues.  The Partners’ investment plan is risky and problematic in a  regulated \nindustry that requires long- term planning wi th all investment costs borne by ratepayers .  It seems \nlikely the Partners will not be able to reap their stated returns, and therefore, it is likely they will \nown ALLETE for only a short time and then exit their investment.     \n \n270  Ex.

The Partners’ Control of the ALLETE Board and Their Investment and Exit \nStrategies  Threaten Compliance with the C arbon F ree Standard. \nIn 2023, the Minnesota legislature enacted a Carbon Free Standard (“CFS”) which requires \nelectric utilities to provide Minnesota customers with power that is 100 percent carbon free by \n2040.  Minnesota Power has established decarbonization goals, which its 2025- 2039 Integrated \nResource Plan (“2025- 2039 IRP”) intends to facilitate, specifically by curating an annual energy \nportfolio resulting in 80 percent renewable energy by 2030, and 90 percent renewable energy by \n2035 (Docket No. E015/RP -25-127).272  Minnesota Power intends to add 400 MW of new wind \nprojects by 2035 and expand energy storage resources by 100 MW by 2035.   \nDespite its decarbonization goals, Minnesota Power’s  2025- 2039 IRP  proposes to add \napproximately 1,000 MW of natural gas capacity to replace baseload generation at Boswell Energy Center, on top of its existing natural gas generation .  Part of its plan accounts for  its share of the \nNemadji Trail Energy Center (“NTEC”) , a natural gas plant being built in Superior , Wisconsin by \nMinnesota Power, Dairyland Power Cooperative, and Basin Electric Power Cooperative, the \ncontracts for which remain in effect today.  While the Commission requests comment on \nMinnesota Power ’s ability to comply with the CFS in relation to any proposed modifications of \nplans associated with the NTEC, LPI unfortunately cannot provide detailed comment because the \n2025- 2039 IRP provides scant information on its intended treatment of NTEC.  In its 2025-2039 \nIRP, Minnesota Power  states that although NTEC and associated contracts are still in effect, it did \nnot include NTEC in its starting point Load and Capability Forecast, or its Capacity Expansion \nanalysis, as it is restudying the need for natural gas generation in its 2025- 2039 IR P.\n273  However, \nMinnesota Power  also states that to ensure it has dispatchable reliability resources to “meet \nunexpected customer needs, it will develop 750 MW of combined cycle natural gas generation to \nbe in service by 2035.”274  In pursuit of that goal, Minnesota Power  states, “[o]n receipt of final \npermits for the Nemadji Trail Energy Center (“NTEC”), and if available to meet IRP needs, the \n \n272  In the Matter of Minnesota Power’s Application for Approval of its 2025- 2039 Integrated Resource \nPlan , Docket No. E015/RP -25-127, 2025- 2039 Integrated Resource Plan – Initial Filing  Transmittal  at 1 \n(March 3, 2025) (eDocket No. 20253-215986- 11) (“2025-2039 IRP Initial Filing”). \n273  2025-2039 IRP Initial Filing at 29, 61. \n274  2025-2039 IRP Initial Filing at 26. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n74 Company will refile with the Commission as required,” per its last IRP.275  To the extent Minnesota \nPower  intends to proceed with bringing NTEC online, it will face significant obstacles in  \ncomplying with the CFS.  However, the ambiguity in the IRP as to Minnesota Power’s actual plan \nfor NTEC makes it difficult to provide meaningful comment on the matter.  \nNevertheless, it is clear t he Partners’ control of the ALLETE Board of Directors, and their \nillusory commitment to capital funding,  threaten Minnesota Power’s ability to comply with the \nCFS.  There is also a risk that the Partners will not follow through on their stated commitments to \nclean energy and, through their influence on the ALLETE Board, could direct the Company to \nchange its coal retirement schedule after the Acquisition.   Similarly, because the Partners  have \naggressive plans to maximize their returns , they have no incentive to employ the least -cost methods \nfor decarbonization, which could result in unsustainable customer bills  and thereby threaten \ncompliance with the CFS.   The Partners’ exit strategy  could also threaten Minnesota P ower’s \nability to meet state carbon reduction goals.  For example, if  the Company is  sold before it  ceases \ncoal operations, there is no guarantee that future owners would  follow through on current plans to \nretire Minnesota Power’s coal fleet.   The Commission should deny the Transaction, which would \njeopardize compliance with the CFS, and every other aspect of service provided by Minnesota \nPower.   \n8. The Commitments  the Partners Have Proposed Are Meaningless  and Do Not \nProtect Against the Risks of the Transaction.  \nThe Partners have made no commitments that would mitigate the risks of this Transaction .  \nIn addition to making several commitments in their original petition, the Petitioners proposed new \nconditions in Rebuttal Testimony in a further effort to gain approval of their Proposed Acquisition.  \nALLETE witness Cady summarizes the currently proposed conditions and her R ebuttal Schedule \nconsists of the following two broad categories:  “Commitments Specific to t he Acquisition” and \n“Additional Affirmations of the Reg ulatory Compact.”  Those two categories are further divided \ninto the following subcategories:  \n \n \n275  2025-2039 IRP Initial Filing at 26. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n75 1.

Workforce and Labor Protections\n276 \nNone of these commitments or affirmations meaningfully mitigate the risks of the \nTransaction.  As noted in the Surrebuttal Testimony of OAG Witness Lebens, the eleven \nconditions related to “Ratemaking and Affordability” mitigate rate increase to some extent, but none of which provide any assurances regarding the frequency or total size of future rate \nincreases.\n277 \nRegarding the financial commitments to Minnesota Power, t he Petitioners have proposed \na condition to partially mitigate the risk that the Partners could decide to reallocate needed capital \naway from Minnesota Power, by committing that Alloy Parent will fund Minnesota Power’s 5-\nyear capital investment plan.  But as discussed, that commitment is ephemeral  and, by definition, \nleaves open the ten years between 2030 and 2040.  The risk of Partners reallocating capital away from Minnesota Power is  only somewhat m itigated by the Petitioners’ commitment that Alloy \nParent will provide the capital “required to fund Minnesota Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan \nreflected in its February 2025 10- K filing, subject to prospective reasonable and prudent plan \nadjustments .”\n278  But, “Minnesota Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan”279 is not well defined \nin the February 2025 10- K filing that they reference.280  Moreover, the commitment only lasts for \n \n276  Ex.

For these reasons, the strength \nof the capital commitment being offered is unclear.  Additionally, they do not address the risk that \nthe Partners could over -allocate unneeded capital to M innesota Power, thereby increasing rates.281   \nRegarding the conditions related to mitigating the risk that board control could be abused, \nThe Petitioners offer four governance -related commitments.  The commitments largely focus on \nwhere some of the board members reside (Minnesota and Wisconsin) and who has the right to \nselect the members, rather than ensuring that those members selected do not have conflicts of \ninterest or raise other risks that board control could be abused via any appointment or removal \nprocesses .282 \nThe lack of adequate ring -fencing protections between Minnesota Power and ALLETE’s \nnon-regulated businesses is a situation that has existed for some time ,283 and the Partners have \nmade no concessions in this proceeding to protect Minnesota Power.  For example, Department \nWitness Vavro claims that Minnesota Power assets are not used to secure any ALLETE debt used \nby subsidiaries.284  Even if true, that alone does not offer sufficient bankruptcy protections to \nMinnesota Power and does not constitute adequate ring- fencing protection overall.285  The \ncorporate separation commitments set forth  in the Petition and further discussed in the Lapson \nDirect Testimony  are not, in and of themselves, sufficient  to hold ALLETE harmless from business \nand financial risk exposure associated with Alloy Parent as well as its subsidiaries or affiliates.   \nDeveloping effective ring- fencing protections for Minnesota Power, a utility that is not a discrete \ncorporate entity, would likely be very difficult without first implementing a holding company \nstructure.  Whether it can or cannot be accomplished without forming a holding company is not \nthe point.  What merits stressing here is that formation of a holding company has been a topic of \ndiscussion between Minnesota Power and the Commission for at least fifteen years.286  The \n \n281  Ex.

Because Minnesota Power already has a competent \nmanagement  team, which the Partners say they are planning to leave in place, and because the \nPartners say they are not planning any significant operational changes at ALLETE, access to the \nPartners’  expertise is not a meaningful benefit that might arise from of the Acquisition.287  In \ntestimony, Witness Alley of  CPP Investments discussed CPP Investments’ past investment in \nPuget Sound Energy and highlighted its relationships and ability to facilitate introductions  with \nCPP’s affiliates .  As the Department Witness noted, this example of “benefit” to facilitate an \nintroduction between Minnesota Power and Octopus Energy, a company in which CPP \nInvestments  owns a large stake, only heightens concerns about affiliate interest issues.  The \nPartners’ expertise and access to their affiliates is  not a meaningful benefit of this transaction.288 \nThe Department also notes that the three- year commitment to hold ratepayers harmless \nfrom increases in the  cost of debt resulting from the transaction is a weak concession.  The cost of \ndebt for  ratemaking purposes is determined using a utility’s embedded cost of debt, or the average \ninterest rate on its outstanding bonds, weighted by the principal balances of  those bonds.  The \nembedded cost of debt therefore changes slowly, as new debt  issuances get averaged into the \nutility’s existing stock of debt.  Therefore, there is not a great potential for Minnesota Power’s \nembedded cost of debt to rise much in just thre e years , and the Partners’ commitment to hold \ncustomers harmless from a rise in the cost of debt is meaningless . \nRegarding transparency, ALLETE and the Partners had demonstrated insufficient regard \nfor the regulatory compact, particularly as it pertained to transparency.  Overall, their commitments \nto information access did not indicate much transparency beyond the ALLETE level.  In rebuttal \ntestimony, Witnesses Alley and Bram reiterated their intention to provide access to books and \n \n287  Ex. DOC -304 at 24:11-14 (Addonizio Surrebuttal). \n288  Ex.

These are “affirmations” rather than formal commitments, and as such may not be \nenforceable unless contained in a Commission order and the Partners agree to submit to the Commission’s jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing such an order. \nUnfortunately, the affirmations offered throughout the development of this proceeding do \nnot represent a meaningful change in the Partners’  initial positions and fall short of providing \nadequate transparency.  ALLETE and the  Partners need to commit to providing broad access to \nbooks, records, data, and information from whichever e ntities are relevant to the Department’s and \nCommission’s  areas of review, including ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, as well as \ncompliance with rules and regulation (e.g., affiliated interest standards) and merger commitments \nand conditions.\n289 \nRegarding commitments to ensure proper Board governance and the independence of the \nALLETE Board, Witness Bram states that the Partners’ proposed governance structure is \nconsistent with other utilities, and he cites Xcel appointing the directors of Northern States Power  \nas an example.290  But that example only serves to show why the Partners  proposed governance \nstructure is inadequate to preserve independence and transparency.  Xcel appointing directors to \nthe boards of its utility subsidiaries is not at all  equivalent to complete control of the entire \ncorporate entity.  Xcel is not a private equity fund, but rather a publicly traded company with \nsignificant public reporting requirements.  Xcel’s own Board of Directors has corporate guidelines \ndefining membership criteria, director orientation, continuing education, expectations, and  \nevaluations, as well as defined governance, nominating, and compensation committees.  In stark \ncontrast to the proposal here, Xcel requires the majority of Board membership to be independent \ndirectors as defined by the Nasdaq Stock Market, which means they  will have no direct or indirect \nmaterial relationship with Xcel.  Among other reasons for  this structure, Xcel’s governance \n \n289  Ex. DOC -302 at 18:18-19:3 (Vavro Surrebuttal). \n290  Ex. MP-33 at 40:3- 5 (Bram Rebuttal).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCISED\n79 guidelines clearly state that the independent  requirement is designed to maintain the Board’s \nindependence from management.291 \nWitness Vavro states that there is no evidence to support the opinion that changing the \nproposed governance structure would have a chilling effect on investment in public utilities  – \nsomething the Partners cite as a reason not to adopt appropriate Board conditions.  That claim is \nbelied by other take -private transactions in which the parties agreed to  governance conditions that \nprotect the interests of the public utility and its ratepayers  while balancing the owner’s legitimate \nneed to protect its investment.  \nWhen El Paso Electric was acquired by Infrastructure Investment Fund (“IIF”) in 2020,  \nboth the parties’ stipulation and the Texas Commission’s Order required that El Paso  Electric have \nten directors —two from IIF, the El Paso CEO, and the remaining seven independent as defined by \nthe NYSE.  Of these seven independent directors, at least four  also had to be disinterested.  Clear \nDelegations of Authority echoing these provisions were attached to the stipulation in that case.  \nThe Texas Order adopted these provisions and required El Paso Electric to amend its bylaws to \nincorporate the  delegation of authorities and other commitments, and these governing documents \ncannot be changed without Commission approval.292  \nIn a similar vein, in 2023 the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the acquisition \nof South Jersey Industries (SJI), parent of two natural gas utilities, by IIF based on the stipulation \nof the parties.  Both the  stipulation and the Order in that proceeding required governance provisions \nmuch like  those in the El Paso Electric transaction.   New Jersey and Texas regulators further \nprotected the public utility and its  ratepayers by imposing certain voting protocols for specified \nmaterial events.  For example, a majority of independent director votes is needed to place SJI in \nvoluntary bankruptcy, and the majority of both IIF directors and independent directors is needed \nto approve certain budget variances for El Paso Electric.293  Overall, the agreed -upon governance \n \n291  Ex.

Nor \nhas GIP agreed to conditions customer for Commission approval.  For example , in the very \ndocument that prompted Bram’s Response Testimony  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE \nSECRET INFORMATION BEGINS…  \n \n   \n  …HIGHLY CONF\nIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION \nENDS].   \nRing- fencing protections are insufficient, and Minnesota Power is not adequately protected \nfrom the financial and business risks of ALLETE’s non- regulated businesses.  Similarly, the \nParties are unwilling to provide sufficiently broad access to books and records as may be required \nby the Commission in its oversight and decision-making role.  In all, the regulatory commitments \noffered by the Parties offer insufficient protections to ratepayers and the public against future harms.  \n9. The Partners Have Conflicts of Interest that Jeopardize Minnesota Power’s \nService to Existing Customers .  \nThe Parties are unwilling to fully comply with the Commission’s affiliated interest statute, \nwhich is meant to ensure sufficient transparency around utility contracting to prevent potential \nconflicts of interest.  As part of its list of commitments included in Rebuttal Testimony, Minnesota \nPower will require all suppliers and any industrial customers with contracted rates to identify \nannually whether they are more than five percent owned by CPP, GIP, or Blackrock and will list \nthose entities in its annual affiliated interest report.\n298  This commitment does not say anything \n \n297  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n… HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS] . \n298  Hearing Trans .

But Minnesota Power is not committing to seek \napproval of any of these contracts under the affiliated interest statute.300   \nIn Rebuttal, ALLETE and the Partners offered to provide additional information they \nbelieve would help mitigate concerns about potential self -dealing, but it falls well short of full \ncompliance with the affiliated interest standard.  \nIn the Direct T estimony  of Witness Vavro , she stated that ALLETE should comply with \nthe affiliated interest standards and accompanying regulations rather than using the “flexible view \nof affiliated interest requirements” proffered by Witness Anderson in his Direct Testimony.  The \nlatter approach left open the possibility of conflicts of interest and an opportunity for owners to benefit from preferential treatment in contracts and procurements involving affiliates of GIP, CPP \nInvestments, or BlackRock .\n301 \nIn Rebuttal, ALLETE and the Partners offered to provide additional information that they \nbelieve will help mitigate concerns about the possibility for self -dealing.  More specifically, \nMinnesota Power would require all suppliers and any industrial customers with contracted rates to identify annually whether they are more than five percent owned by CPP Investments, GIP, or \nBlackRock, and then report those entities on it s Annual Affiliated Interest Report.   Minnesota \nPower would also identify all contracts over $1 million with any of those suppliers or customers \nand notify the Commission within thirty days of execution, attesting that the contract was \nnegotiated at arm’s length.\n302 \n \n299  Hearing Trans.

If the ALLETE acquisition moves forward, Minnesota Power \nwill be the only utility in the state that is 100% owned by private equity.  The situation in which a \nregulated utility will be owned by only two entities  – 60% by one and 40% by another  – is quite \nunique.  If Minnesota Power does not track its affiliates and submit its affiliated transactions as \nrequired, the work of th e Commission and the Department to ensure that ratepayers are being \nprotected from self-dealing becomes extremely difficult , if not impossible.  To be sure, some \ntransactions with affiliates can benefit ratepayers, but some may not.  Regulators should know \nabout these transactions, so they can be more closely reviewed in a timely fashion, and that is what the statute is designed to do.\n303 \nApplicants Witness Lapson suggests that any risk of interference in the business affairs of \nALLETE by its new owners is no more problematic than that of other regulated utilities.304  But \nthere is no comparison to the instant Transaction.  None of the utility holding companies mentioned by Witness Lapson have two private owners with business interests in hundreds of other companies  \nthat may have conflicts with their utility.  They are also publicly owned, which offers additional \ntransparency.\n305 \nThe affiliated interested statute is in place as the mechanism for the Department and \nCommission to accomplish the monitoring of affiliated interest agreements and to protect \nratepayers from self -dealing by a public utility.  There is no evidence  in the record that the \nCommission will be able to effectively monitor conflicts of interest.  Rather than assist the \nCommission in its obligation to protect ratepayers, the Petitioners’  proposal would hamper the \nCommission’s ability to do so because Minnesota Power  would not be filing all relevant \nagreements.306 \n \n303  Ex.

CONCLUSION \nAs demonstrated above, there are significant concerns, and several potential harmful \naspects that far outweigh any potential benefits of the Acquisition.  The lynchpin of the Proposed \nAcquisition  is the exorbitant increase in rate base that will drive investment returns, as evidenced \nby a record replete with projected increases in capital investments.  Yet the Applicants fail to \nexplain how rate affordability will be achieved.  Minnesota Power’s  rates already fail to comply \nwith the goals set out in Minn. Stat. § 216C.05, subd. 2(4) given that all rate classes are not below 95% of the national average rates.  Approving the Acquisition to meet the requirements of the \nCarbon Free Standard, without consideration of the impact on rates and without serious \nmodifi cation, will potentially lead to an affordability crisis and put the Company in a dire situation.  \nSuch an outcome is inconsistent with the public interest.  LPI  recommend s the ALJ and \nCommission find the Proposed Acquisition is inconsistent with the publi c interest and reject it.  \n \n Dated:  May 1, 2025    Respectfully submitted,  \n \nSTOEL RIVES LLP  \n /s/ Andrew P.

T he \nfinal merger agreement  contains no binding capital commitment. Moreover, GIP and CPPIB \n(collectively, the “Partners”)  will only fund ALLETE’s energy transition if it maximizes near -term \nreturns  better than many alternatives . As a result, equity financing for ALLETE’s transition  could \ndisappear for a variety of plausible reasons. Even if the Partners do provide capital, the ir plan to \nuse risky financial strategies could financially weaken  ALLETE. Their plan  also could leave \ncustomer  rates nearly [NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . .  . . . NOT PUBLIC \nHCTS DATA ENDS] by 2030.2  \nDespite  the deal ’s risks  to ALLETE’s financial health, ratepayers, and the energy \ntransition , Petitioners  have proposed inadequate  governance and ring-fencing measures. And  \nPetitioners  have no plans  to comply with a state law intended to prevent conflicts of interest and \ncross subsidies between public utilities and other companies with the same owner.  \nGiven the speculative benefits and foreseeable risks, the Commission should reject the \npetition as currently proposed as inconsistent with the public interest.  \n  \n \n1 Minn.

LPI -1001 at 12 -13 (Walters Direct).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n2 FACTS  \nPrivate Equity Firms  \n \n P rivate equity firms commonly raise capital from investors in commingled funds  with fixed \nlengths.3 Once a private equity firm has raised a fund, it will seek to invest substantially all the  \nfund’s capital in companies  within four to five years , which become part of the fund’s portfolio .4 \nOnce the fund’s investment period ends, the firm will generally have little  ability to make new or \nfollow-on investments in the fund’s portfolio companies.5  \nPrivate equity firms typically seek to grow the portfolio company’s value during a four -to-\nsix-year hold period before selling it or taking it public through an initial public offering.6 Private \nequity firms typically seek returns that exceed  the stock market. Private equity firms focus on \ngrowing cash flows by increasing  portfolio company revenue, cutting costs, or acquiring \ncompetitors.7 Private equity firms often target gross investment returns of 15% to 20% per year.8  \nTo achieve above- market  returns, private equity firms often rely on “financial engineering” \nto generate investor returns .9 Financial engineering involves manipulating  the portfolio company’s \ncapital structure .10 For example, private equity firms often engage in “dividend recapitalization” \nto add debt to their portfolio companies’ balance sheets and then use the proceeds to collect \ndividends for themselves.11 Additionally , private equity firms may “double leverage” the portfolio \ncompany by having a holding company issue debt and then reinvest that debt in the portfolio \n \n3 Ex.

Governance engineering involves \nreplacing management and restructuring compensation to align the  manager  incentives with \ninvestor interests.15 Operational engineering refers to actively managing the portfolio company by \naltering  business practices, such as  through cost -cutting , to increase revenue.16  \nThe Partners  \n \nGIP and CPPIB  are private equity investors. GIP specializes in infrastructure -related \ninvestments.17 CPPIB, as the professional investment organization for the federal Canadian \nPension Plan, invests in a variety  of asset classes.18  \nGIP was founded in 2006.

On balance, the risks of the deal , as proposed, outweigh the \npossible benefits. And the regulatory commitments offered by Petitioners are inadequate to \noutweigh the deal’s  net harm. Because the deal as proposed is inconsistent with the public interest, \nthe Commission should reject it.  \nI.  P ETITIONERS HAVE FAILED TO ESTABLISH THEIR  DEAL  IS BENEFICIAL . \n Petitioners  assert their deal’s  primary goal is improving access to equity capital  for \nALLETE’s  energy transition.120 Despite this assertion, Petitioners have offered  little evidence that \nALLETE’s stated capital needs are accurate and, even if they are, that the deal will more reliably \nmeet those needs than the public market. R ecord evidence instead establish es that ALLETE’s \ncapital needs ar e likely overstated  and that the public market may  better meet its  needs. The \nsecondary benefit,  access to expertise, has little value.  \nA. The Record Establishes T hat the  Deal’s  Primary Purpose Was Not Secur ing \nCapital Access.  \n ALLETE claim s that this deal  is essential to secure reliable access to equity capital and \nthat continued public market reliance would leave it in a financially untenable position.121 Yet, as \nrecently as March 2024, ALLETE was prepared to proceed with its “ standalone plan,” relying on \nthe public capital market, a renewed focus on regulated operations, and more realistic equity needs \nto achieve its energy transition. The terms of the merger agreement similarly show that access to \ncapital was not the deal’s most primary  goal. \nALLETE repeatedly rejected offers from the only bidders , risking that it would be left with \nits standalone plan. [NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . .   \n \n120 See, e.g., Ex. MP-9 at 7 (Cady Direct).  \n121 See, e.g., Ex.

If remaining public was  as irresponsible as \nALLETE claims,126 it would have been equally irresponsible for ALLETE to risk having the only \nbidders walk over a minor premium difference.127 [NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . .  \n . . . NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA \nENDS] this history shows that securing access to capital was not the deal’s  primary purpose. \nThe merger agreement ’s terms similarly show that access to capital was not the deal’s \nprimary  goal.

The absence of  a capital commitment is particularly notable given that [NOT \nPUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . .  \n . . . NOT PUBLIC \nH\nCTS DATA ENDS] . The merger agreement similarly lacks any binding commitment by the \nPartners to re -invest dividends.130 This failure to obtain a binding, written commitment is, again, \nnotable given that ALLETE cites dividend re -investment as an example of how the Partners could \nmake capital available.131  \nAlthough ALLETE requires written contracts with its own suppliers  and agrees that written \ncontracts are important for complex or financially significant transactions , ALLETE dismisse s \ncriticism over the lack of written commitments , explaining that “commitments are not limited to \nwritten contracts[.]”132 It is not reasonable to believe that ALLETE’s board and senior \nmanagement would leave a key deal point in a $6.2 billion transaction unaddressed. Rather, the \nplausible explanation is that ensuring access to capital was not the priority .  \nB. The Public Market Can Adequately Meet ALLETE’s Reasonable Capital \nNeeds.  \nThe record demonstrates ALLETE’s claimed capital needs are overstated and can likely be \nmet by the public market.  \n \n129 Ex.

Assuming ALLETE’s  stated need for  $1 billion in equity over the \nnext five years  was accurate, that level of equity need would not be unprecedented.

The Public Market Likely Provides ALLETE with Reliable Access to \nCapital.  \n ALLETE asserts the deal  is necessary to preserve future  access  to capital  because the public \nmarket will not provide the necessary capital.  The size, customer base, and market disruption \nconcerns that ALLETE uses to justify its claim, however, are inconsistent with r ecord evidence. \nALLETE claims its size and high industrial customer concentration will limit its ability to \naccess capital. But ALLETE admits there are  no previous instances where  it was unable to access \ncapital from the public market when it needed to , given its  size and customer base.143 And the  \nclaim conflicts with past statements made to investors.

But investors \nrarely earn returns exceeding passive market benchmarks . Most active investors underperform the \nmarket. A S&P Global study, for example, found that more than 90% of actively managed U.S. \nequity funds have underperformed a passively managed benchmark during both the past ten years \nand the past three years.154 \n Becoming a private company will not help ALLETE access capital during a broad market \ndownturn.

T HE PROPOSED DEAL  WILL EXPOSE THE ENERGY TRANSITION , ALLETE,  AND \nRATEPAYERS TO HARM . \nThe Partners’ private messages  to internal committees and would -be investors establish \nsignificant risks. GIP and CPPIB  have no obligation to fund ALLETE’s 2040 energy transition. \nEven if the Partners do finance the transition, GIP and CPP IB will engage in risky private equity \ntactics  to achieve higher returns than available to  public investors.  \nA. The Partners W ill Only F inance ALLETE’s 2040 E nergy Transition If It Is \nthe Most Profitable Alternative.  \nPetitioners assert this deal will ensure funding for clean energy projects needed to serve \nALLETE’s rate -regulated customers. The record does not support  that claim. The Partners may \ndeploy their capital to pursue significant natural gas investments or non- regulated projects. And \neven absent adverse economic conditions, the Partners may decide, consistent with their own \ninvestor obligations, that other investments offer a superior risk- adjusted return. The Partners also \nmay lack capital for ALLETE, or the P artners may decide that delaying or maintaining fossil fuel \ninfrastructure offers a better return.  The proposed deal does not adequately address these risks.  \nWhile ALLETE suggests the deal will finance projects needed for its energy transition, \nPetitioners’ actions suggest they have other plans. Rather than decarbonizing, ALLETE’s recently filed integrated resource plan does not close the Boswell Energy Center, a fossil fuel power plant, and includes more than 1,000 MW of new natural gas capacity.\n166 ALLETE’s 2024 Form 10- K \nsimilarly includes $1.3 billion in spending on “Base & Other” generation for regulated operations, plus an additional $230 million on the 600 MW gas -fired Nemadji Trail Energy Center.\n167 \nPrivately, the Partners [NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . .   \n \n166 Ex.

ALLETE’s assumption that the Partners will fund its capital plan is inconsistent with basic \ninvestment principles . Although ALLETE’s chief financial officer acknowledged that  “investment \n101” dictates  the Partners’ willingness to invest additional capital in the future  depends on the \nalternatives , he expressed certainty  that the Partners would make capital available to ALLETE  \neven without a binding commitment .\n170 This confidence is misplaced . The Partners will have many \nalternatives. Because GIP Fund V is a fixed length fund, no new capital or investors  will be \nintroduced once it raises $25 billion.171 As a result, the Partners – as is common with private equity \nplays – will have limited ability to make new or follow -on investments in portfolio companies.172 \nThis situation may be far from ideal.  ALLETE, lacking a binding capital commitment,  will be \ncompet ing for a limited pool of  equity with other portfolio companies  that may offer a higher \nreturn . \n In addition, the Partners may have inadequate capital. Post -transaction , ALLETE will be \nsolely dependent on Alloy Parent, a holding company created by the Partners, for equity capital. \n \n168 Ex. OAG-412 at 26; Ex.

There also  \nare numerous utilities that have backtracked  coal-fired generation closure commitments in recent \nyears.179 In short, the risk that the Partners will backslide is plausible.  \n While Petitioners generally suggest the deal will provide ALLETE with capital to finance \nclean energy to serve Minnesota utility customers, the actual record presents a far riskier and \nuncertain outcome. Because the Partners will pursue their own financial interests, the Commission \ncannot be confident that the deal will provide capital to fund ALLETE’s energy transition. \nB. T he Partners A re Counting on R isky Financial and Operational E ngineering \nto Achieve H igher R eturns . \n Petitioners publicly suggest there are no material differences between public and private \nequity ownership, but the Partners ’ private communications show they are seeking significantly \nhigher returns. U nlike a diffuse pool of transient stock market investors, the Partners will have the \nmeans to engage in risky private equity tactics to achieve their anticipated returns. \n1. The Partners Are Counting on Returns That Significantly Exceed  the \nPublic Market.  \nPublicly, the Partners present mixed messages  on the return on equity they expect. Some \nALLETE witnesses suggest that the return should be equal to the return presently available to \npublic investors. The Partners, however, hint they are entitled to bigger returns.  \nPetitioner  witness Ms. Ann Bulkley testified that the cost of equity capital would be \nunchanged by the deal  because “the Company’s cost of equity should be evaluated in rate \nproceedings based on the risk of the investment, which has not changed.”180 The Partners’ \nrepresentatives, however, suggest they might be entitled to more under the Hope and Bluefield \n \n179 Ex.

At a minimum, they need to recover the \n$1.5 billion acquisition premium paid to acquire ALLETE’s shares.184 As CPP IB explained, \nprivate investments provide “superior risk-adjusted returns.”185 Ratepayers will ultimately bear the  \ncost of these returns.  \nPrivately, the Partners explain how much of a premium they expect : [NOT PUBLIC \nHCTS DATA BEGINS . . .   . . .

S&P Global, for \nexample, recently reported that there were 55 return -on-equity determinations by regulatory bodies \nfor electric utilities in 2024, ranging from 9.20% to 10.50%, with an average of 9.74%.187 The \nreturns sought by the Partners also greatly exceed credible estimates from respectable cost of \nequity sources  for average risk publicly traded companies, most of which are below 8 %.188 \n \n181 See, e.g., Ex.

T\nhe Partners’ Current Plans  Will Weaken ALLETE’s Financial Health and\nLead to Increased  Customer Bills.\nIf the Partners use risky strategies to inflate their returns, ALLETE and ratepayers  will \nultimately pay the associated bill.

I n a \nrecession or other adverse economic event, the consequences for ALLETE – now lacking financial \nwiggle room – could be significant. \nThe Commission should be concerned about Alloy Parent ’s debt outside of ALLETE’s \nregulated capital structure. Alloy Parent will own no assets or investments other than ALLETE. \nAs a result, ALLETE will ultimately pay interest and principal payments on Alloy Parent ’s and \nALLETE’s  debt.203 ALLETE’s regulated operations in Minnesota, which currently represent \nroughly 70% of the company, will ultimately be responsible for servicing most of this debt . If the \nincremental debt load becomes too large, or interest rates rise such that Alloy Parent or ALLETE have trouble refinancing the extra debt when it expires, Alloy Parent may try to extract cash from ALLETE to pay the incremental debt.\n204 \nWhile the Partners would be limited in how they could extract cash from ALLETE, they \ncould direct ALLETE to  incrementally  increase debt within  its regulated capital structure, cut \n203 Ex.

The Partners’ Proposed Governance Plan  Does  Not Adequately Protect the \nPublic I nterest.  \n Publicly, Petitioners assert that ALLETE’s existing management will maintain control over \nday-to-day operations , and development and execution of the 2040 energy transition strategy. The \nPartners’ governance plan, which is a secret to all but  a few of ALLETE’s senior management, \nsuggests otherwise. Troublingly, even senior ALLETE managers with access do not appear  to \nunderstand how the plan will give the Partners deep control over the utility’s operations. This level \nof control is out of step with other recent take- private transactions involving utilities.  \n1. ALLETE Would Lose Control Over Its Operations.  \n Largely secret term sheets addressing key governance provisions  show GIP and CPP IB \nwill exercise consent rights over almost all meaningful decision- making. Just as troubling as the \nterms themselves, ALLETE’s senior management does not appear to understand or is confused about the significant impact of the terms.  \nUnder the currently planned governance structure, ALLETE’s post -transaction board will \nhave two independent directors and eleven directors loyal to the Partners.

In the New Jersey matter, she identified  having a \nmajority of the board made up of independent directors as  “an important aspect of the . . . protective \ncommitments” made by transaction proponents.234 The same should be true for ALLETE.  \n Beyond conflicting with relevant precedent  and Ms. Lapson’s  prior testimony , the Partners’ \nopposition to greater board independence clashes with their comments that ALLETE’s existing \nmanagement is a transaction feature and that their interest s are fully aligned.235 If the Partners ’ \ninterests fully align with ALLETE’s interests, then any board comprised of competent directors overseeing ALLETE’s existing management will be sufficient.

Conflicts of interest could arise over proposed business relationships between \nthe utility and the Partners’ affiliates or appointed directors, over the proper priorities for allocating capital dollars between unregulated and regulated subsidiaries, or over placing an undue emphasis on near -term increases to utility earnings.\n236 Under the plan, there will be no check on the Partners’ \nability to engage in risk financial, operational, and governance engineer ing absent an independent \nboard with the ability to make final budgeting and debt issuance decision-making. T hese risks \nshould concern the Commission.  \nB. Petitioners  Have No  Plans to Comply with Minnesota’s A ffiliated -Interest \nLaw. \n Despite the plain language of Minnesota’s affiliated- interest statute, Petitioners propose \nonly to report contracts with affiliate s that exceed $1 million  based on vendor self -reporting.237 \nEven if this approach complied with state law, it would be inadequate to prevent conflicts of interest and cross subsidies between ALLETE and the Partners’ other portfolio companies.  State law provides that any person or corporation directly or indirectly holding at least 5% \nof the voting securities of a public utility is an affiliated interest. If that person or corporation also holds at least 5% of the voting securities of another c orporation, then an affiliated interest exists \nbetween th at corporation and the public utility too.\n238 When an affiliated interest exists, no contract \nor arrangement involving more than $50,000 is valid or effective until the  contract or arrangement \nhas received written Commission approval.239 The statute’s purpose is ensuring, in the absence of \n \n236 Ex.

Petitioners’ proposed approach does not comply with the statute. \nFirst, Petitioners plan to rely on self -reporting by contractual counterparties rather than \ninvestigating  whether the affiliated interest  exists . Second, they only plan to seek Commission \napproval for contracts worth $1 million or more instead of contracts worth more than $50,000.   Even if Petitioners’ approach did not contravene the statute’s plain language, it would be \ninadequate to prevent probable conflicts of interest and cross subsidies. CPPIB mentions, for \nexample, [NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA BEGINS . . .  \n . . . NOT PUBLIC HCTS DATA \nENDS] .\n243 It also is out of step with other recent take- private transactions. In the El Paso Electric \nproceeding, for example, J.P. Morgan made firm commitments to comply with affiliated interest statutes, rules, and regulations.\n244 Given the Partners’ extensive holdings, it will not be feasible for \nMinnesota regulators to track and police potential self -dealing and cross -subsidization without \nstatutory compliance. \n \n240 In re Minn.

Petitioners’  Proposed Ring-Fencing Provisions A re Inadequate to Protect \nRatepayers.  \n Attempting  to rebalance benefits and harms, Petitioners propose various ring- fencing \nmeasures that purport to protect the regulated utility from risks posed by parent or affiliate entities. \nWhile these provisions are largely reasonable, they are not sufficient  to protect  ALLETE’s \nregulated operations.  \nRing- fencing creates a virtual barrier that segregates a portion of a company’s financial \nassets from the rest. Ring -fencing measures  can insulate a regulated utility from the potentially \nriskier activities of both its unregulated affiliate s and parent entities .245 While the proposed \nmeasures to protect ALLETE from parent entity activities  are generally consistent with those \nbuyers have  offered  in other take -private transactions, the  proposed measures  omit key protections \noffered in other transactions. For example, the Partners  have not committed to obtaining a non-\nconsolidation legal opinion. A non- consolidation opinion would help prove that  ALLETE’s assets \nwould be protected in the event of a parent or affiliate bankruptcy. Although she discounts the value in this proceeding,\n246 Petitioner witness Ms. Lapson previously testified  that a  commitment \nto obtaining a  non- consolidation opinion was one of “the most important aspects” of the proposed \nprotective measures in a take- private transaction .247 She explained that the commitment assured  \nregulators that “an independent legal authority” would verify that proposed protections were \nproperly implemented, and also “provide [d] greater comfort to current and prospective lenders and \nrating agencies.”248 \n \n245 Ex.

DOC -315 at 23 (Lapson SJI Testimony). \n248 Id. at 24 . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n44 Petitioners also have not addressed  the lack of adequate ring-fencing protections between \nALLETE’s regulated and unregulated activities.249 While risks stemming from ALLETE’s \nunregulated operations exist today, the potential for unregulated investments to surge post -\ntransaction heightens those risks. A s those risks increase, ALLETE’s retail customers  would pay \nhigher rates arising from increased utility debt costs.250 \nIn sum, the governance, affiliated interest, and ring- fencing commitments  currently \nproposed by Petitioners are inadequate to balance out the deal’s foreseeable net harm.  \n  CONCLUSION \n Petitioners’ deal, as proposed, will not provide ALLETE reliable capital access . The \nPartners’ private messages and memoranda establish that this deal presents far more risk than \nPetitioners publicly acknowledge. Approving this deal will  jeopardize ALLETE’s 2040 energy \ntransition , the company’s long- term financial health, and the quality and affordability of retail \nservice. Given the balance of benefits and harm, the deal is not consistent with the public interest. The Commission should not approve it as currently proposed.

That company, Duluth- based \nMinnesota Power, would have the Commission believe that the proposed acquisition won’t change \nthe way Minnesota Power does business, its commitments to its employees, or the Commission’s oversight.  But private equity  investors don’t pay $3.9 billion and expect to get nothing in return.  \nRather, the record in this case demonstrates that Minnesota Power’s prospective acquirers plan to achieve the outsized returns th at characterize private equity by controlling the board of directors , \nraising rates, taking on debt, and reselling Minnesota Power at a profit.   \nMinnesota law recognizes that well -functioning utilities  and affordable rates  are a public \ngood and requires the Commission to review acquisitions  like this  to ensure that they are consistent \nwith the public interest.  The  prospective acquirers’ plans hold risks for Minnesota Power’s \nratepayers, the energy transition, and effective Commission oversight of the utility.  And, while the acquisition would greatly benefit ALLETE ’s shareholders and executives, the potential public \nbenefits of a sale appear  marginal or illusory.  The ALJ and the Commission should find that the \nrisk of giving over control of Minnesota Power to private interests outweighs any potential benefit, and that the proposed acquisition is therefore not consistent with the public inter est. \nBACKGROUND \nI. T\nHE PETITIONERS  \nOn July 19, 2024, ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power filed a petition under Minn. Stat. \n§ 216B.50, seeking Commission approval to engage in a merger  whereby entities controlled or \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n2 managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board \n(CPP) would acquire all outstanding shares of ALLETE.1 \nALLETE is a diversified energy company based in Duluth.2  ALLETE’s largest business \nunit is Minnesota Power, a regulated utility with the exclusive right to provide retail electric service to approximately 150,000 customers in a 26,000-square- mile service territory in northern \nMinnesota.\n3  Large industrial customers, such as taconite mines and wood- products manufacturers, \nprovide more than  70 percent of Minnesota Power’s retail sales.4  ALLETE, or its corporate \npredecessor  Minnesota Power and Light , has been  publicly traded on the New York Stock \nExchange since 1950.5 \nGIP is the trading name of the private equity firm Global Infrastructure Management, \nLLC.6  GIP specializes in investing  in, owning, and/or operating energy, transport, digital \ninfrastructure, water, and wastewater companies.7  As of March 2024, GIP had more than  $100 \nbillion in assets under management.8  In October 2024, GIP was acquired by BlackRock, Inc., the \nworld’s largest asset manager, which controls more than $11 trillion in assets.9 \nCPP manages Canada Pension Plan funds in the best interest s of 22 million participating \ncontributors and beneficiaries .10  As of March 2024, nearly $200 billion, or 42 percent of CPP’s \n \n1 Ex.

IN EARLY 2023,  ALLETE  DECIDES TO PURSUE A PRIVATE EQUITY  BUYOUT  TO \nMAXIMIZE VALUE TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS . \nALLETE’s board  of directors  regularly  evaluates acquisition  and buyout  opportunities that \ncould maximize value to shareholders and  other stakeholders.12  In October 2022 and again in \nMarch 2023, the board met with representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss ways to maximize value, \nincluding a potential sale to a privately held company.13   \nJ.P.

Morgan’s  search process \nfocused on pension and infrastructure funds because they “could provide increased access to \ncapital to enhance infrastructure investment as well as fast -track key growth strategies, express a \ncommitment for a long -term hold and make commitments in regulatory processes.”23 \n \n22 Ex.

ALLETE’ S DEMAND FOR A HIGH ACQUISITION PREMIUM FORCES SEVERAL \nPOTENTIAL BUYERS TO DROP OUT OF THE BIDDING PROCESS . \nUpon outreach by J.P. Morgan, GIP , CPP,  and four other parties expressed interest in \npotentially acquiring a company with ALLETE’s characteristics.24  By early September, however, \nthe parties  other than GIP and CPP  had dropped out of the process because they could not offer \nthe kind of premium over market that ALLETE was looking for.25   \nAt this point, GIP and CPP were not yet working together as partners because J.P. Morgan \nwas carefully controlling the confidentiality of the process ; it would not introduce the  two investors  \nuntil late December.26   \nOn September 7 , GIP submitted a nonbinding offer of $71 per share, indicating that  it could \nfund at least 50  percent itself  but would likely need to partner with other investors to fully fund \nthe purchase.27  A few days later , CPP submitted a nonbinding offer of $69.26 per share.28   \nFollowing their initial offers, GIP and CPP continued to conduct due -diligence efforts with \nthe assistance of ALLETE’s management.29  In October, ALLETE set a December deadline  for \nthe prospective buyers  to submit binding proposals, but later pushed the deadline back to January \n2024 after b oth GIP and CPP requested more time to facilitate “equity consortium partnering \ndiscussions” with other investors.30   \nOn Nov ember 1,  Minnesota P ower  filed a rate case seeking $90 million in new annual \nrevenue, a 12 percent net increase over then -current rates .31 \n \n24 Ex.

Morgan introduced representatives of GIP  and CPP to allow them \nto discuss pursuing an acquisition as partners.34  GIP and CPP  (the Partners)  initially decided to \npursue an acquisition as a 50/50 partnership.35 \nOn February 1, 2024, the Partners  offered  to purchase ALLETE for  $62.50 per share.36  \nALLETE rejected the offer  the next day.37  \nThree days later,  the Partners  submitted an updated written offer  for $64 per share , \nindicating  that it was their  “best and final” offer.38 \nAt a February 7 special meeting, ALLETE’s board discussed  the Partners’ updated offer \nwith a particular focus on the  transaction premium and adjustments that the Partners had made to \nALLETE’s valuation.39  The board directed J.P. Morgan to tell the Partners that the updated offer \nstill did not reflect a sufficient valuation .40  The board also expressed an interest in further \ndiscussing with management  a plan for self -financing its capital needs , while temporarily pausing \nengagement with the Partners.41   \n \n32 Ex.

AFTER REJECTING THE PARTNERS ’ FIRST TWO OFFERS , ALLETE’ S BOARD PREPARES \nTO PROCEED WITH A STANDALONE FINANCING PLAN. \nTwo days later, the board held a special meeting to review ALLETE’s standalone financing  \nplan—also known as the “Within Financing Limits Plan”44—under which ALLETE could raise \ncapital  without going private.45  According to company management , ALLETE could feasibly \nraise several hundred million dollars of annual equity financing under this plan46 while [HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]   \n \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS]47   Doing so would, however, \nrequire [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]    \n  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS]\n48  \nAdditionally, [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]    \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS]  \n \n42 Ex.

ALLETE  AGREES TO THE PARTNERS ’ THIRD OFFER OF $67  PER SHARE AND \nNEGOTIATES ADDITIONAL DEAL TERMS . \nAfter ALLETE rejected their second offer, CPP and GIP had continued to conduct due \ndiligence with the support of ALLETE’s  management .51  On March 30, the Partners  made a third \noffer to buy ALLETE, this time for  $67 per share ,52 or a 22 percent premium over ALLETE’s 30 -\nday volume -weighted average price prior to the initial publication of the rumor that ALLETE was \nexploring a sale.53   \n \n49 Ex.

AFTER SETTLING MINNESOTA POWER ’S RATE CASE, ALLETE  PUBLICLY REVEALS \nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT . \nOn Friday May 3, 2024, ALLETE filed with the Commission a settlement agreement fully \nresolv ing Minnesota Power’s pending rate case.57 \nOver th e weekend , ALLETE officially accepted the terms of a deal under which the \nPartners  would indirectly acquire all its shares through ALLETE’s merger with a Partner -owned \nsubsidiary (the merger agreement).58 \nOn Monday morning, ALLETE announced the merger agreement before market open via \na joint press release with the Partners. 59  ALLETE then began executing its outreach plan to \n“communicate the benefits of the transaction” to affected stakeholders.60 \nVII. PROPOSED ACQUISITION STRUCTURE AND COMMITMENTS  \nThe proposed acquisition is structured as a merger whereby ALLETE would merge into \nAlloy Merger Sub LLC, with ALLETE as the surviving entity.61  Through this merger, ALLETE \n \n54 Ex.

THE PARTNERS ’ PLANS FOR ALLETE  ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INVESTMENT \nSTRATEGIES OF PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTORS IN GENERAL . \nLike typical  private equity investors, the Partners do not seek to passively invest in target \ncompanies.  Instead, t he Partners’ stated plans for ALLETE reflect  common private equity \nstrategies, including governance control, the use of debt to boost returns, and strategic sales. \nA. Private Equity  Investors Generally  Seek to Acquire Controlling Interests that \nGive Them  Influence  Over a Target’s Operations and Finances with the Goal \nof Maximizing Their Return Upon Exit.  \nPrivate equity firms are investment managers that raise capital , typically from institutional \ninvestors such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, and \nwealthy individuals, and then use that capital, often along with substantial amounts of debt, to acquire companies or other assets .\n72  Private equity investors, commonly referred to as “limited \npartners,” invest by contributing capital to funds established by private equity firms.73  While \nlimited partners provide most of the capital, it is the “general partner” —an entity controlled, \nowned, or managed by the private equity firm —that selects a fund’s investments.74  In this case, \nGIP and CPP plan to share control of Alloy Holdings GP LLC, the general partner of the Alloy \ngroup of companies.75 \nSuccessful private equity investing relies on careful evaluation of investments, structuring \nof deals, financial engineering , and operational engineering.76   Unlike investors in public \n \n70 See Ex.

A strategic buyer can help a company open up an \nexpanded customer base; on the downside, however, this type of  acquisition can lead to culture \nclashes or layoffs.86  A financial buyer can  bring dealmaking experience but, on the downside, \nmay emphasize aggressive performance targets and introduce excessive leverage.87  Finally, an \nIPO allows access to vast pools of capital but tends to be an expensive process and leads to \nincreased disclosures and scrutiny.88 \nB. The Partners ’ Plan s for ALLETE  Include  Taking on  Debt, Us ing Control of \nALLETE’s Board to Increase the Company’s Value, and Ultimately to Exit by \nSelling ALLETE for a Profit . \nMost  of the strategies used by private equity investors in general, such as increasing sales, \ncutting expenses, adding leverage, and exercising board control, c an also be appl ied to a privately \nowned utility.89  The  Partners plan to use typical private equity strategies if they are allowed to \nacquire ALLETE. \nLike private equity investors generally, the Partners plan  to use significant amounts of debt.  \nThe Partners’ leveraging strategy is not described in any detail in the petition  or testimony , which \ndiscusses $300 million in new debt that would be used to fund the initial purchase of ALLETE.90  \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]   \n    \n \n86 Ex.

First, the acquisition would expose ratepayers to the risk \nthat rates would increase unsustainably, as well as the risk that Minnesota Power’s service quality \ncould be impaired in the long run.  Second, the acquisition poses risks to the energy transition due to uncertainties about the Partners’ future priorities.  Third, the acquisition would impair  regulatory \noversight by giving control of ALLETE to new owners, reducing transparency, and making regulati ng affiliated interests more difficult.  Finally, the potential benefits of the proposed \nacquisition are marginal and insufficient to offset its many risks.  \nI. T\nHE PROPOSED ACQUISITION HOLDS RISKS FOR RATEPAYER S. \nThe proposed acquisition holds substantial risks for ratepayers.  First, the rate increases on \nwhich the transaction is premised are unsustainable.  Second, the Partners plan to increase the amount of debt in ALLETE’s corporate hierarchy, which will intensify the risk of rate increases because it will tend to increase ALLETE and Minnesota Power’s borrowing costs.  Third , the cost -\ncutting and use of leverage that is prevalent among  private equity investors, as well as ALLETE’s \ndependence on two investors, creates risks that its service quality may suffer over the long term.   \n \n113 ORDER REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND GRANTING INTERVENTION , AND NOTICE OF \nAND ORDER FOR HEARING  at 8 (Oct. 7, 2024). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n21 A. The Proposed Acquisition Would Increase the Risk of Un affordabl e Rate \nHikes.   \nIf approved , GIP and CPP’s proposal to acquire ALLETE would magnify the risk that \nMinnesota Power’s rates will rise at an unsustainable rate.   First, by negotiating for a substantial \npremium over ALLETE’s market price, ALLETE materially increased Partners’ incentive to raise  \nrates.  Second, the record contains indications of Partners’ intent to do just that. \nIn negotiating the deal, ALLETE insisted on receiving a substantial premium to its market \nvalue, rejecting an initial offer of $62.50 per share and a second offer of $64 per share before \naccepting a third offer of $67 per share .114  The last  price reflect s a premium of $1.5 billion over \nALLETE’s book value .115  This premium  materially increases the risk of unsustainable rate hike s \nin the future  because the Partners w ould be incentivized to seek increases to  Minnesota Power’s \nROE and/or grow its rate base substantially  to rec oup the premium.116   \nWhile  Minnesota Power has stated that it will not attempt to recover the acquisition \npremium from utility customers ,117 this appears to simply be an assurance that the utility  will not  \ninclude the premium as a line item in a future rate case.   This commitment does not fully  mitigate \nthe risk  of substantial future rate increases motivated by the acquisition premium.118    \nIf the acquisition goes through, t he Partners w ill have the means  to influence Minnesota \nPower’s rate -case strategy  through their  control of ALLETE’s board.

This is true even though the Commission will retain authority \nover Minnesota Power’s rates, as discussed in greater detail below.  \nB. The Increased Leverage that the Partners Are Planning Would Compound \nRate -Increase Risks . \nAnother way that the proposed acquisition creates risks to rates is through its potential to \nincrease ALLETE’s cost of debt.\n129  As discussed above, private equity investors like the Partners \ngenerally seek higher investment returns in part by implementing changes in an acquired company’s financial structure.\n130  This may include a significant increase in the amount of debt \nfinancing, which can raise the acquired company’s cost of capital.131  Because of how cost of \nequity is estimated in utility rate cases, the Commission will likely be able to mitigate the effects of potential increases in Minnesota Power’s cost of equity.\n132  Potential increases to Minnesota \nPower’s cost of debt, however, will be much harder to identify, measure, and adjust for.133 \n \n125 Ex.

The risk of increased debt costs is a longer -term risk that \nALLETE and the Partners have failed to mitigate against.  \nC. The Proposed A cquisition Hold s Risks for S ervice Quality. \nThe Partners’ proposed acquisition of ALLETE creates risks to Minnesota Power’s service \nquality in three ways.  First, the cost -cutting that private equity investors use to boost their returns \nposes a risk to reliable service over the long term.  Second, Partners’ planned use of debt to finance \ncapital infusions materially increases the risk that ALLETE will experience financial distress or cash-flow problems in the future.  And, finally, ALLETE’s dependence on just two sources of \ncapital, GIP and CPP, mean s that the Partners could decide that their money is better spent \nelsewhere, leaving ALLETE without access to equity capital . \nPrivate equity investors engage in operational engineering to increase revenue and \nprofits ,\n143 including through cost -cutting.  GIP, for example, uses  cost-cutting measures such as \n[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]   \n [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA \nENDS]144  The Partners have stated that they do not expect significant reduced costs in the near  \nfuture  as a result of the acquisition .145  They have also made certain commitments to maintain the \npositions , compensation, and benefits of nonunion employees and to extend certain union contracts  \nin the near term .146  These commitments , however, are limited in duration  and allow  for future \n \n142 Ex.

But even short of bankruptcy or  a forced \nsale, financial pressure to service increased debt obligations could negatively impact service \nquality for Minnesota Power’s ratepayers. \nFinally, if the acquisition were approved, there  would be  a risk that Partners eventually \ndecide their money is better invested  elsewhere  and allocat e capital away from ALLETE .151  \nDepriving ALLETE of capital is contrary to  the purpose of the acquisition , and the OAG does not \ndoubt that Partners would prefer to invest profitably in ALLETE and Minnesota Power.  However, \nas discussed in more detail later, the Partners have been careful to avoid any binding commitments \nto meet ALLETE’s capital needs.152  They have also been unwilling to commit not to impose \nconditions on capital infusions.153   \n \n147 Ex.

OAG-400 at 26 (Lebens Direct). \n152 In rebuttal testimony, Alloy Parent committed to fund Minnesota Power’s five -year capital plan  \nwith certain caveats .  For reasons discussed later, the strength of this commitment is at best unclear.  \nSee Ex. OAG-402 at 4 (Lebens Surrebuttal).   \n153 See Ex. OAG-407 at 1–2.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n27 The Partners  have also been very clear  that “individual investment decisions for Minnesota \nPower will continue to be made based on an assessment of the risk of the given investment and the \nexpectation of the return required for and available from that investment .”154   If the Partners \nbecome dissatisfied with Minnesota Power or ALLETE’s returns, there is a risk  that they could \nunderfund ALLETE with or without  continuing to extract cash.   While this risk may appear remote, \neven risks that have a relatively small chance of occurring are something the Commission should \ngive weight to, especially if the magnitude of the potential harm is  great.  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the proposed acquisition poses material risks for Minnesota \nPower’s ratepayers that ALLETE and the Partners have failed to mitigate.  \nII. THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION HOLDS RISKS FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION . \nA stated purpose of the proposed acquisition is to provide Minnesota Power with  access to \ncapital that will help it execute the energy trans ition.155  Paradoxically, because of risks related to \nthe Partners’  priorities and  potential exit strategy , the acquisition may end up impairing Minnesota \nPower’s ability to comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard (CFS).   \nThe CFS requires an electric utility to generate or procure 100 percent of its sales to \nMinnesota retail customers from carbon -free energy technologies by 2040.156  The statute also sets \nintermediate goals of 80 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2035.157  Minnesota Power currently \nplans to meet these goals in part by ceasing coal-fired  generation at Boswell Energy Center Unit  3 \nby December 31, 2029, and at Boswell Unit 4 by 2035.158   \n \n154 Ex.

Sierra -1100 at 33 (Lane Direct) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n28 There is a risk that Minnesota Power could seek to postpone Boswell 3 and 4’s cease -coal \ndates after ALLETE is under new ownership.159  There is already a risk that Minnesota Power’s \nplans could change  without new ownership.160  However, t he risk of Minnesota Power extending \nthe operation of its coal fleet  is greater under private ownership because private firms tend to hold \nonto coal assets longer than publicly traded utilities, who are subject to pressure from activist \nshareholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.161   \nWhile the Partners claim to support Minnesota Power’s planned transition to clean energy \nsources, there is no guarantee that they w ould not seek to change its  planned coal -retirement dates \nif the acquisition i s approved.162  The Partners have not committed to following Minnesota Power’s \nannounced coal retirement schedule for the Boswell units ,163 and their commitment to fund \nALLETE’s five -year capital plan only extends to 2029, which is before Boswell’s current cease -\ncoal date.164  The lack of a firm commitment is concerning because priorities can change165 and \nthe Partners have been clear that their future investment decisions will be made “based on an \nassessment of the risk of the given investment and the expectation of the return required for and available from that investment,”\n166 not necessarily  based on Minnesota Power’s current goals.   \nThe risk of evolving capital -spending priorities  is illustrated by Minnesota Power’s \nrecently filed 2025–2039 integrated resource plan (IRP).  In the IRP, Minnesota Power proposes a resource mix that includes far more new natural gas resources than new renewable energy \n \n159 Ex. Sierra -1100 at 37 (Lane Direct) . \n160 See Ex. Sierra -1100 at 37–42 (Lane Direct) (providing several examples of utilities changing \nthe date of planned fossil- fuel plant retirements).  \n161 Ex. Sierra -1100 at 42 (Lane Direct) . \n162 Ex.

MP -14 at 25 (Bram Direct).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n29 resources .167  The IRP’s emphasis on fossil fuels undermines the idea that the proposed acquisition \nis being driven primarily by a need for capital investment in clean and renewable energy \nresources.168 \nEven if the Partners remain fully committed to Minnesota Power’s clean -energy goals \nthroughout their ownership of ALLETE, they  have not committed to hold ALLETE for any \nparticular period of time.169  The Partners could therefore exit and sell their shares prior to \nMinnesota Power ceasing  coal generation, and there is no guarantee that the next owners of \nALLETE will support those plans.170  While  a future owner ’s priorities are unknowable, it is likely \nthat whoever buys ALLETE from the Partners would seek to control its  budgets and business \nplans, just as the Partners have done.171   \nIt is true that the Commission would need to approve any future sale of ALLETE .  But a \nproposed sale could present the Commission with a dilemma in which there is no good outcome.  In a future sale proceeding, the Commission could be  forced to decide between denying the sale \nand being left with the status quo—ownership by investors who are no longer interested in owning \nALLETE—or approving the sale to a prospective owner who  may not be supportive of ALLETE’s \ntransition to clean energy.\n172  There would be nothing the Commission c ould do in this situation \nto force  the Partners to continue providing equity c apital to ALLETE, even though ALLETE would \nbe fully dependent on the Partners for external  equity capital.173   \n \n167 Ex.

In lieu of generating or procuring energy directly to satisfy the standard, a utility \ncan use renewable energy credits to comply.174  The Commission is in the process of determining \nhow utilities will have to comply the Standard, and a decision is not anticipated until the end of \nthe year.175  Given the many uncertainties around how the CFS  will be implemented and Minnesota \nPower ’s various compliance options , nothing short of a binding commitment from the Partners can \nguarantee that the current schedule will hold.176 \nIII. THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION THREATENS EFFECTIVE  REGULATORY OVERSIGHT . \nThe Petitioners argue that the proposed acquisition would not change the Commission’s \nauthority over Minnesota Power .177  But t here are at least three ways in which the acquisition  \nwould threaten effective regulatory oversight if approved.  First, effective regulation depends to a large degree on the cooperation of utilities.  In a change -of-control acquisition like this one, it \nmatters who the acquirer is, and there are indications that the Partners could prove to be less- than\n-\ncooperative owners.  Second, the acquisition threatens effective regulation through the loss of the comprehensive reporting regime imposed on publicly traded companies by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  F inally, the Partners’ extensive holdings  would make policing conflicts \nof interest much more difficult for the Commission and other stakeholders. \nA. Minnesota Power, Under the Partners ’ Control,  Would Be Less Transparent \nand Likely Less Cooperative, Impeding Effective Oversight . \nA key theme of the Petitioners in this case has been that the acquisition is consistent with \nthe public interest because Minnesota Power would remain subject to Commission oversight and \n \n174 Ex. Sierra -1100 at 40 (Lane Direct) (citing Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 4(b) ). \n175 Ex. Sierra -1100 at 40 (Lane Direct) . \n176 Ex. Sierra -1100 at 40 (Lane Direct) . \n177 See, e.g., Ex.

MP-33 at 46 (Bram Rebuttal).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n31 regulation.178  But the Petitioners paint far too simplistic a picture : the Commission does not make \ndecisions in a vacuum.179  Minnesota Power controls, to a great degree, the information that the \nCommission review s in making its decisions.180  If the acquisition is approved, the Partners would \nbe in a position to influence Minnesota Power’s regulatory filings and advocacy.  And t here are \nindications that Minnesota Power would be less transparent under the control of the Partners, \nmaking the Commission’s oversight more difficult. \nIf the proposed acquisition is approved, the Partners will control ALLETE’s board.  While \nthe Partners may not be directly involved in Minnesota Power ’s daily operational decisions, the \nboard will  guide ALLETE and Minnesota Power’s  day-to-day operations and approve their \nbudgets and strategic plans.181  “When asked in discovery if the Partners would commit to never \ninfluencing ALLETE Board decisions regarding who should be on Minnesota Power’s management team, the Partners did not answer.”\n182  Partners and ALLETE also have not \ncommitted to having the majority of the ALLETE board member s be independent of the Partners \nand any affiliate.183  On the contrary, only 3 out of 13 board members will be independent of the \nPartners,184 and [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]   \n \n178 See, e.g., Ex. MP -14 at 43  (Bram Rebuttal)  (“[W] ith Minnesota Power remaining subject to \nCommission regulation, [ALLETE’s]   strategies will continue to be directed at satisfying \nCommission directives  and Minnesota Power’s obligations to provide safe and reliable utility \nservice, the cost of which will remain subject to Commission regulation. ”), 46 (“[T]here will be \nno change to the Commission’s regulatory oversight as a result of this  governance structure. . . . \nAfter the Acquisition, the Company will be regulated as it always has been , with the Commission \nhaving regulatory authority over rates and service quality.”).  \n179 Tr. vol. 1 at 120 (Cady). \n180 See Ex.

MP-27, sched. 1 at 2 (Cady Rebuttal). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n32  [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE \nSECRET DATA ENDS]185  \nThe Partners’ control of ALLETE would allow them to shape regulation.  Sierra Club \nwitness Lane used  the example of an IRP proceeding to illustrate how a utility  sets the information \nframe for Commission decisions.  If the IRP that a utility presents to the Commission is biased \ntoward capital investments over operating expenses , “the Commission can try to mitigate this bias \nby disallowing certain aspects of the IRP, but it cannot craft a new resource plan without utility \ncooperation.”186  Similarly, while other parties can review and comment on a utility’s IRP \nproposal, the utility will always have the most technical knowledge and information, a \nphenomenon known as “information asymmetry.”187  In sum, although the Commission has \nauthority to approve, reject or modify IRPs, it faces a disadvantage in trying to vet the prudence \nof a utility’s investment decisions.188 \nThe proposed acquisition  would not change the Commission’s authority  over Minnesota \nPower, but as the foregoing discussion demonstrates, this is  largely  beside the point.  The ease of \nregulating a utility is highly dependent on its  willingness to cooperate and work collaboratively \nwith the Commission and other stakeholders.  And some of the litigation tactics employed in this \nproceeding suggest that the ease of regulating ALLETE could be adversely affected by the \nacquisition .   \nFor example, after insisting on a special “highly confidential” classification for certain \ntrade- secret data  in this case , viewable by only a subset of party representatives, the Partners \n \n185 See Ex. MP-42, sched. 1 at 2–3 (Bram Surrebuttal).  \n186 Ex. Sierra -1102 at 10  (Lane Surrebuttal) . \n187 Ex. Sierra -1102 at 10 –11 (Lane Surrebuttal) . \n188 Ex.

Th e Partners’  effort \nto keep information from parties and the Commission, which is outside the norm for Minnesota \nutility regulation, illustrates the risk that regulating Minnesota Power will become more \nburdensome if the Commission allows the Partners to control it.    \nB. Going Private Would Diminish Transparency . \nGoing from a public ly held  company to a private ly held  one would materially decrease the \navailability and reliability of information about ALLETE’s various business es.  This would occur \nbecause, as a publicly traded company, ALLETE  is currently subject to  comprehensive reporting \nrequirements set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).192   \nSEC report s, such as Form 10- Qs and 10-Ks, along with associated disclosures like \nearnings call transcripts and investor presentations, currently provide a comprehensive view of \nALLETE’ s overall financial performance and strategic direction.193  The r equired disclosures , \nwhich include  consolidated financial statements, management’s discussion and analysis, risk \nfactors, and forward -looking statements , help regulators and other stakeholders understand \n \n189 See Order on Motion to Compel (Mar. 18, 2025) (ordering certain improper redactions removed \nfrom documents provided in response to DOC IRs 0013 and 0060). \n190 See Department Motion to Compel Discovery, Declaration of Katherine Arnold ¶¶ 3–16 ( Feb. \n13, 2025) (detailing Department’s efforts to have Partners remove improper redactions from \ndocuments attached to the response to DOC IRs 0013 and 0060  and provide a  proper privilege \nlog). \n191 See Order on Motion to Compel (Mar. 18, 2025)  (ordering certain improper redactions removed \nfrom documents provided in response to DOC IRs 0013 and 0060). \n192 Ex.

Morgan, and Wells Fargo.198  This level of outside analysis is unlikely to \ncontinue if ALLETE is taken private.199  Moreover, the information that ALLETE is offering to \nprovide pertains only to ALLETE and Alloy Parent.   ALLETE would be under no obligation to \nprovide , and is not committing to provide, any financial information about its new parents, GIP \nand CPP , or their broader portfolios.200  GIP and CPP’s portfolios are likely to be riskier  than \nMinnesota Power, and th eir risk could impact  the utility.201  This present s a significant “known \nunknown” for the Commission if the acquisition occurs. \n \n194 Ex.

The Proposed A cquisition Would Make It More D ifficult to P olice Self-\nDealing. \nPolicing self -dealing between utilities and their affiliates is an important purpose of \nregulation.  When utilities procure products or services, they have  a natural incentive to award \ncontracts to affiliate d businesses  even if alternative providers  would be more competitive.  This \ntype of self -dealing can result in a utility pass ing along above -market costs to ratepayers .202  Since \nutility  customers  cannot “take their business elsewhere” if self -dealing drives up their rates, they \nrely on the Commission to review  affiliated -interest agreements for reasonableness under \nMinnesota Statutes  section  216B.48. \nIf the Commission approves the proposed acquisition, ALLETE will become affiliated with \nthe vast network of companies contained in the Partners’ portfolios.203  GIP manages more than \n$100 billion in assets worldwide, while CPP manages nearly $200 billion in assets in the United \nStates alone.204  GIP, moreover, is a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, which manages over \n$11 trillion in assets worldwide.205  The existence of  hundreds if not thousands of new affiliates  \nwould magnify the risk that above -market costs will be passed on to ratepayers because of  \ncontracts that are not negotiated at arm’s length.206  While the Commission would have oversight \nof these transactions, the proposed acquisition will make this oversight more difficult for two \nreasons.  The first reason is the sheer number of opportunities that will exist for self -dealing .  The \nsecond is Partners’ lack of commitment to report self -dealing contracts as required by statute.  \nFirst, although it is unknown how many contracts  ALLETE or Minnesota Power might \nmake in the future  with BlackRock, GIP, or CPP affiliates, the opportunities would be many due \n \n202 Ex.

The statute requires Commission \nreview of any contract with a value greater than $50,000 between a public utility and an “affiliated \ninterest.”213  The definition of “affiliated interest” is broad.  It includes not only “ every corporation \nand person owning or holding directly or indirectly five percent or more of the voting securities of [a] public utility ” but also “every corporation five percent or more of whose voting securities is \nowned by any person or corporation owning five percent or more of the voting securities of such public utility .”\n214 \nALLETE initially proposed continuing, post -acquisition, what it described as the \nCommission’s “historical approach” to regulating affiliated interests.215   According to ALLETE, \nthe historical approach involves filing contracts between Minnesota Power and subsidiaries of ALLETE, as well as filing an annual report that lists ALLETE shareholders that own greater than five percent of the outstanding shares of its  stock.\n216   \nIn rebuttal testimony, ALLETE and the Partners  make two additional commitments :  First, \nthey would require Minnesota Power’s suppliers and industrial customers with contracted rates to identify whether they are more than five percent  owned by CPP, GIP, or Blackrock  and list those \nentities in its  annual report.  Second, they would  identify any contracts over $1 million with an \nentity identified  under the first commitment and notify the Commission within 30 days of \nexecution , certif ying that the contract was negotiated at arm ’s length.\n217 \n \ninfluencing the business decisions of affiliated companies.

For example, the statute sets a $50,000 monetary \nthreshold for Commission approval,218 while Minnesota Power’s self -declared  reporting threshold \nis 20 times higher —$1 million.  Moreover, Minnesota Power’s proposal does not commit to \ndisclosing contracts with all entities that meet the statutory definition of “affiliated interest.” \nMinnesota Power’s position on affiliated- interest compliance is “ oddly out of step with \nother recent take- private transactions ,” in which utilities or their acquirers had “made firm \ncommitments to comply with affiliated interest statutes, rules, and regulations .”219  ALLETE and \nthe Partners ’ failure  to simply commit to comply with t he law, as utilities in similar situations have \ndone, ought to give the Commission pause .  This failure likely means one of two things: i t either \n(1) tells the Commission  about the degree of cooperation the Partners are likely to exhibit post -\nacquisition or (2) demonstrates that Partners’ affiliates are so numerous that regulating their \nrelations with Minnesota Power in accordance with Minnesota law is infeasible.  Regardless, it is neither advisable nor consistent  with the law for the Commission to accept  a commitment that \namounts to less than full compl iance with the affiliated -interest statute .  \nIV. T\nHE PROPOSED ACQUISITION ’S BENEFITS ARE MARGINAL OR ILLUSORY . \nIn contrast to the many serious risks posed by the acquisition, its potential benefits are \nlimited.   The premise for  the acquisition is to provide ALLETE and Minnesota Power improved \naccess to capital .  But it is far from clear that the acquisition would improve ALLETE’s access to \ncapital .  ALLETE currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange, where it has access to vast \npools of capital.  Moreover, the Petitioners’ claim that the  public market is inadequate is  based on \nthe size of ALLETE’s capital need, but there are multiple avenues to mitigate that need.  Third, \n \n218 Minn. Stat. § 216B.48, subd. 4. \n219 Ex. DOC -301 at 13 (Vavro Direct). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n39 the Petitioners offer few tangible ratepayer benefits .  And finally, the Petitioners’  numerous \n“commitments” and “affirmations” are largely illusory : most simply attempt to mitigate the risks \nof the acquisition by promising to maintain the status quo. \nA. Whether the Proposed Acquisition Will Improve ALLETE’s Access to Capital \nIs Unclear.  \nAccording to the ALLETE, the primary goal of becoming a private company is to enable \nMinnesota Power to obtain a reliable source for additional capital to continue investing in clean \nenergy.220  Per ALLETE, t his will allow it to avoid the volatility associated with seeking significant \nfinancing on the public market, while gaining owners that “have an ability to exercise more \npatience with respect to quarterly earnings and dividends .”221  But t here is little hard evidence that \nthe proposed acquisition will improve ALLETE’s access to capital —and some evidence that the \nacquisition may impair it.   \nThe Petitioners  claim  that the a cquisition is the best way to obtain the capital th at ALLETE \nneeds  going forward,222  but they cite no instance where ALLETE or Minnesota Power was  unable \nto obtain necessary capital in the public market.223  Indeed, a major reason that companies seek to \nbecome publicly traded is “to raise capital and potentially broaden opportunities for future access to capital.”\n224  ALLETE assert s that the public market will n o longer meet its  capital needs  because \nALLETE’s stated capital need  is large  relative to its  market capitalization225 but provides n o \nquantitative analysis of the difficulty  or risk  of financing ALLETE’s capital needs in the public \n \n220 Ex.

Vol. 1 at 286–293 (Taran) (conceding lack of quantitative analysis in testimony or \nschedules).  \n227 Ex. OAG-404 at 15. \n228 See Tr. vol. 1 at 232 (Scissons) (conceding that ALLETE did not initially ask for this \ncommitment).  \n229 See supra pp. 6–10. \n230 See Tr. vol. 1 at 231– 32 (Scissons) (stating that Partners made the commitment after the \nintervenors filed their direct testimony and disclaiming knowledge of whether the commitment was ALLETE’s idea or Partners’ idea).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n41 Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan reflected in its February 2025 10- K filing, \nsubject to prospective reasonable and prudent plan adjustments.231 \nThere are several reasons this commitmen t is inadequate to meet its stated purpose of  \n“alleviat [ing] concerns about the availability of investment funds”  post-acquisition.  First, the \ncommitment is by Alloy Parent, not the Partners .  And w hile the Partners would have an indirect \nownership interest in Alloy Parent, they have not committed to hold that interest for any period,232 \nnor has Alloy Parent committed to hold ALLETE for any period. \nSecond, a five -year commitment is not sufficient to fund Minnesota Power’s efforts to \nachieve the energy transition.  At the hearing, ALLETE conceded that it will require additional \ncapital beyond its five -year plan to meet the CFS, yet ALLETE did not seek or obtain any \ncommitment to fund its needs beyond the next five years.233 \nAdditionally , Alloy Parent does not commit to provid e any new equity; if it chose, it c ould \nsimply reinvest dividends rather than infusing new capital .234  This is something that ALL ETE can  \nalready  do without going private .235  Further, nothing would prevent Alloy Parent from borrowing \nthe funds for any new equity infusions —indeed, that appears to be the plan.236  And any additional \nleveraging of infused equity capital would turn magnify the risks related to ALLETE’s cost of debt  \ndiscussed earlier .237   \n \n231 Ex. MP-27, sched. 1 at 1 (Cady Rebuttal). \n232 Tr. vol. 1 at 126–27 (Cady). \n233 Tr. vol. 1 at 233 (Scissons). \n234 Indeed, Partners’ internal documents are clear that they have no obligation to provide further \ncapital beyond the initial purchase of ALLETE.  See  Ex. LPI -1004, sched. 2, DOC IR 60.01 Attach \nSupp 2 HCTS at 39 (Walters Surrebuttal) (stating that CPP [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL \nTRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]\n[ HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA \nENDS] ). \n235 Ex.

DOC -303 at 65–69 (Addonizio Direct). \n237 See supra part I.B . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n42 Finally, there  is no commitment to an  ROE  or ROE  cap that could mitigate the cost of \nequity that flows to ratepayers.  On the contrary, the Partners  expressly disavow  the idea of \nestablishing ROE parameters  that w ould apply to the capital they are committing  to Minnesota \nPower .238  Thus, there is  no guarantee that any additional capital that the Partners provide to \nALLETE will be low -cost. \nB. ALLETE’s Capital Need Can Be Mitigated.  \nALLETE’s stated capital need, as of direct testimony, was $4.2 billion for regulated \noperations over 2024 to 2028.239  In rebuttal, ALLETE updated this forecast to $4.8 billion over \n2025 to 2029.240  Intervenor witnesses, however, testifie d that ALLETE’s stated capital need was \nlikely inflated.   \nOAG witness Lebens identified several ways  to mitigate ALLETE’ s capital needs.  First, \nMinnesota Power could use power purchase agreements (PPAs) to buy power from third- party \nfacilities rather than owning  them  itself.241  Second, Minnesota Power could help facilitate its \ncustomers ’ producing their own electricity  to lessen the need for utility -owned facilities .242   Third, \nALLETE could sell non- core assets , such as  ALLETE Clean Energy, New Energy Equity, BNI \nEnergy, and ALLETE’s equity interest in American Transmission Company, and redeploy that  \ncapital to help fund the energy transition.243  (While ALLETE may claim that selling non -core \nassets is drastic, [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS]   \n \n \n238 Ex.

To the extent that the Partners and ALLETE do respond to Mr. Lebens’ capital -\nmitigation testimony , they argue that (1) a “PPA -only” strategy would be infeasible  and (2) \ndecreas ing dividend payment s is not feasi ble because  common- equity shares carry “dividend \nobligations.”251  But these arguments are misplaced.  \n \n245 See Ex.

The Proposed Acquisition Hold s Few Tangible Ratepayer Benefits . \nIn addition to the claimed  benefit of access to capital,  the Petitioners  tout the  Partners’ \n“deep industry expertise with respect to utility and energy infrastructure and renewables .”255  They \nalso ma ke several new commitments in rebuttal testimony under the rubric of “Ratemaking and \nAffordability.”256  For the reasons discussed below, these purported benefits do very little to offset \nthe transactions’ risks. \nWith respect to Partners’ expertise, those intervenor witnesses who assessed their expertise \ngenerally found its benefit to be negligible because it was unsupported by any concrete \nexamples,257 Minnesota Power already has quality, competent management,258 and the benefit was \nnot meaningful enough to offset the acquisition’s considerable downside risks.259  While Partners’ \n \n252 Ex.

For example, Minnesota Power commits that it will not seek \nrate recovery of flotation costs, investor -relations costs, or compensation  and expenses  for any \nboard member that is not independent from the Partners.262   \nThe value of these commitments is limited , for several reasons .  First, there is no evidence \nthat these expenses will be incurred after ALLETE goes private.263  Under cost -of-service \nregulation, utilities are not entitled to recover revenues from ratepayers for costs that they will not \nincur.  W hile the elimination of existing  costs would benefit ratepayers to the extent that  the \nsavings are passed on through rates, ALLETE is not conceding anything by committing not to \nrecover costs it will not incur.   Further, ALLETE has not proposed any reduction in its ROE to \nreflect the removal of flotation costs, despite admitting that flotation costs are currently included \nin its ROE.264  Finally , to the extent that the amount s that would be saved for these expense  \ncategories are in the record, the savings are modest.  For example, Minnesota Power currently \nrecovers about half of its investor- relations costs  from ratepayers , or approximately $174,000 per \n \n260 Ex.

They are not \noffering rate freezes or overall rate reductions .  They are not making any commitments as to the \ncost of future equity infusions, such as an ROE ceiling.  And they are not making any commitments \nto maintain or improve service quality.

However, the public interest applies to all customers, \nnot just low -income customers.272  And t o the extent that the transaction results in higher rates, it \nwill harm all customers, including low -income customers who receive arrearage forgiveness.273  \nThose future rate increases would put additional pressure on customer bills and  may cause  \nincreased arrearages.  \nD. Many of the Petitioners’ Commitments  Simply Affirm that Minnesota Power \nWill Comply with the Law or Maintain the Status Quo . \nThe Petitioners have provided a schedule memorializing various commitments pertaining \nto the post -acquisition behavior of ALLETE.274  The schedule , attached to the rebuttal testimony \nof Jennifer Cady, memorializ es 48 commitments and affirmations, including some commitments \nthat were originally made in the merger agreement , the petition , or the Petitioners’ direct testimony \nand others that are new as of rebuttal .275  Despite the claimed number of commitments , their value  \nto ratepayers and the community is  nominal at best.276  \nMany of the Petitioners’ commitments are not affirmative benefits but rather reflect an \neffort  to mitigate the risks of the acquisition by promising to maintain the status quo.277  For \n \n271 Ex.

For example, Commitment 36 \nis a statement of regulatory fact: “rate recovery and allocation of rate recovery of Minnesota Power \ncapital investments across customer classes are subject to [ Commission ] authority.”281  \nCommitment 37 states that “ALLETE’s capital structure will be maintained within the range approved by the Commission in the annual capital structure filing, and Minnesota Power will continue its efforts to manage its capital structure to the level approved in its most recent Minnesota rate case. ”\n282  This commitment simply affirms that the Commission has authority over ALLETE’s \ncapital structure , that ALLETE is required to comply with the Commission’s capital- structure \norders , and that ALLETE will continue to attempt to do so .283 \nThe record contains no indication that, before the Partners proposed to acquire ALLETE, \nthere w ere any discussions of firing senior management, reducing employees’ compensation or \n \n278 Ex.

The commitments offered to address these possibilities need to be understood as just that : attempts to mitigate potential harms of the acquisition, not affirmative \nbenefits to ratepayers or the public.  \nCONCLUSION \nFundamentally, this case is about assessing  whether the potential harms of the proposed \nacquisition of ALLETE outweigh the potential benefits.  As discussed above, the acquisition poses numerous, serious risks for ratepayers, the energy transition, and the Commission’s oversight of \nMinnesota Power.  It offers few benefits to anyone other than ALLETE’s shareholders.  Accordingly, the ALJ and the Commission should find that the risk of giving over control of Minnesota Power to private interests outweighs the potential benefits  and deem  the proposed \nacquisition inconsistent with the public interest.  \n \nDated:   May 1, 2025 KEITH ELLISON  \nAttorney General  \nState of Minnesota   /s/ \nPeter G.

Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 2g (the “Carbon Free Standard”).1 The leaders \nand professionals at ALLETE2 analyzed what they would need to do in order to meet the Carbon \nFree Standard, along with their already existing needs to maintain or upgrade aging infrastructure, \nreplace retiring generation, construct the  needed  transmission lines, and fulfill the Company’s  \nover-riding obligation to provide safe, reliable, and affordable service. That analysis led the \nCompany  to the conclusion that it needed to make a change.  \nThrough careful evaluation and deliberation, the Company  determined that acquisition by \na group of private infrastructure investors and pension funds would enable the Company  to make \nthe needed transformation to the Carbon Free Standard —without changing its underlying character \nas a utility focused on the communities it serves. Ultimately, the Company  selected Global \nInfrastructure Partners (“GIP”) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP Investments” \nand, together, “the Partners”) as the right fit. A s a result, the Partners entered into an agreement \nunder which the Company  would be acquired by entities controlled by CPP Investments and GIP \n(“Acquisition”).3 \nThe Partners are proud to become part of the community in Northern Minnesota and to \nhelp Minnesota Power continue to meet its obligation to serve its customers, from residential \ncustomers across the Iron Range and the North Shore to the largest industrial operations in the \nState, and everyone in between. The Partners recognize and accept the obligations that will come \n \n1 See Laws of Minnesota 2023, chapter 7, section 10.  \n2 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Initial Brief  “Minnesota Power ” \nrefers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise specifically defined, references to “ALLETE ” \nindicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including Minnesota Power and all regulated and non -regulated \nsubsidiaries. “The Company ” is a more general reference to ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n3 Ex. MP -1, Initial Filing – Petition for Approval, eDocket No. 20247 -208768 -01. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 2 \n with owning a public utility and will meet those obligations. In particular, the Partners understand \nthe requirement for Minnesota Power to comply with the Carbon Free Standard and are committed \nto helping the Company achieve this goal.  Each  of the Partners has owned regulated public utilities , \nand has a clearly demonstrated track record of living up to the obligations  of an owner of a public \nutility  company .  \n The Acquisition should be approved because it is consistent with the public interest. It will \neliminate the serious risk that the Company  will be unable to access the equity capital it needs to \ncomply with the Carbon Free Standard. This very significant benefit to the public interest far \noutweighs any speculative risks of the Acquisition. It will also benefit the public interest through \ncommitments related to affordability, workforce and labor protections, and continuity of leadership \nand core values at the Company . In addition, the Acquisition will benefit the public interest \nbecause it will allow the Company  to benefit from the Partners’ expertise investing in utilities  and \nrenewables, and experience in financing advanced energy technologies. In light of  these benefits, \nthe Acquisition has already been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the \nWisconsin Public Service Commission.  \nThe Acquisition will allow the Partners to invest  needed capital, subject to continued \nregulation by the Commission, to benefit Minnesota Power’s customers and the public interest. It \nwill also ensure that Minnesota Power has the resources it needs for the future, and the stability it \nneeds to chart its path tow ard that future. As demonstrated by substantial evidence in the record, \nthe Acquisition is in the public interest, and should be approved.  The Partners request that the \nAdministrative Law Judge recom mend, and that the Commission order, approval of the \nAcquisition.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 3 \n BACKGROUND  \nAs explained in more detail in the Petition, the Petitioners include Minnesota Power and \nthe Partners. The Petition requests approval of a transaction by which the Partners would become \nthe investors in ALLETE.4 Upon closing of the Acquisition, 40% of the interests in ALLETE will \nbe held by CPP Investments, 40% of the interests in ALLETE will be held through GIP’s most \nrecent fund, GIP Fund  V, and the other 20% of the interests in ALLETE will be held by a differen t \nGIP fund, Tower Bridge Infrastructure Partners, L.P. (“Tower Bridge”).5   \nCPP Investments is a professional investment management organization and an \nexperienced infrastructure investor that manages approximately CAD $700 billion in Canada \nPension Fund (“CPP”) assets, which are expected to grow to CAD $1 trillion over the next d ecade.6 \nCPP Investments was created pursuant to an act of Canadian Parliament to invest funds not \ncurrently needed to pay benefits in the best interests of contributors and beneficiaries.7 Its \ninvestment decision s are overseen by an independent board of directors and it has an “investment -\nonly mandate” by law, meaning that it is prohibited from engaging in activities other than investing \nits assets.8 CPP Investments and its employees limit their involvement to an investment \nmanagement role and do not perform the functions of senior officers or managers, or otherwise \nparticipate in the day -to-day managerial or operational control of any of the companie s in which \nit invests.9  \n \n4 Ex.

The investors \nwho commit capital to a GIP fund become limited partners in that fund, a nd a GIP -managed entity \nserves as the general partner of the fund.

The sole \nlimited partner and investor in Tower Bridge is the California Public Em ployees’ Retirement \nSystem (“CalPERS”) ,20 the nation’s largest public pension fund and a large investor in \ninfrastructure, including regulated utilities . Like CPP Investments, CalPERS is holding its \ninvestment in ALLETE through Tower Bridge as part of its real assets portfolio.21 As such, upon \nclosing, 60 percent of ALLETE will be owned by pension funds  or pension fund managers . \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nOn July 19, 2024, Minnesota Power filed a petition seeking Commission approval of the \nAcquisition .22 \nOn October 7, 2024, the Commission referred the matter to the Office of Administrative \nHearings ( “OAH ”) for contested case proceedings and for the Administrative Law Judge to \ndevelop the following issues on the record:  \nA. Are there any potential harms to the public interest from the proposed transaction, \nincluding in relation to cost or risk?  \n \nB. Are there any potential benefits to ratepayers, Minnesota, or the public interest from \nthe proposed transaction?  \n \n \n18 Ex.

This Brief refers to the parties who have \nrecommended rejection of the Acquisition in their testimony, which includes the Department, \nOAG, CUB, LPI, Sierra Club, and CURE,  as “Opposing Parties.” The evidentiary record of the \ncontested case proceeding has closed, and the matter is now before the ALJ on briefing from the \nParties.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \nMinnesota Statutes §  216B.50 p rovides that the Commission “shall give its consent” to the \nAcquisition if the Commission finds the Acquisition “consistent with the public interest .”26 The \nCommission has previously found that this standard does not require “an affirmative finding of \npublic benefit ,”27 nor does it require the Acquisition to result in affirmative benefits.28 Rather, th e \nstandard simply requires a finding that the Acquisition is compatible with the public interest.29 The \nCommission has established that, t o determine whether the Acquisition meets this standard , \n“perceived detriments or concerns must be weighed against perceived benefits to the public. If the \nperceived detriments do not outweigh the perceived benefits, the merger is deemed to be \n‘consistent with the public interest.’”30   \nFor the reasons explained below and based upon the substantial evidentiary record, the \nAcquisition readily meets this public interest standard  and should be approved . \n \n \n26 Minn.

These benefits include providing  ALLETE  a stable, reliable , and patient source of \nequity capital that will enable  Minnesota Power  to make the substantial investments needed to \nmeet its obligations, including  compliance  with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard. The \nAcquisition will also enable ALLETE to leverage the Partners ’ expertise as ALLETE transitions \nMinnesota Power to an increasingly cleaner syste m. There will be no adverse impact on customers, \nservice cost or quality, employees, or communities. While Parties have claimed that there are risks \nassociated with the Acquisition, these claims  are based on speculation, unsupported by evidence, \nand have been  thoroughly  addressed by the comprehensive conditions that the Petitioners have \nproposed for  this Acquisition.   \nFurther, in evaluating the public interest it is important to recognize that denial of the \nAcquisition would create  significant risk s to the public interest . The question at hand is not whether \nthe Acquisition will result in a change, but whether the change represented by the Acquisition is \nconsistent with  the public interest compared to the significant risks of maintaining the status quo.  \nAs noted by the OAG, the Carbon Free Standard is “pretty dang important,”31 and any risks to the \nCompany’s compliance wi th it should  be given substantial weight. The record is clear that the \nAcquisition will avoid the substantial risks of forcing Minnesota Power to continue to rely on \npublic markets to complete the energy transition , while providing additional benefits to the public \ninterest including rate reductions, additional funding for affordability programs, certainty for the \nCompany’s workforce , and allowing the Company to benefit from the Partners’ experience.  \n \n31 Tr. Evid. Hearing, Vol. 3  at 801:23–802:2.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 9 \n The record in this proceeding demonstrates that the Acquisition is not only consistent with \nthe public interest, but is better for the public interest  than the status quo. Accordingly, the \nAcquisition should be approved .  \nI. THE ACQUISITION WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR \nMINNESOTA POWER AND ITS CUSTOMERS . \nA. Reliable  Access to  Equity  Capital from the Partners will Facilitate  Minnesota \nPower’s Ability to  Comply with the Carbon Free Standard . \nOne of the key benefits of the Acquisition is that it will ensure Minnesota Power has \nreliable access to the equity capital it needs to meet its obligations to ensure safe, reliable, high \nquality electric service and comply with the Carbon Free Standard. A LLETE  correctly  determined \nthat meeting these obligations would require a substantial, unprecedented level of equity capital \ngoing forward. Further, ALLETE determined that it would be unreasonable —and in fact very risky \n—to rely on public markets to provid e the equity capital needed for these investments.  \nAs a result, ALLETE began a years -long evaluation and ultimately concluded the \nAcquisition was needed to ensure reliable and cost -effective access to the required equity capital \nfor these investments.  The evidence in the record demonstrates that ALLETE was right.  \n1. Minnesota Power ’s Capital Needs are Growing Dramatically because of \nthe Carbon Free Standard . \nThe Company , like any responsible business, continually evaluates how to provide high -\nquality service to its customers while meeting all of its obligations .32 These obligations includ e \nprovid ing safe, reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy.  \nIn recent years, changes in Minnesota energy policy have created significant new \nrequirements for Minnesota Power. The most significant of these is the Carbon Free Standard, \nMinn. Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 2g, which will require Minnesota Power to make substantial  \n \n32 Ex.

This transition, combined with the need to maintain and update the existing \ngrid to ensure resiliency and reliability , will drive a significant increase in Minnesota Power’s \ninvestments going forward.  \na) Minnesota Power ’s Capital Needs are Growing Substantially . \nALLETE’s most recent Form 10 -K filing indicates a need for $4.6 billion in investments \nfor regulated operations  (primarily Minnesota Power) from 2025 to 2029.33 These investments are \nneeded to transition Minnesota Power’s generation fleet, expand or upgrade its transmission and \ndistribution infrastructure, maintain aging infrastructure, and ensure system reliability and \nresiliency.34 These investments will require an increase in ALLETE’s capital expenditures that is \nseveral times larger than ALLETE’s prior capital expenditure levels. As explained by Witness \nTaran and reflected in Figure 1 below, the five -year investment plan is approximately 3.8 times \nlarger than the historical average.35 \n \n33 Ex.

ALLETE 2024 10 -K Capital Expenditures39 \n \nA substantial portion of the investments required for the next five years, and the years beyond, are \nrelated to transmission projects that have already been approved by the Commission and that the \nCompany will need to fund.40 These capital needs are not in question – they are a certainty.  \nThese capital requirements are enormous compared to Minnesota Power’s past levels of \ninvestments, and they will require a significant increase in equity capital to fund. The magnitude \nof this need can be measured in several ways.  \nFirst,  as Witness Taran explained, the 2025 -2029 capital plan for Minnesota Power \nrepresents more than 100 percent of ALLETE’s market capitalization.41 In other words, Minnesota \nPower forecasts that in the next five years it will make investments that are greater than the current \nequity value of the Company.  \nSecond, to fund these investments over the next five years ALLETE will need to issue \nmore equity capital tha n it has obtained over its entire 75 -year history as a publicly traded utility,42 \nalso representing a  substantial  change from business -as-usual.  \n \n39 Ex.

ALLETE is one of \nthe smallest utilities in the country by market capitalization,43 but its need for equity capital is the \nlargest of any utility in proportion to its market capitalization.44 As shown in Schedule 2 of Witness \nQuackenbush’s Rebuttal Testimony, ALLETE’s equity needs for 2025 -2027 alone are estimated \nto be approximately three  times the median of United States utilities (16% for ALLETE and 5.3% \nfor all utilities). The difficulties for ALLETE resulting from that differential are compounded by \nALLETE’s small size and risks associated with Minnesota Power’s high concentration of m arket -\nsensitive industrial customers.   \nFourth,  not only are  ALLETE’s capital investment requirements relatively larger, they also \nare growing faster than those of other utilities. As shown in Schedule 1 of Witness Quackenbush’s \nRebuttal testimony, ALLETE’s future capital expenditures are accelerating at a rate more than \nthree  times historical expenditures.45 While nearly all utilities anticipate an increase in \ninvestments, no utility approaches the  relative  magnitude and rate of growth of additional  equity \nthat will be required for Minnesota Power.46 In other words, the increase to equity capital that \nALLETE must make going forward is the greatest of all measured utilities. This is not a business -\nas-usual proble m. Rather, this problem required the solution that ALLETE identified, and will \nachieve,  with the Acquisition.   \n \n43 Ex.

The largest change, other than \nMinnesota Power, is an increase of 206 percent by Wisconsin Energy Corporation. The average increase, when \nexcluding ALLETE, is an increase in capital spe nding of approximately 125 percent. Id.47 Ex. MP -29, Taran Rebuttal \nat 13 :3–15, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -05. As Witness Taran explained, it is reasonable to exclude the 2020 COVID -\nyear when evaluating forecast variance, because the pandemic’s impact on delaying capital projects could not have \nbeen anticipated. Even including the 2020 COVID -year, the average variance over the last five years was only 9 \npercent.   \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 14 \n b) Minnesota Power ’s Forecasted Investment Needs for Regulated \nOperations are Very Reliable . \nOpposing Parties argue that, despite the evidence in the record, Minnesota Power’s \ninvestment forecast is overstated. The evidence in the record demonstrates that the Opposing \nParties are incorrect for several reasons.  \nFirst, Minnesota Power’s capital expenditure forecasts for regulated operations have been \nhistorically accurate. When excluding the COVID -year of 2020, the average variance in Minnesota \nPower’s capital forecast related to regulated operations over the last five years  is only five \npercent.47 This evidence demonstrates the reliability of Minnesota Power’s regulated capital \ninvestment forecasts.  Moreover, ALLETE’s expected investment levels for Minnesota Power are \nnot speculative. As noted above, the capital plan includes costs for transmission projects that are \nalready approved  and under development , and which will ultimately require billions of dollars in \ninvestments.48 It also includes costs related to wind and solar acquisitions that have already been \nselected pursuant to a competitive bidding process for which the Department has recommended \napproval or are currently underway . 49 \nSecond, the arguments raised by Opposing Parties to question the reliability of the forecast \nare not supported by the record.

To the contrary, their \nsuggestions reflect a superficial assessment , and failure to grasp the complexities , of utility \nforecasting.  \nFinally, even if Minnesota Power’s needs turn out to be lower than the current forecast, \nthere is no reasonable dispute that the Company’s investment needs  are increasing substantially , \nincluding as a result of some already -approved projects . The $4.6 billion forecast for Regulated \nOperations could be off by 20 percent (dramatically more than the 5 percent historical variance), \nand it would still be triple the level of historical investments.72 It is undisputed that Minnesota \nPower’s capital needs are substa ntially increasing, and that a key driver for that increase is the \nCarbon Free Standard. Minnesota Power will need equity capital to fund these investments, and \nthe primary purpose of the Acquisition is to address that need.  \n2. Relying on Public Markets would be Very Risky for Customers and \nMinnesota Power . \nGiven the large increase in the need for investments going forward, Minnesota Power \nanalyzed whether it would be able to obtain the necessary equity capital using its historical public \nsources. Based on an extensive process and on the advice of its financi al advisors, ALLETE \nconcluded that it would be unreasonable and too risky to continue to rely on public markets for \nthis new equity. This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. The Opposing Parties who \nquestion ALLETE  rely on unsupported conclusi ons based solely on theory and provided by \nwitnesses with little to no relevant experience.  \n \n72 Ex. MP -11, Taran Direct at 6, Table 1, eDocket No. 202412 -212968 -05. The forward looking average annual \ninvestment is $849 million, which is approximately 3.8 times the historical average annual investment level. If the \nforward -looking investment were reduced by 20 percent, it would be approximately 3 times larger than the historical \n$225 million average annual investment level. ( [ $849 * 0.80 = $679 ] / $225 = 3.01 )  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 18 \n a) Publicly Traded Companies Obtain Equity Investment by Issuing \nNew Shares in Public Markets.  \nRegulated utilities like Minnesota Power fund capital investments using debt and equity.73 \nMinnesota Power obtains debt financing by issuing first mortgage bonds, generally to large \nfinancial institutions, and plans to continue to do so.74 Historically, Minnesota Power has obtained \nequity capital by issuing common shares to potential investors through public stock markets.75 \nMinnesota Power has issued many shares of stock, and they are continuously traded among public \ninvestors both large and small. ALLETE does not receive any capital when its existing shares are \ntraded. In order to obtain equity capital, ALLETE must issue ne w shares, a process that involves \nsignificant time, cost and risk.76 \nThe record clearly shows that ALLETE would need to raise more than $1 billion in new \nequity to fund its expected investment requirements over the next five years.77 In comparison, the \nCompany has raised only $1.3 billion in equity from public markets in the 75 years it has been \npublicly traded.78 \nb) Relying on Public Markets for Equity Capital in the Future would \nbe Risky for ALLETE and Minnesota Power Customers . \nIn the face of this unprecedented increase in its need for equity capital, ALLETE analyzed \nits options. One option was  to attempt  to continue as a small publicly traded company and rely on \nthe public markets for equity capital; ALLETE referred to this as the standalone financing plan. \n \n73 In the Matter of Minnesota Power’s Petition for Approval of its Capital Structure and Authorization to Issue \nSecurities Under Minn.

Following an extensive evaluation process, \nALLETE’s Board of Directors, experienced management team, and financia l advisors all \nconcluded that the standalone financing plan would be unduly challenging and risky. Instead, \nALLETE decided that acquisition by the Partners was the best path to obtain the necessary equity \ncapital.  \ni) ALLETE’s conclusion that relying on public markets would be too risky is supported \nby the testimony of experienced, highly credible experts.  \nThe record contains substantial evidence to support ALLETE’s decision. Part of that \nevidence is the testimony of Minnesota Power’s management team. Witness Taran, ALLETE’s \nAssistant Treasurer , testified:  \nIt is highly likely that ALLETE would have difficulty raising the amounts of capital \nMinnesota Power will need in the future without the Acquisition. ... While \nALLETE has been able to navigate the risks of public markets in the past, the \noutsized and ongoi ng nature of the projected capital needs presents a significant \nrisk that needs to be addressed.

Recognizing that ALLETE is a relatively \nsmall company with significant equity needs in the coming years, without the \nAcquisition the re is no guarantee that the Company will be able to access the capital \nit needs for Minnesota Power’s clean energy transition investments.83 \n \nWitness Scissons also testified about the impact the Acquisition will have on achieving the Carbon \nFree Standard:  \nGiven the Company’s size, access to capital at the scale ALLETE has forecasted \nwould be a t very high risk, and if the current operating environment (including tariff \nimpacts, large customer cyclicality, and policy uncertainty) remains, it would be \nhighly unlikely the Company could achieve its carbon free goals as planned and \nother system investment (e.g., grid resilience investments and enhancements) \nwould also be threatened. Our ability to invest in advanced technologies, such as \nclean firm resources, woul d also be jeopardized.84 \n \nWitness Scissons has over 20 years of experience in the utility industry.85 He spent ten years \nworking at an investment group focused on analyzing gas and electric utilities, followed by more \nthan ten years of experience with ALLETE as a financial planner, Corporate Treasurer, and \ncurrently the Chief Financial Officer.86 \n The testimony of Witness Taran and Witness Scissons is further supported by the testimony \nof Witness Quackenbush who agrees ALLETE would face severe challenges accessing the \nrequired equity from public markets.87 Witness Quackenbush’s experience is also extensive and \ndirectly relevant to the analysis in this proceeding.

Since the Acquisition was announced, \nMinnesota Power has suffered from the volatility of its reliance on a few large c ustomers , making \nMinnesota Power a more volatile investment . In January 2025, US Steel , Minnesota Power’s \nlargest single customer,  provided a four -year notice that it would terminate its electric service \nagreement with Minnesota Power.96 On March 20, 2025, Cleveland -Cliffs , Minnesota Power’s \nsecond -largest customer,  announced that it would idle two mines in Minnesota Power’s service \nterritory, and lay off more than 600 workers.97 Absent the Acquisition  (and associated expectation \n \n91In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -16-664, Findings of Fact, Conclusions, and Order at 53 (March 12, 2018) , eDocket \nNo. 20183-140963 -01; In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for \nElectric Service in Minnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -21-335, Findings of Fact, Conclusions, and Order at 63 (Feb. \n28, 2023) , eDocket No. 20232 -193486 -01. \n92 Ex.

At the time of Rebuttal Testimony on March 4, 202 5, Witness Scissons testified that \nconcerns about the “potential impact of tariffs, customer uncertainty, termination notices and \ninterest rate volatility” could impact ALLETE’s ability to access equity on public markets.99 \nWitness Quackenbush agreed that “uncertainty in tariff and trade issues enhance … concerns” \nabout ALLETE’s access to capital.100 It is undisputable that market uncertainty and the effects  of \ntariffs are going to have an impact on public markets. The experienced expert witnesses in this \nmatter already had significant concerns about ALLETE’s ability to compete for equity capital in \nthe public market. The challenges will be even greater while  public markets are unsettled, further \ncompounding the risk of relying on public markets to fund the energy transition.  \nThird, t he consequences of this uncertainty are even more dire because  ALLETE would \nneed to be a serial issuer  to raise the amount of equity capital  it needs  through public markets. A \nserial issuer has “perpetually repeating issuance needs,” and may need to issue new shares “every \nyear or even more often.”101 As Witness  Quackenbush analyzed , in order to meet its need through \npublic markets, ALLETE would need to make public equity issuances at least once (or more) every \nyear.102  \n \n98 See Ex. MP-28, Scissons Rebuttal at 6:16–18, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -04 (“Without the transaction, the market \nlikely would have reacted negatively to [the US Steel announcement] . . . .”).  \n99 Ex.

Because it issues new shares so frequently, a serial issuer faces the possibility of investor \nfatigue —when large volumes of new shares are issued each year, p ublic market investors are less \ninterested in investing.103 A serial issuer also faces uncertainty about the timing —rather than being \nable to issue public equity at the most advantageous times, a serial issuer is forced to continue \nissuing regardless of mark et conditions.  \nFourth, the record demonstrates a real -world example —of a Minnesota utility —that was \nnot able to obtain the capital it needed from public markets. As described by Witness  \nQuackenbush, on September 15, 2008, Otter Tail Corporation  (“OTC”),  the parent company of the \nMinnesota electric utility Otter Tail Power Company, announced a public offering of 5 million \nshares.104 At the time of the announcement, its stock price was $39.95, suggesting that OTC could \nsell 5 million shares and raise approximately $200 millio n from its public offering, before \nunderwriting costs.105 Contrary to expectations, OTC was only able to issue 4.5 million shares at \nthe price of $30.00, meaning that it raised only 65 percent of the equity capital it sought .106  \nThe effect on OTC and its customers continues to this day. Because the public market \nvolatility affected OTC’s offering, OTC ultimately issued approximately 1.3 million more shares \nthan anticipated at the time of announcement to obtain the relatively small amount of capital \nraised.107 As a result, over the last 16 years, OTC has paid approximately $29 million in dividends \n \n103 See Ex. MP-28, Scissons Rebuttal , Schedule 3 at 4, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -04. \n104 Ex. MP -30, Quackenbush Rebuttal a t 15:21–16:13 , eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -12. \n105 See Ex.

To \nraise $155  million at a share price of $39.95, OTC would have issued approximately 3.88 million shares, or 1.3 million \nfewer shares than OTC ultimately issued at $30.00 per share for the capital raise.

This is a cautionary example that, despite what general market \ntheories in textbooks might say, the public market will not always provide the amount of equity \ncapital that a utility company needs.  \nThe record also demonstrat es the lengths to which the ALLETE Board went to evaluate its \noptions.  Described in more detail in the Proxy Statement, the Board engaged in a years -long \nanalysis with financial advisors about its options.108 The Board, informed by careful analysis by \nfinancial advisor J.P. Morgan, evaluated a standalone plan or the option of pursuing an acquisition \nby infrastructure and pension investors. The Proxy Statement summarizes the analyses the Board \nundertook, includ ing a five -page analysis of the specific factors the Board evaluated in making its \ndecision , along with independent fairness opinions .109 The Opposing Parties have barely referred \nto this evidence in their testimony, and do not appear to have done serious analysis  to understand \nor respond to it.  \nThis evidence is substantial, and it supports the conclusions reached by ALLETE’s board \nand professional management team that : (1) it would be unreasonably risky for ALLETE and \nMinnesota Power to rely on public markets for equity capital; and (2) the Acquisition is the best \npath forward to ensure access to the equity capital Minnesota Power will need.  \niii) The risks of relying on public markets for equity could have negative impacts on \ncustomers  and the public interest . \nThe record includes substantial evidence that relying on public markets for equity capital \nwould pose significant risks  to Minnesota Power’s customers. Witness Taran refers to these  risks \nwith the following observation :  \n \n108 Ex. MP -1, Initial Filing – Petition for Approval , Attachment L, 41 –55, eDocket  No. 20247 -208768 -01. \n109 Ex.

It is also extremely risky, which the \nother Parties do not seem to recognize. If the Acquisition is not approved, the \nCompany m ay not have access to the capital it requires to ensure it can meet \nMinnesota’s requirements and continue to provide safe, reliable, and affordable \nservice.110 \n  \nThese risks could negatively impact customers and the public interest in several ways.  \nFirst, the inability to raise the necessary equity through public markets when needed could \njeopardize Minnesota Power’s ability to make necessary and timely investments to ensure safe, \nreliable service  and comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard . While Opposing Parties seem \nto dismiss, offhand, the possibility that public market funding might not appear when needed, the \nrecord demonstrates that it can and has happened.111 If Minnesota Power is not able to obtain the \nequity capital it needs, some investments will need to be delayed or abandoned. Challenges \nobtaining funding could jeopardize Minnesota Power’s share of transmission projects already \napproved by MISO and the Commission. Most importantly, it could impact plans for compliance \nwith the Carbon Free Standard . As Witness  Scissons explained, “ it would be highly unlikely the \nCompany could achieve its carbon free goals as planned ” without the Acquisition.112 \nSecond, even if Minnesota Power is able to get the equity capital it needs from public \nmarkets, the record shows a substantial risk that doing so could increase Minnesota Power’s cost \nof capital to the detriment of ratepayers. As Witnesses Taran, Scissons and Quackenbush observed, \nraising the necessary public capital would invariably require serial issuances, which would in turn \n \n110 Ex.

In addition \nto the numerous other risks discussed herein, r elying on the public markets will take considerable \ntime and resources from the Company and its management team, and that necessarily diminishes  \nthe time and resources that could otherwise go toward managing  the Company itself and working \ntoward creative solutions that serve the needs of the Company, its customers, and the State of \nMinnesota.  \nObtaining this volume of new equity from public markets would have a negative impact \non the Company’s cashflow. Relying on public markets would require ALLETE to issue many \nmore shares to public shareholders, who expect to receive regular dividends  in addition to the \namount already spent on annual dividends.114 This will impact customers by putting pressure on \nthe cash ALLETE has to operate its business and make the investments it needs.  \nBased on the Acquisition stock price and current annual dividends, obtaining $1 billion in \nnew equity from public markets could increase dividend obligations by as much as $43 million per \nyear.115 If ALLETE has to increase its dividend payments by $43 million per year, that is $43 \nmillion it will not be able to invest in capital projects each year  at a time when ALLETE has \nsignificant capital needs . These increased dividend obligations would be permanent and , over time, \n \n113 Ex. MP -30, Quackenbush Rebuttal a t 7:28–31, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -12 (“Serial issuances will affect public \ninvestors’ views and the share price they are willing to pay.

The need \nfor $1 billion in new equity capital could become much greater if the Company cannot fund some \nof the capital investments from its own cashflow. As equity needs increase, the risk of relying on \npublic markets increases even further.  \nThis could lead to a spiral of reducing cashflow at a time of increasing capital investments. \nFor instance, each time ALLETE issues public equity, it increases its current dividend obligations. \nAs dividend obligations increase, it will reduce cashflow and increase the need for new equity to \nfund the capital plan —which could, in turn, further increase dividend obligations. This cycle is \none reason why every experienced expert in this case concluded that it is not reasonable for \nALLETE to rely on public marke ts to obtain this equity  and that ALLETE should , instead , rely on \nthe patient equity made available by the Partners.  \nIn addition , cash flow is a critical part of credit rating analysis, and negative impacts on \ncash flow could have an impact on credit ratings. If ALLETE has trouble accessing capital, credit \nratings agencies will notice and incorporate those challenges in their ratin gs analysis. 116 Negative \nimpacts on the financial health of the enterprise could lead to a downgrade, which would make \nfuture debt issuances more expensive —and the additional costs will be directly passed on to \ncustomers.  This is a key problem that Opposing Parties overlook when portraying the Acquisition \nas a potential credit risk —they fail to recognize that, without the Acquisition, the Company is on \na much riskier path.  \n \n116 See Ex. MP -29, Taran Rebuttal at 19 :30–20:8, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -05 (referencing S&Ps analysis about \nthe impact of equity issuances on credit ratings).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 29 \n Further , every time ALLETE issues equity there is a n associated  cost, referred to as \n“flotation costs .”117 If the Acquisition is approved, the Petitioners have committed that flotation \ncosts will not be included in future rates.  If the Company is , instead,  required to rely on public \nmarkets, it will incur flotation costs  every time it issues equity . Flotation costs are historically \nincluded in the ROE and rates and  are recovered from customers.118 Witness Scissons also \nexplained that issuing additional equity would require additional resource commitments by the \nInvestor Relations team . As the need  for public equity expands, ALLETE would need to increase \nthe size and cost of its investor relations team , which would also increase costs for ratepayers.119 \nEach issuance also requires attention from Company management, which is then diverted from \nother efforts.  \nIn addition to these negative impacts on customers, issuing millions of additional shares on \npublic markets could have a negative impact on shareholders. While the Opposing Parties \nappropriately focus on potential impacts on customers, existing shareholder s must also be \nconsidered when evaluating the public interest.120 Each time new shares are issued, the ownership \ninterests of existing shares are reduced and, if new shares are issued at lower prices, it can further \ndrive down the value of existing shares.121 ALLETE  has legal obligations  to consider  the interests \n \n117 In the Matter of the Application of Minneso ta Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Utility Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -23-155, Bulkley Direct at 35  (Nov. 1, 2023), eDocket No. 20311 -200095 -03.118 \nSee In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates  for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -21-335, FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS , AND ORDER at 46 (Feb. 28, 2023), \neDocket No. 20232 -193486 -01 (including flotation costs when setting rates).  \n118 See In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates  for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -21-335, FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS , AND ORDER at 46 (Feb. 28, 2023), \neDocket No. 20232 -193486 -01 (including flotation costs when setting rates).  \n119 Ex.

Witness Scissions testified:  \n[I]f the goal were to merely obtain the largest financial gain for shareholders \nor if the Company otherwise was not focused on enabling it to meet and \nachieve Minnesota policy goals and requirements in its current form, \nALLETE could have undertaken an enti rely different approach. Instead, as \ndescribed in the Background to the Merger Agreement (Attachment L to the \nPetition), the process was intentional to ensure the cultural values of \nALLETE would remain intact, that Partners would have the resources and \nexpertise necessary to support ALLETE, and that Partners are committed to \nand invested in Minnesota Power executing on its strategy to comply with \nMinnesota’s CFS.124 \n \nIn short, ALLETE’s  decision to move forward with the Acquisition was motivated by the need for \nreliable, economic access to equity capital, from a source that does not create risks for customers \nor harm existing shareholders , and that allows  the Company to retain its long -standing  values and \ncommitment to the customers  and communities it serves .

Neither of the Department’s experts ha s any experience in financing, much less \nutility financing.125 Neither of the Department’s experts has any experience in obtaining capital \nfrom public markets.126 Department Witness Vavro has not received any training related to utility \nfinancing .127 Some witnesses rely on academic textbooks rather than any relevant experience or \ntraining when evaluating the Acquisition. Similarly, OAG Witness Lebens also has no experience \nin financing, and has never been responsible for issuing equity on public markets —in fact, he has \nnever even been involved in a public issuance.128 \nThe testimony and analysis of these witnesses must be understood in the proper context: \nthey do not have the relevant experience or training to provide credible analysis or opinions about \nwhether ALLETE can obtain the equity it needs from public markets.  \nOne example of the flaws in the analysis of these witnesses is the Department’s reliance \non the Efficient Market Hypothesis . This hypothesis  assumes, generally, that markets have fully \ninternalized all available information and produce efficient prices based on that information.129 \nThe Department  focuses this analysis on whether it is possible to predict the best times to issue \nequity, on the basis of this academic theory.130 In doing so, the Department  misses entirely the \n \n125 Ex.

As discussed above, the Department’s witnesses have never been responsible for, or \ninvolved in , issuing shares on the public market.132 The witnesses in this case who have such \nexperience , and have been in extensive and continuous dialogue with public equity utility investors \nand research analysts,  disagree with the Department’s  conclusions.  \nAdmissions during the evidentiary hearing revealed that it is possible the Opposing Parties \ncould be wrong  and that ALLETE may not be able to get the capital it needs from the public market \nat the time the capital is needed.133 Despite this, the record does not include any analysis from the \nOpposing Parties of the effects  of a capital shortfall on  ALLETE and its customers .

The Opposing Parties  do not acknowledge  these risks  or incorporate them into their analysis . \n3. Acquisition by the Partners will Avoid the Risks of Relying on Public \nMarkets to Comply with the Carbon Free Standard . \nThe Acquisition will avoid the risks of relying on public markets. Instead of hoping  that \npublic markets will provide the dramatically increased  equity  capital Minnesota Power requires  at \nthe time it is required , the Acquisition will provide a sure and steady source of capital . The \nAcquisition will protect Minnesota Power and its customers from the uncertainty and risk of \nrelying on public markets. The cycle described above, in which serial equity issuances create cash \nflow problems, which in turn require m ore equity issuances, can be avoided entirely. Instead of \nspending time and resources figuring out how to get the capital it needs to fund the energy \ntransition, the reliable and stable capital provided by the Partners will allow Minnesota Power to \nspend i ts time identifying  and implementing  creative solutions to the challenges of the energy \ntransition. This key benefit of the Acquisition is the avoidance of risk . As described above, the risk \nof relying on public markets is real and material —and the Acquisi tion will avoid that risk entirely.  \nThe Opposing Parties entirely ignore this risk and incorrectly assume, without review or analysis, \nthat the old way of doing business will continue to work.  \nOne clear benefit of the Acquisition is that the Partners will provide patient  equity capital. \nInvestors in public markets, as discussed above, expect regular quarterly dividends. The record \ndemonstrates that when those regular dividends are not paid, public investors punish publicly \ntraded companies.135 The record also shows that the requirement to pay these dividends will \n \n135 See Ex. MP -30, Quackenbush Rebuttal, Schedule 3, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -12. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 34 \n materially imp ede Minnesota Power’s ability to fund its capital plan.  In contrast, the Partners are \nmaking an investment in ALLETE with a long -term focus that does not require regular  quarterly \ndividends. In fact, the Partners have committed to specific limitations on their ability to receive \ndividends if ALLETE is not financially healthy  or if necessary to provide Minnesota Power with \nthe equity needed to fund its five -year investment plan ,136 a benefit of the Acquisition and \nsomething that public investors would never do.  \nThis will be particularly important as Minnesota Power requires additional equity for its \ncapital investment plans. The Partners, in contrast to public investors, will have the option to defer \ndividends to ensure that Minnesota Power has the capital it needs. In fact, the record demonstrates  \nthat the Partners have specifically contemplated the possibility that they will not receive dividends \nfrom ALLETE every year.  Each of Witness Bram and Alley expressly contemplate  the “deferral \nor reinvestment of dividen ds” as a potential option to fund Minnesota Power’s five -year capital \nplan.137  \nWhile these statements  do not reflect specific plans, they are  an indication that the Partners \nare comfortable with the possibility that they will not receive continuous dividends from ALLETE, \nand that doing so would be consistent with their long -run investment thesis . Mitigating the \nrequirement for continuous quarterly dividend payments required by public investors is a \nsignificant benefit of the Acquisition to ALLETE and Minnesota Power customers . \nOpposing Parties raise doubts about whether the Partners will actually provide the capital \nthey have committed to providing . The Partners’ commitment to providing the capital that \nMinnesota Power needs is reflected in both the Partners’ $3.9 billion investment  and in the \n \n136 Ex.

CPP Investments Witness Alley testified: “The Partners intend \nto provide sufficient equity capital to Minnesota Power for the long -term, and for the entire \nduration of our ownership.”138 GIP Witness Bram testified:  \nWe are committed to ALLETE and its customers, and concerns to the contrary fail \nto understand the reasons for the Acquisition and the nature of the Partners and their \ninvestments. On behalf of their investors, many of whom are pensioners, the \nPartners alre ady are investing a substantial amount of capital to acquire ALLETE \nand will need to make future investments in order to make that initial investment, \nand future investments, a success. That success depends on enhancing the long -\nterm value of Minnesota Pow er and ALLETE, which cannot be accomplished by \ndenying the Company equity capital when needed.139 \n \nThe Partners provided these statements in the form of testimony from high level executives  who \nwere prepared  to, and would have, if given the opportunity, provide d the testimony under oath . \nPartner Witnesses Alley and Bram, however, did not take the stand during the evidentiary hearing \nonly because the Opposing Parties chose, at the last possible moment, not to ask them any \nquestions. The Partners understand the gravity of providing this testimony and did not do so lightly.   \n The Partners have also provided commitments to further demonstrate that funding will be \nprovided to ALLETE and Minnesota Power. Specifically, the Partners have offered a binding, \nenforceable commitment that Alloy Parent —the entity that will own all of the  ALLETE stock and \nwill receive funding from the Partners —will fully fund Minnesota Power’s five year capital plan \nas described in the most recent Form 10-K filing.140 The Partners expect that this commitment will  \nbe included in a Commission Order, which wil l make it binding and enforceable by the \nCommission. There can be no reasonable doubt that the Partners will fully fund the equity capital \nneeds of Minnesota Power as demonstrated in that commitment . \n \n138 Ex.

MP -27, Cady Rebuttal, Schedule 1, Commitment 1, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -09.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 36 \n  Further, the Opposing Parties doubt s’ concerning the Partners’ commitment to ALLETE \ndemonstrate their lack of understanding about the Acquisition. The Partners are investing $3.9 \nbillion to purchase ALLETE and Minnesota Power. If the Partners do not make the investments \nnecessary to ensure that Minnesota  Power is a healthy utility, they would be putting their initial \n$3.9 billion investment  at severe risk and foreclosing any realistic chan ce of gain. Withholding \nfunding from a company in which  they investe d billions of dollars in would violate “investment \n101,”141 and Opposing Parties have not provided any rational explanation for why the Partners \nwould do that.  \nIn fact, the Partners have a strong incentive to do exactly the opposite. The Partners are \ninvesting in ALLETE in part because Minnesota Power needs to make a lot of investments in the \nfuture. These investments are an opportunity for the Partners to deploy  capital to their benefit by \nincreasing the value of ALLETE. When the Partners invest their capital in utility projects approved \nby the Commission, it will benefit both the Partners and the public interest.   \nUltimately, the Partners mean what they have said in testimony, and what they have \ncommitted to do. The Partners will provide Minnesota Power with the equity capital it needs to \ncomplete the energy transition, comply with the Carbon Free Standard, and cont inue to provide \nsafe, reliable, and affordable service to customers.  \n4. The Acquisition will Provide the Equity C apital that Minnesota Power \nNeeds.  \nThe record includes substantial evidence that Minnesota Power has a substantially  \nincreased need for equity capital going forward, and that relying on the public markets for that \ncapital would be risky both for the Company and its customers. The Opposing Parties who dispute \n \n141 Tr. Evid. Hearing, Vol. 1 at 227, 230 ( Scissons Cross) ; Tr. Evid. Hearing, Vol. 2 at 347 ( Quackenbush Cross) ; Tr. \nEvid. Hearing, Vol . 2 at 382 (Bulkley Cross)  (Department Counsel repeatedly referring to “investment 101”) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 37 \n these facts have produced no significant evidence to support their theories, and their arguments are \nprimarily based on the opinions of witnesses who have limited, if any, relevant experience and \ntraining in public markets or finance. The experts who have substantial relevant experience all \nconcluded that the Company faces substantial risks relying on public markets, and that Acquisition \nprovides the best path to avoid those risks. Avoiding these risks is a substantial benefit of the \nAcquisition, and one of  the reasons why the Acquisition is in the public interest.  \nB. The Partners have Made Additional Commitments in Support of the Public \nInterest . \nThe Acquisition will also provide benefits for Minnesota Power and its customers that \nsupport the public interest in the form of reduced rates, elimination of customer arrearages for low-\nincome  customers and ensuring additional protections for local union members.  \nThe Partners made a number of commitments regarding ratemaking and affordability, all \nwith the intention of maintaining affordable rates for Minnesota Power’s customers. To that end, \nthe Partners have committed that, for as long as they own ALLETE, Minneso ta Power will not \nseek rate recovery of board member compensation or expenses for those board members that are \nnot independent from the Partners.142 In addition, the Partners and Company committed not to seek \nrate recovery of flotation costs or investor rela tions costs, as well as ensuring that Acquisition \ncosts, transition costs related to the Acquisition, and other transaction costs are not recovered from \nutility customers.143  \nThe benefits of the Acquisition extend to improving energy affordability more generally as \nwell. As GIP Witness Bram and Company Witness Cady testified, there will be no proposed \nreduction in the Company’s currently designed affordability program budget or  the current \n \n142 Ex.

As Partner Witnesses Alley and Bram testified, the Partners have agreed, \nin partnership with Minnesota Power and the En ergy Cents Coalition, to significantly reduce \narrearages of Minnesota Power’s residential customers.145 This commitment will provide a benefit \nof up to $3.5 million to the Company’s customers and help them erase long -standing residential \narrearages.146 Moreover, as CPP Investments Witness Alley testified, this is a benefit that is not \navailable from public market investors and represents an additional benefit of the Acquisition.147 \nFinally, the Partners’ commitment to the public interest is further demonstrated by the \nadditional protections that the Acquisition will provide for Minnesota Power’s  work force . As \nPartner Witnesses Alley and Bram and Company Witness Cady testified, the Partners worked in \ncollaboration with IBEW Local 31 to extend the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement for \ntwo years and implement a first -ever Neutrality Agreement between t he Company and IBEW \nLocal 31.148 Like the customer arrearages benefit described ab ove, th ese commitments further \nemphasize the benefits to Minnesota Power and its community that will result from this \nAcquisition.  \nC. The Partners ’ Expertise as Utility and Energy Investors can Benefit ALLETE \nand Minnesota Power ’s Customers.  \nOne of the many benefits of the Acquisition will be the ability of the Company’s \nmanagement and the ALLETE Board of Directors to utilize the expertise of CPP Investments and \n \n144 Ex.

Opposing Parties argue that the availability of Partner expertise is not a meaningful benefit \nof the Acquisition, but they take two mutually inconsistent paths to that conclusion, both of which \nare contradicted by substantial record evidence.  \n1. GIP has Relevant  Experience and Expertise . \nIn both Direct Testimony and Rebuttal Testimony, GIP Witness Bram provided concrete \nexamples of how GIP’s expertise as an investor in regulated infrastructure and renewable energy \ncompanies can provide numerous benefits to the Company’s management and the Company \noverall. GIP will offer the Company access to specific avenues of support, such as GIP’s CEO \nCouncil,149 Renewable Roundtable,150 and Chief Information Officer Summit,151 each of which \nwill provide best practices to management for capturing value and mit igating risk across the \nCompany including, as needed , thoughts on improved, capital expenditure management, energy \nyield optimization, debt financing, tax equity, and procurement processes.   \nGIP is also an experienced investor in regulated utilities. GIP owns a co -controlling stake \nin Naturgy Energy Group, one of the largest integrated utilities and infrastructure companies in \nEurope with over 3.8 million electric customers in Spain, over 1  million electric customers in \nArgentina and Panama, and gas utilities in Europe and Latin America that serve over 10 million \ncustomers.152 GIP also owns a co -controlling stake in Scotia Gas Networks (“SGN”), the second \nlargest gas utility in the United Kingdom , with assets in both England and Scotland, serving \n \n149 Ex.

MP -33, Bram Rebuttal at 54 , eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -08. \n152 As explained by Witness Bram, GIP invested in Naturgy in September 2016 and has since invested €12.5  billion \nin capital to the utility, including €7.4  billion related to growth projects, including approximately 2  GW of renewable \ncapacity (over a 65% incre ase) and an approximately 30% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions relative to 2017 \nlevels.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 40 \n approximately 6  million customers. GIP has supported SGN’s necessary upgrades and investments \nto maintain safe operations and deliver on long -term performance objectives.153   \nGIP’s investments also include other types of regulated assets, like airports and ports, \nincluding its ongoing investment in the second largest airport in the United Kingdom, Gatwick \nAirport.154 Through over fifteen years of ownership, GIP has helped to modernize and expand \nGatwick Airport, improving key metrics like passenger experience and efficiency, helping make \nGatwick Airport the world’s most efficient and busiest single runway airport. The se investments \nnot only show GIP’s familiarity with the obligations of owning regulated assets but are evidence \nthat despite the generalized fears of private equity ownership, GIP is a responsible owner with a \ntrack record of supporting its investments and respecting the regulatory co mpact.155 \nGIP also invests in and supports portfolio companies with considerable experience and \nexpertise in developing renewable energy assets and has extensive relationships necessary to \nsupport those efforts. With over $15  billion of equity capital invested or co mmitted, GIP portfolio \ncompanies now operate over 23 GW of renewable assets globally (including over 16GW of \noperating wind and solar capacity), with an additional approximately 178  GW under construction \nor in development across at least 25 different count ries.156 By comparison, since 2013 Minnesota \nPower has added nearly 0.9  GW of renewable energy resources, while ALLETE’s unregulated \nsubsidiaries have developed approximately 2.3  GW of renewable energy resources.157 As \n \n153 Ex.

Through its investment in and support of SGN, GIP is hel ping to launch the H100 \nFife pilot project, the world’s first 100 percent hydrogen -to-homes heating network, which is under \nconstruction today and will connect to 300 residential customers in Scotland.160 GIP also is a \nleading and early investor in offshore wind through its investments in and support of Bluepoint \nWind and Skyborn Renewables and its joint ventures with Ørsted.161 As explained by Witness \nBram, other GIP portfolio companies helping move into the energy transition include Vena Energy \n(solar, wind, and battery storage), Clearway Energy (one of the largest owners of clean energy \ngeneration assets in the United States, including utility -scale, wind, solar, and storage as well as \ncommunity and distributed solar), Eolian (leading battery storage developer in the United States), \nAtlas Renewables (battery storage and solar projects), and Chile Renovables (focused on large -\nscale renewable energy assets).162 \n \n158 Ex.

CPP Investments  has Relevant Experience and Expertise . \nSimilarly, CPP Investments has substantial experience investing in regulated and \nunregulated infrastructure, including investments in the energy sector and related to the energy \ntransition. As CPP Investments Witness Alley explains, its prior investment in  Puget Sound Energy \n(“Puget”) is a perfect example of how its expertise as an investor can provide benefits. Specifically, \na significant factor in CPP Investments’ decision to invest in Puget was the substantial capital \nplans that Puget needed to fund, whi ch would have been challenging for Puget in the public equity \nmarkets.163 CPP Investments and its partners provided the necessary capital for Puget to regularly \nmeet its clean energy targets as part of satisfying Washington state clean energy requirements .164 \nIn addition to meeting its clean energy targets, during the period in which CPP Investments was \nan upstream owner of Puget, Puget maintained customer rates below inflation165 and saw \nsubstantial improvements and outperformed Bureau of Labor Statistics utility industry averages.166 \nIn short, CPP Investments acquired Puget with other investors, provided the necessary access to \nequity capital and strategic advice for Puget to succeed, and then, as Witness Alley explains, “got \nout of the way to let the utility do what it does best —serve customers in a safe, reliable and cost -\nefficient manner.”167 No party in this proceeding has provided any evidence to indicate that CPP \nInvestments’ acquisition of Puget was anything but a success for Puget, its customers and CPP \nInvestments. CPP Investments simply seeks to do the same with its acquisition of ALLET E. \nWhile CPP Investments’ experience as an owner of Puget is the most directly relevant \nexample to the Acquisition, CPP Investments has other long -term infrastructure investments that \n \n163 Ex.

As explained by Witness \nAlley, in 2010 CPP Investments initially invested approximately Australian $440 million in \nNorthWestern Roads Group, an Australian company, that today owns two major toll roads in \nSydney.168 Since that time, CPP Investments has committed approximately Australian $700 \nmillion in follow -on capital to expand the road network.169 Similarly, CPP Investments has held \nits investment in Grupo Constanera, the largest toll road owner and operator in Chile, since 2012, \nand has continued to support the company expansion of the road network in Santiago, Chile, by \nforgoing dividends as need ed to drive growth.170 These long -term investments demonstrate that \nCPP Investments is committed to supporting the success of investments, including by infusing \nfollow -on equity capital and forgoing dividends to fund growth, just as the Partners are proposing \nto do with ALLETE.  \nFinally, CPP Investments is invested in portfolio companies in the United States that are \nfocused on the development and operation of renewable energy projects and the energy transition. \nFor example, as Witness Alley explained, CPP Investments’ portfolio i ncludes ownership interests \nin Pattern Energy Group LP (“Pattern”) and Cordelio Partners LP (“Cordelio”).171 Pattern \ndevelops, constructs, owns and operates high -quality wind, solar, transmission and energy storage \nprojects across North America, including 30  operating facilities totaling approximately 6 GW of \ninstalled capacity, and 29 GW of projects currently in development and active construction \nglobally.172 In addition, Witness Alley explained that Pattern develops and constructs significant \ntransmission projects, such as SunZia Transmission, LLC’s ongoing development of two \n \n168 Ex.

The Partners ’ Experience and Expertise are Meaningful and Impactful . \nThe Partners’ experience and track record in regulated and unregulated infrastructure \ninvesting is directly relevant to the Company and a material benefit of the Acquisition. In short, \nthe Partners have substantial experience investing in regulated and unr egulated electric and other \nutilities, transmission developers and projects, renewable energy companies focused on the energy \ntransition, and other significant infrastructure, all of which are areas of focus for the Company. \nThe Partners’ experience in the se areas will only serve to benefit ALLETE and its customers.  \nFurthermore, the Partners have seen and supported other companies through critical issues \nMinnesota Power will face, including not only the need for access to efficient, reliable capital and \ncapex management, but also support for equipment maintenance, pro curement and supply chain \nissues and strategy (which are particularly relevant in a world with evolving tariff requirements), \ncybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. As detailed above, the Partners also know first -hand the \nimportance of investor suppor t when pursuing innovative technologies and approaches to the \nenergy transition and other emerging needs. Importantly, the Partners also understand the \nregulatory compact and how these challenges are subject to , and must be addressed within , a \nregulatory process that is focused on customers and the long -term success of the portfolio \ncompany. Board members selected by the Partners will be able to call on that extensive experience \nif and when the Company faces challenges in pursuing similar pro jects.  \n \n173 Ex.

For example, \nthe Company has relationships with lenders that to date have been sufficient to s upport the \nCompany’s business.175 But the Partners have access to a broader set of lenders and they will \ncontinue to actively cultivate those and other relationships.176 Those relationships can make a \nsignificant difference when debt markets become tight, such as during a time of economic \nuncertainty and downturn, and lenders are choosing what borrowers and investments to support.   \nThe same can be true for other markets as well.  In general, given the nature and size of the \nPartners’ investments in the energy infrastructure industry, the amount of equipment, financing, \nand other support those portfolio companies require from the mark etplace far exceeds the \nCompany’s, and the Partners’ relationships in the industry are broader and they command greater \nbuying power, which Company management would have the ability to leverage to support its \nneeds. As explained by Witness Bram, this can s upport the Company’s “procurement needs from \ndevelopment to operations.”177  Witness Bram testified:  \nFor example, GIP maintains strong relationships with wind, solar and storage \nequipment OEMs and construction contractors, helping portfolio companies secure \nbest-in-class equipment and services and navigate supply chain disruptions (tariffs, \nscarcity, geop olitical, etc.) when identified by management. GIP’s global network \nof renewables and energy portfolio companies facilitate the sharing of industry best \npractices, which can help our partners reduce supply chain risk and optimize capital \ndeployment. GIP’s experience supporting the supply chains of several large \nrenewables developers is closely aligned with ALLETE’s business plan and needs \nin the coming years.178 \n \n \n175 Ex.

As detailed above, GIP was an early and leading investor in offshore wind and has supported \nportfolio companies undertaking new and innovative technologies and strategies, such as the H100 \nFife pilot project for the first conversion of a le gacy natural gas system to use hydrogen (SGN).179 \nThe Partners look forward to the opportuni ty, if the Acquisition is approved, to share with \nmanagement the Partners’ extensive experience and expertise supporting other portfolio \ncompanies’ successful growth, including the development of renewable energy, transmission and \nother advanced energy tec hnologies at the heart of the energy transition. These are material \nbenefits not available to the Company today through the public market. At a time of great need for \ncreative solutions and approaches to meet the State of Minnesota’s Carbone Free Standard,  it will \nbe a profound benefit to have the support of the Partners and access to their expertise and industry \nrelationships.  \n4. Opposing Parties Fail to Understand the Significance of the Partners ’ \nExperience and Expertise . \nOpposing Parties dismiss or minimize the importance of the Partners’ experience and \nexpertise, but do so in mutually inconsistent ways, neither of which is accurate.   \n \n179 Such as a pilot program for the first conversion of a legacy natural gas system to use hydrogen (Scotia Gas), the \nfirst liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) facility to use electric motors powered by renewable energy instead of gas -fired \nmotors to, in combinatio n with the potential use of carbon capture and sequestration, achieve the lowest carbon \nfootprint of LNG facilities in North America, and the installation of the first battery storage project in Texas to source \ntax equity . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 47 \n The Department argues that the Partners’ expertise is not a meaningful benefit because the \nPartners do not plan to change the current management or operations at the Company.180 In \nparticular, the Department expressed a desire for “operational cost cutting or improved \nprocurement processes,”181 and does not see a material benefit from access to any additional \nknowledge, experience, or relationships of the Partners. Without some designed change to \nmanagement or operations, the Department argues that “access to the Partners’ expertise is not a \nmeaningful benefit that might arise from the Acquisition.”182 The Department’s expert witnesses \ndo not have the experience to support this sweeping conclusion, as they do not have relevant \nexperience in developing investment plans, financing them, or operating a business. The more \nqualified witnesses —the people who are responsible for guiding the Company —disagree and do \nfind benefit from the Partners’ expertise.  \nIn sharp contrast to the Department, the OAG believes the Partners’ expertise presents \nsome potential benefits but also risks, and specifically requested commitments related to \nleveraging the Partners’ expertise for the benefit of the public interest.183 Witness Lebens identified \nstatements regarding  of the types of approaches GIP generally considers when investing in a \nportfolio company and based on those general statements and a misinterpretation of an information \nrequest response,184 Witness Lebens concludes that at least GIP [HCTS INFORMATION \n \n180 Ex.

As explained above, \nthe Partners’ expertise comes from their experience as investors and through their relationships in \nindustries relevant to the future growth and success of the Company. The Partners do not intend to \nmake any operational changes with respect to ALLETE or Minnesota Power, which in itself \nreflects the Partners’ experience and expertise in the sector. The Partners understand that the way \nin which they can add the most value and expertise is by ensuring capital is available to fund \nexpenditures and improvements while also supporting and empowering a successful management \nteam to achieve its goals. There is no evidence in the record that the Partners intend anything to \nthe contrary, much less are planning the types of changes speculated on by Witness Lebens.  \nD. The Acquisition Provides Benefits by Ensuring Continuity of the Company ’s \nExisting Values . \nAs stated, under Minnesota law, the Commission must find that the Acquisition is \n“consistent with the public interest,”186 which does not require an affirmative finding of public \nbenefit.187 One of the benefits of the Acquisition is that the Partners have made numerous \ncommitments intended to preserve Minnesota Power’s and ALLETE’s values and the quality of \ntheir operations.188  \n \n185 Ex.

The Partners have committed \nto defer to Minnesota Power to maintain culture, relationships, and overall appro ach to \noperations.189 More specifically, the Partners have committed to maintain company headquarters \nin Duluth, Minnesota, have committed that the ALLETE Board of Directors will include a member \nfrom each of Minnesota and Wisconsin, and have committed to ma intain the current senior \nmanagement team.190 There will be no reduction to Minnesota Power’s affordability program, or \nto Minnesota Power’s contributions to the Minnesota Power Foundation.191 With respect to labor, \nthe Partners have made a series of strong commitments to maintain the status quo, including \nmaintaining positions, compensation, and benefits for nonunion employees for two years; honoring \nexisting collective bargaining agreements; and maintaining agreements with IBEW, Local 31.192 \nThe Partners have committed that there will be no change to Minnesota Power’s contracting \npractices.193 They have committed to continue publishing a corporate sustainability report.194 And \nthey have committed to maintain the historical level of economic development.195  \nOpposing Parties seem to doubt the value of these commitments, but do not acknowledge \nall of the context.  In the cross examination of Witness Cady, counsel for OAG elicited testimony \nto confirm that these commitments did not represent a change, but a continuation of the status quo. \nThe implication of this line of questioning is that these commitments do not re present benefits of \nthe transaction because Minnesota Power and ALLETE were already implementing them pre -\n \n189 Tr.

That, of course, is not the analysis. The Acquisition provides a benefit because  it will  \nmaintain the status quo in these areas. If the Acquisition is not approved, there is no guarantee that \nthe Company  will be able to maintain its traditional culture and values . The Partners’ commitments \nto maintain the status quo in these areas is a significant benefit because it ensures that these benefits \nwill not be lost .   \nThese commitments are also a benefit of this Acquisition because there is no guarantee that \nthey would be given in a different transaction.  As Company Witness Scissons testified, in the \nabsence of the Acquisition by the Partners, one  alternative would be a n acquisition by a strategic \npurchaser, such as another utility headquartered in another state.196 Such strategic acquirer  would \nlikely seek to create synergies , identify ing and eliminat ing redundancies , cutting jobs, moving the \nheadquarters, and changing the culture and makeup of Minnesota Power .197 Further, a strategic \ninvestor likely would not have the same ability as the Partners to provide patient capital to \nALLETE in furtherance of ALLETE’s goals going  forward.198 \nCompany Witness Scissons also testified about the alternative scenario that ALLETE \nremain a public company absent the Acquisition . If ALLETE remains a public company, according \nto Company Witness Scissons, “it would be highly unlikely the Company could achieve its carbon \nfree goals as planned and other system investment (e.g., grid resilience investments and \nenhancements) would also be threatened.”199 In addition, as a public company, ALLETE could be \nvulnerable to intervention by activist investors, whose goa ls may not align with ALLETE’s and \nMinnesota Power’s goals. As Company Witness Scissions explained, “the need for the Company \nto raise capital is well known,” there has already been “a material turnover in the Company’s \n \n196 Ex.

The fact that the Partners have committed to doing so is a tangible benefit \nof the Acquisition, because it ensures that ALLETE and Minnesota Power will not be forced to \nchange.  \nE. The Commission ’s Authority Will Be Fully Maintained and Expanded by the \nAcquisition . \nThe Acquisition is also consistent with the public interest because it will ensure that the \nCommission maintains its existing authority over Minnesota Power’s operations and, in fact, will \ngive the Commission additional authority over the utility based on its new structure and ownership.  \nThe Partners fully recognize the obligation that comes with owning a regulated utility in \nMinnesota, and are fully committed to the regulatory compact and the Commission’s authority , as \ndemonstrated through the Partners’ previous and ongoing investments in regulated utilities \n \n200 Ex.

As explained by Witness Bram:  \nThe regulatory compact speaks to the utility’s right obligation to \nserve customers in return for  a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable \nreturn on prudent investments, all of which are governed and \noverseen by the applicable regulatory commission. Regulation \nbenefits both the public and investors. For investors, the regulatory \ncompact is a positive fe ature of utility operations because it helps \nprovide stability and ensure long -term, stable returns …. . That \nbenefit comes with regulatory requirements as wel l, and those \nregulatory requirements, which are determined and enforced by \napplicable regulatory agencies like the Commission, help ensure the \npublic is sufficiently protected from any adverse  effects of private \nownership of utilities.208 \n \nCPP Investments reflects the same values. Witness Alley testified:  \nCPP Investments understands that Minnesota Power is a closely \nregulated public utility. The Commission will continue to set rates \nand key strategic decisions will require approval from the \nCommission after the Acquisition, and its regulatory authority will  \nbe unchanged.209 \n \nCPP Investments’ prior history includes a long-term investment in Puget Sound , which included \nproviding funding for Puget Sound’s extensive ongoing investments in renewable resources, to \nassist Puget Sound  in facing challenges quite similar to the challenges being faced by Minnesota \nPower.210 \nEach of the Partners understands the regulatory compact, and welcomes it. The Partners’ \nextensive and successful experience in long-term investing in regulated entities provides added \nsupport for the reliability of their long-term commitments to Minnesota Power and to the \nregulatory compact with Minnesota and the Commission.    \n \n207 Ex.

The Commission currently has limited authority over ALLETE’s \nshareholders, who buy and sell shares frequently without oversight. Following the Ac quisition, \nhowever, the Commission will have substantial authority over the Partners’ investment in \nALLETE and Minnesota Power . \nWhile the Partners have no specific plans to sell their interests in Minnesota Power , if they \ndo so, any sale would be subject to review and approval by the Commission. The Commission \nwould have full authority to review the transaction, and the proposed future owners, and to place \nconditions necessary to ensure the sale is in the public interest. Each of the Partners are fully aware \nof the Commission’s authority over future sales and understand that Commission approval would \nbe required.211 This authority ov er the Partners is an authority that the Commission does not have \nover current shareholders.  In addition, a s discussed below in Section II.J, the Commission’s \nauthority will also be maintained because the Partners have committed to transparency.  \nII. THE SPECULATIVE RISKS IDENTIFIED BY OPPOSING PARTIES DO NOT \nOUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS . \nThe Opposing Parties have raised a host of concerns about the risk that the Acquisition \ncould create. As demonstrated in this section, these concerns are speculative and not based on \nreliable evidence in the record. To the extent there are any concerns abo ut the Acquisition, those \nconcerns are mitigated by the substantial commitments made by Petitioners and are outweighed \nby the benefits.  \n \n211 Ex.

Opposing Parties ’ Concerns about “Private Equity Investors ” are Not \nSupported by the Record . \nMany of the arguments raised by  the Opposing Parties are based on their overgenera lized \nfears about what  “private equity investors” may do when they buy a company.212 These fears are \nbased on a generic understanding of “private equity investors,” sometimes literally based on \nconcerns that Opposing Parties have read about in books.213 These characterizations, and the \nresulting fears about what the Partners will or will not do, are not supported by the record , for \nseveral reasons.  \nFirst, the Partners are not stereo typical private equity investors.  While the Opposing Parties \nseek to paint all investors  as opportunistic and bad for the public interest , the record shows that \nthey did not do their homework before assigning labels and making assumptions about the \nPartners.  As explained by the Department , investors have different categories of investments, and \nthey carry different characteristics and goals.214 One category is private equity,  another is public \nequity (such as public stock mar kets). Yet another category is real assets, including  infrastructure. \nThe Opposing Parties assumed that the Partners are investing in the Company as “private equity” \ninvestors and  base many of their concerns on that assumption. In fact, the Partners have categorized \nALLETE as a real asset or infrastructure investment, and have no intention of handling the \ninvestment in ALLETE like a stereotypical  private equity investment.  \nThe record is clear  that CPP Investments has included the ALLETE investment  in its \ninfrastructure  group, which is part of its Real Assets department .215 It is also clear from the record \n \n212 See, e.g.,  Ex.

Both CPP Investments  and CalPERS  consider \nALLETE to be a Real Asset investment , not part of their private equity portfolios.  \nGIP does not make  “typical ” private equity investments.  Rather, GIP makes only long-\nterm infrastructure  investments , including long -term, stable, regulated industries like airports and \nutilities.218As a result, it is clear that, contrary to the fears conjured by  the Opposing Parties, the \nPartners are not stereo typical private equity investors. The Opposing Parties either did not do their \nresearch or chose to ignore it .219 \nSecond, in support of their fears that the Partners will conduct themselves like stereo typical \nprivate equity investor s (seeking to maximize their short -term profits to the detriment of their \nacquired company), the Opposing Parties have offered  no evidence.

The Partners know what they are doing, and have developed \nover many years an understanding of what it means to own highly regulated businesses like \nALLETE and how to do so successfully. The Opposing Parties have not identified any actions by \neither Partner  that harmed any of these entities or the customers they serve.  \nGIP’s character as an investor is verified by the testimony of LIUNA Witness Bryant.  \nWitness Bryant explained LIUNA’s long relationship with GIP:  \nGIP is a proven and highly responsible manager of infrastructure investments based \non LIUNA’s extensive experience as a participant in GIP Funds and as a \ncommunity stakeholder impacted by investments to which we are not a party. Our \nexperience has given us  confidence in GIP’s capacity, and in the credibility of the \ncommitments that are being made to regulators and stakeholders.222 \n \n \n220 This is true even for SunPower, the one investment CURE tried to use to portray GIP unfavorably.   CURE could \nnot point to any action GIP took in that situation that created the issues SunPower faced. In fact, an actual review of \nSEC filings cited by Witness Baker reveals that the issues he points to at SunPower occurred prior to  GIP’s \ninvolvement and that at the relevant time GIP held interests in a holding company that gave GIP just over 25% of the \ninterests in SunPower and only 2 of 9 board seats.   https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000867773/  \n000086777323000117/spwr -20230101.htm  (explaining the financial reporting issues for fiscal years ending January \n2021, 2022, and 2023, when GIP acquired its interests in September 2022; showing GIP had only 2 board seats and \nheld just under 50% of a holding company that itself only owned appr oximately 50.5% of SunPower). Furthermore, \nconsistent with the Sarbanes -Oxley Act and NASDAQ standards, GIP -appointed directors could not serve on the \nAudit Committee which had primary responsibility for oversight of financial reporting. See \nhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000867773/000114036123015089/ny20006690x2  \n_def14.htm  (“we comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes -Oxley Act and The Nasdaq Stock Market rules that \nrequire that our Audit Committee be composed exclusively of independent directors”).

See \nhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000867773/000086777324000069/spwr -20240530.htm  (8-K \ndetailing credit agreement for a $175.5 million term loan).   \n221 The Partners’ expertise is discussed in more detail in Section I.C.  \n222 Ex. LIUNA -851, Bryant Direct at 9, eDocket No. 20252 -214955 -01. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 58 \n The only independent, third -party witness with direct experience in working with GIP has provided \ntestimony in support of GIP’s character and reputation.  \n Third, the Partners do not have any incentive to take actions that  would  harm ALLETE  and \nhave powerful disincentives to do so  because  the long -term harm would far outweigh any short -\nterm benefit that could be achieved. The Partners are large investors who expect to make multiple \ninvestments each year. As explained by Witness Alley, any allegations of self -dealing, favoritism, \nor other negative actions, “would do far more harm to the business reputation of CPP Investments, \nboth in Minnesota and elsewhere it  does business, than any benefit that could be obtained.”223 The \nfact that the Partners chose to invest in a highly regulated business, which will receive continuous \nscrutiny from the Commission, the Department, and other stakeholders, is a sign that they have no \nintention or incentive to benefit themselves at the expense of ALLETE —any investor who had \nsuch preferences would avoid, rather than seek out, a highly regulated public utility.  \n Fourth, the Partners ’ internal documents demonstrate that their internal investment thesis \nis consistent with their overall goals and the public interest. Opposing Parties have raised much \nconcern about a handful of documents , but their concerns are primarily based on \nmisunderstandings of what the se documents are and how they should be evaluated.  The Partners’ \nfinancial valuation models provide the foundation for the information presented to their final \ndecision makers (“Investment Committees”). That infor mation is contained in memoranda (“IC \nMemos”).  IC Memos are confidential, internal documents that investors like the Partners use to \ninform their decision about whether to invest in a company. Making a $3.9 billion investment \nrequires an enormous amount of analysis and due diligence. The analysis incl udes detailed \nevaluation of potential scenarios for how the investment could, theoretically, play out in the future. \n \n223 Ex.

The IC Memos are an analysis of what could happen, not a statement of \nintention or a fully fleshed out plan.  \n Further, the content of the IC Memos serves only to confirm that the Partners ’ investment \nin ALLETE is consistent with the public interest . For example, [HCTS INFORMATION \nBEGINS …  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n [… HCTS INFORMATION ENDS] In short, the \ninvestment thesis described in CPP Investments’ internal documents is the same as explained in \nthis proceeding: ALLETE needs additional capital to help Minnesota Power decarbonize, and \nproviding that capital is a good investment opportunity f or the Partners.  \n \n224 Ex.

[HCTS \nINFORMATION BEGINS …  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n [… HCTS INFORMATION ENDS]  \nRather than focusing on these statements of the Partners’ intent, the Opposing Parties focus \non the valuation modeling in the investment documents. But the valuation models do not represent \nany specific plan. They are just an evaluation of alternative , potential  scenarios programmed into \na computer model. The outputs of those models do not represent intended plans by the Partners ; \nthey are just, as admitted during the evidentiary hearing,  “computer model[s] picking it up and \ndoing the math.”233 The fact that the Partners completed a math exercise before deciding to invest \nbillions of dollars in ALLETE should not be seen as a problem.  \n Finally, the fact that the documents are treated as Highly Confidential is not an indication \nof any problem. The IC Memos are Highly Confidential because they are highly proprietary  and \nwould cause severe damage to the Partners’ ability to compete for other investments . Even a  \n \n229 Ex.

Hearing, Vol. 2 at 640:17 –21 (Addonizio Cross).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n\n \n 61 \n cursory review of the IC Memos prepared by the Partners reveals that they include  different \ninformation presented and analyzed in different ways , and that disclosure of the information they \ncontain and even the way they are constructed could be significantly harmful . Outside of this \nAcquisition, the Partners compete with other investors for other projects, and sometimes with each \nother. Revealing the manner in which they evaluate investment opportunities to their competitors \nwould materially harm the Partne rs, which is why these critical documents are treated as \nconfidential under Minnesota  law. Despite their sensitivity, though, every Party in this proceeding \nhas access to these documents pursuant to the protective orders, as do the senior managers at \nALLETE, and both the ALJ and the Commission.  The fact that the Partners produced these \ndocuments, given their sensitivity, is a sign of their intent to provide transparency, not any ill -\nintent  to conceal information from persons who need that information . \n Ultimately, the record demonstrates that the Partners are who they say they are: \nexperienced, well -respected investors whose interests are aligned with those of ALLETE. \nOpposing Parties’ arguments to the contrary are based on exaggerations and misundersta ndings, \nnot hard evidence.  \nB. The Commission ’s Regulatory Authority Fully Protects Against Any of the \nSpeculative Risks Suggested by Opposing Parties.  \nOpposing Parties have raised a number of fears regarding actions they believe the Partners \ncould take to increase risks or that would result in harm to customers. For example, Opposing \nParties suggest that the Partners could force customers to bear the bur den of excessive rate \nincreases, unnecessary capital expenditures, and payment for premiums the Partners may receive \nfrom a future sale.234 Other Parties suggest that the Partners will change Minnesota Power’s path \n \n234 See, e.g., Ex. LPI-1001, Walters Direct at 17:21-18:3, eDocket No. 20252 -214957 -02. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 62 \n and delay or defer compliance with the Carbon Free Standard. In  making  these arguments , the \nOpposing Parties appear to have  completely discounted the greatest and most reliable protection \nfor customers: the Commission itself, and Minnesota’s robust regulatory system. There is no \nrealistic basis for the fears of the Opposing Parties, because the Commission will protect the public \ninterest and customers.  \nThe Commission closely regulates nearly every aspect of Minnesota Power’s utility \noperations. The Commission has a rigorous process for reviewing the rates of public utilities like \nMinnesota Power.235 The Commission also has rigorous processes for approving generation \nresources, transmission projects, distribution modernization projects, and other programs and \nspending proposals.236 The Commission continuously monitors the utility’s performance on \nservice quality and reliability.237 In each of these proceedings, the Commission , based on input \nfrom some of the same intervenors participating in this proceeding, is very diligent in protecting \nthe public interest. Most of the concerns raised by Opposing Parties boil down to a concern that \nthe Acquisition could, somehow, increase risks or harm customers. There  is no reason to believe \nthat the Commission —or the Parties in this case —will be any less diligent in the future . The \nCommission will continue to protect the public interest after the Acquisition, as it has done for \nmany years , and has the regulatory authority t o address any issues that do arise.  \nC. Use of Debt at Alloy Parent is Reasonable and Consistent with the Public \nInterest.  \nThe record demonstrates that debt financing related to the Acquisition and the future \noperation of ALLETE does not contravene the public interest. Certain Opposing Parties raise \n \n235 Minn. Stat. § 216B.16.  \n236 See, e.g. , Minn. Stat. §§ 216B.2422, 243.  \n237 In the Matter of Minnesota Powers 2023 Annual Safety, Reliability, and Service Quality Report , Docket No. \nE0015/M -24-29, ORDER ACCEPTING REPORTS AND SETTING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS  (Jan. 13, 2025), eDocket \nNo. 20251 -213880 -01. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 63 \n concerns regarding post -Acquisition debt. These concerns are unfounded, not only because they \nare speculative, but also because they ignore the Commission’s core regulatory functions related \nto debt and commitments made by the Petitioners in this proceedin g. \nThe Partners will utilize debt efficiently along with equity to provide needed capital to \nALLETE while maintaining strong credit metrics and the overall health of the Company, in much \nthe same way as other owners of Minnesota utilities. In fact, because of the commitments made by \nPetitioners, Minnesota Power customers would have greater  protection related to debt financing \nthan customers  of other Minnesota utilities.  The Petitioners have made commitments that: (1) \nensure the Commission has visibility into t he injection of equity capital and payment of dividends; \nand (2) further protect Minnesota Power and its customers if Minnesota Power’s credit rating is \nnot investment grade or if the dividends would cause Minnesota Power’s capital structure to be \noutside the range approved by the Commission.  \n1. Debt Held at ALLETE and Minnesota Power, or Issued to Complete the \nAcquisition is Consistent with the Public Interest.  \nAs a threshold matter it is important to distinguish the ways that debt financing are \ndiscussed in this proceeding and how they are different.  First, the Partners will issue a small \namount of debt as part of the Acquisition. As explained by GIP Witness Bram in his Direct \nTestimony,238 the Partners are using very low debt leverage to acquire ALLETE —roughly \n8 percent of the Acquisition price.  This is a very low level of leverage for any acquisition \n(regardless of the industry),239 which means that the Acquisition has materially less risk compared \nto other utility acquisitions . \n \n238  Ex. MP -14, Bram Direct at 29:1 –6, 202412 -212968 -09. \n239 Ex. MP -36, Lapson Rebuttal at 6 :25–28, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -11 (“[T]o finance the Acquisition, the \nPartners are using an unusually low amount of acquisition debt at Alloy Parent and no incremental debt at ALLETE, \nthus avoiding an initial leverage burden and demonstrating the Partners’ financial conservatism.”).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 64 \n For example, the small amount  of leverage being used by the Partners is in stark contrast \nto the TXU Corp. buyout cited by Witness Baker. That transaction involved five times more debt \nthan equity ($40.1 billion of debt compared to $8 billion of equity) or roughly 83% of the \nacquisition price.240 The risks associated with the TXU transaction were dramatically different and \nare not applicable to the Acquisition or indicative of the likelihood of debt -related difficulties for \nthe Company.241 \nIn addition, the record demonstrates that there are no issues related to debt at ALLETE and \nMinnesota Power. That is so because the capital structures (including equity and debt ratios) of \nALLETE and Minnesota Power are regulated by the Commission at two l evels. The Commission \nclosely evaluates and establishes the amount of debt and equity that can be included in the \nregulated utility’s capital structure for setting rates.242 This regulation directly affects customer \nrates. Additionally, utilities also must s eek approval for their actual capital structure and must \npropose to the Commission a ratio of equity to debt, as well as a contingency range for that ratio, \nand limits on both short -term and long -term debt.243 This regulation does not directly affect \ncustomer rates but places limits on the financing of the utility. The Commission engages in both \nof these functions as it relates to Minnesota Power (through rate cases) and ALLETE (through \ncapital structure filing s). As a result, if the Acquisition is approved, the levels of debt at Minnesota \nPower (for ratemaking) and ALLETE (for capital structure) will continue to be closely regulated \n \n240 Ex. CURE -600, Baker Direct at 10 –11, eDocket No. 20252 -214963 -04. \n241 In another effort by Opposing Parties to portray the Partners in a negative light, Witness Baker asserts that the \nclaim that “the Acquisition itself will use very low debt leverage” is “misleading.” Ex. CURE -602, Baker Surrebuttal \nat 14:6 -15:9, eDocket No.  20253 -21681 9-03. That is not the case. Debt obtained to complete the Acquisition will be \nvery low, and the statement that “the Acquisition itself will use very low debt leverage” is a fact that cannot be \nreasonably disputed. The extent to which Alloy Parent includes  debt in its future capital structure is a separate issue, \naddress in the next subsection.  \n242 See Minn. Stat. § 216B.16.  \n243 Minn. Stat. § 216B.49; see Tr. Evid. Hearing, Vol. 2 at 514:4 -517:22  (Addonizio  Cros s) (discussing capital \nstructure approval requirements and filings for Minnesota Power).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 65 \n by the Commission. Department Witness Addonizio concedes this will remain the same if the \nAcquisition is approved.244 \nThis regulation is a meaningful tool to address any concerns regarding debt at Minnesota \nPower. CURE Witness Baker argues in his Direct Testimony that “private equity and private \ninfrastructure managers often use significant amounts of debt to acquire comp anies and often add \nadditional debt to acquired companies’ … balance sheets while they own them.”245  This does not \napply to the Acquisition because the Partners cannot add additional debt to ALLETE’s capital \nstructure without Commission approval.  \n2. The Use of Post-Acquisition Debt will be Reasonable and Consistent with \nCommon Utility Practice.  \nAnother concern raised by Opposing Parties is the use of post -Acquisition debt not at the \nCompany level, but at the “holding company” level, i.e., at Alloy Parent. For example, the \nDepartment is concerned that the use of debt at the holding company is the type of “financial \nengineering” the Partners will use to the detriment of the Company and its customers.246 None of \nthese concerns are supported by the record.  Even if they were present, they would be effectively \nmitigated by the Commitments made by the Pet itioners.   \na) It is Standard Practice for Utility Holding Companies like Alloy \nParent to Include Debt Financing of Equity Investments in Utility \nSubsidiaries.  \nMany utility holding companies, including those that own Minnesota Public utilities, \nutilize debt capital to finance their operations. As a result, concerns about the concept of using \ndebt financing at Alloy Parent are unwarranted.  \n \n244 Tr. Evid. Hearing , Vol. 2 at 509:9 -17 (Addonizio Cross).  \n245 Ex. CURE -600, Baker Direct at 4:12 -17, eDocket No. 20252 -214963 -04. \n246 Ex. DOC -303, Addonizio Direct at 66 , eDocket No. 20252 -214941 -01. Company Witness Bulkley testified, \nhowever, that in her view the use of debt financing at a holding company level does not constitute “financial \nengineering.”  Tr. Evid. Hearing, Vol. 2  at 367 (Bulk ley Cross ). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 66 \n Public records demonstrate that other Minnesota utilit y holding compan ies make use of \ndebt financing, including the other investor -owned electric utilities Northern States Power \nCompany (“NSPM”) and Otter Tail Power Company (“OTP”), and the gas utility CenterPoint \nEnergy. NSPM’s parent company, Xcel Energy Inc . has approximately 60 percent debt in its \noverall capital structure.247 OTP’s parent company, Otter Tail Corporation has approximately 40 \npercent debt in its overall capital structure.248 CenterPoint’s parent company, CenterPoint Energy \nInc., includes approximately 65 percent debt in its overall capital structure.249 Each of the operating \nutilities —NSPM, OTP, and CenterPoint —receive all of their equity capital infusions from their \nparent companies,250 which are financed partially by debt. Neither the debt financing, nor the use \nof that financing to infuse equity into the operating, is new or problematic.  \nThe Department is aware of this situation and has not identified any problems with it in the \npast. The Department reviewed Xcel Energy Inc.’s capital structure data as part of the 2024 NSPM \ncapital structure filing, and specifically included a table demons trating that Xcel Energy Inc. \nincludes debt in its capital structure.251 In fact, the Department included a table of 35 publicly \ntraded utility holding companies and every single one uses debt financing, including Xcel Energy \nInc., Otter Tail Corporation, Ce nterPoint Energy, and WEC Energy Group —the holding \ncompanies for most of the utility companies in the state.252 The average percentage of debt in the \ncapital structure of these holding companies is approximately 58.5 percent.253 The Department did \n \n247 Ex.

The Commission approved \nNSPM’s capital structure filing on March 21, 2025 , consistent with the Department’s \nrecommendation.254  \nNo Opposing Party has explained any reason why it is a problem for Alloy Parent to use \ndebt financing when it is not a problem for the other utilities in Minnesota. In fact, the \nDepartment’s position in this proceeding is entirely inconsistent with its ana lysis of Minnesota \nPower’s most recent capital structure petition, where it stated: “[T]he Department is primarily \ninterested in Minnesota Power’s regulated capital structure, rather than ALLETE’s overall capital \nstructure. In reviewing ALLETE’s capital st ructure as proposed in the Petition, the Department’s \nintentions are to ensure that Minnesota Power’s jurisdictional capital structure is reasonable and \nallow ALLETE the flexibility to finance its non -regulated operations as it sees fit subject to the \nconstraint that the Company’s ratepayers cannot be unreasonably harmed by those operations .”255 \nThe potential capital structure of Alloy Parent should be evaluated consistent with the current \nregulatory practice . \nFurther, the Department  has specifically acknowledged that all companies have a \nhypothetical “best” capital structure that includes some debt.256 The Department admitted in an \ninformation request response that this theory would apply to Alloy Parent as well.257 The fact that \ndebt financing is standard practice is also recognized by the academic literature the Department  \n \n254 In the Matter of the Petition of Northern States Power Company for Approval of Capital Structure for Issuance of \nLong -Term and Short -Term Securities for 2025 , Docket No. E -002/S -24-368, Consent Order (Mar. 21, 2025), eDocket \nNo. 20253 -216683 -01. \n255 Ex MP -50 at 2 , eDocket No. 20254 -217287 -04. \n256 Ex.

Those plans are intended to achieve an optimal capital structure —\nas explained by the Department —that will minimize the overall cost of capital for Alloy Parent.260 \nAt the outset, the record is clear that any debt issued by Alloy Parent would be the \nresponsibility of Alloy Parent and not ALLETE. The Partners have committed that all debt issued \nat Alloy Parent would be non -recourse to ALLETE, meaning that it is not sec ured by utility assets \nand ALLETE would have no obligation to repay the debt under any circumstances.261 \n \n258 The Department criticizes Witness Alley, arguing that he did not “offer any explanation or analysis of how or why \nthe increased use of non -regulated debt is ‘more efficient .’” Ex. DOC -304, Addonizio Surrebuttal at 39:14 -24, eDocket \nNo. 20253 -216799 -01. This criticism reflects a misunderstanding about financing theory and is inconsistent with the \nsources cited in the Department’s testimony. For example,  Figure 3 from Witness Addonizio’s Direct Testimony was \ntaken from  a textbook by Roger Morin , who —in the same book — noted “the existence of an optimal capital structure \nwhereby the cost of capital is minimized,” and terming this point “the optimal, or cost -efficient, capital structure \npoint.”  Ex. DOC -303, Addonizio Direct at 1 7:1-3, eDocket No. 20252 -214941 -01 (citing Roger A Morin., NEW \nREGULATORY FINANCE at 455 (2006) ). \n259 Ex.

[T]he general principles illustrated in the figure apply to Alloy Parent. As Alloy P arent’s \ndebt ratio increases, its cost of debt and equity will rise, and theoretically, there is an optimal capital structure that \nwould minimize its capital structure.”).  \n260 See id.  \n261 Ex.

There is also nothing in the record substantiating Oppos ing Parties’ concerns that future \ndebt incurred at Alloy Parent could cause, or even materially increase the risks of, any of the ill \neffects feared by the Opposing Parties .

Ex. CURE -602, Baker Surrebuttal at 14 , eDocket No. 20253 -216819 -03. This \nanalysis is misleading  because  it ignores the fact that by 2035, ALLETE will be a significantly larger company with \nmaterially different financials , much higher cashflow, and comparatively  higher dividend potential.  Witness Baker \nalso ignores what will happen without the Acquisition.  If ALLETE remains a publicly traded entity, it would be \nexpected to issue over $1 billion in dividends over the next five years alone . Ex.

That cannot happen here, because Minnesota Power needs \napproval from the Commission to issue debt securities. The Commis sion would never authorize \nthe issuance of debt by the utility just to finance a dividend.   \nThere is also no indication in the record that the Partners intend to engage in dividend \nrecapitalization, even if it were possible. As discussed above in Section II.A, the valuation models \nto which the Opposing Parties point do not reflect any specific plans of the Partners.274 The \nOpposing Parties’ attempts to isolate specific potential scenarios in these valuation models to \nsuggest the Partners  have any specific intent  reflect  a misunderstanding of the models . They are \nsimply  computer models that are automated to add debt as needed to maintain the ratios discussed \nabove and calculate dividends when additional cash is available, but they do not reflect  a specific  \n“plan.”  \nOpposing Parties ’ efforts to support this argument with a cash flow analysis are of limited \nvalue because the analysis is based on arbitrary comparisons, not the type of analysis conducted \nby ratings agencies .275 It is also based on the incorrect assumption that it is a problem for debt \nissuances and dividends to occur in the same year. In fact, that is a routine business practice —\nALLETE is  currently  paying out a quarterly dividend four times a year,  which means that there \nare always dividends every time ALLETE issues debt . The two things are not directly related, and \nare not indicative of the concerns raised by Witness Baker.  \nOpposing Parties also briefly discuss the concept of double leverage, and particularly the \npossibility that the use of double leverage could negatively impact ALLETE’s credit rating.276 As \n \n274 Ex.

The only way \nto be sure that debt issued by a parent is not infused as equity to a subsidiary would be to use no \ndebt at all.  \nFinancing Alloy Parent without any debt would not be consistent with the financing theory \nlaid out by  the Department. As discussed above,  every business —including Alloy Parent —has an \noptimal capital structure that will result in the lowest cost of capital, and which includes some debt \nand some equity.278 Financing the business entirely from equity would result in less efficient \nfinancing than is optimal, and would serve only to make it more expensive for the Partners to \nprovide the capital that Minnesota Powe r needs.   \nAs noted above, the use of debt financing is a  standard  industry practice.  In fact, the \nDepartment provided specific analysis about the possible benefits of debt financing.279 While \nOpposing Parties  argues that the benefits of debt financing are outweighed by risk at some point, \nno Opposing Party  has done any analysis about the point at which the benefits of using debt would \nbe outweighed by the risk.  As explained above, the Partners intend to manage the amount of debt \nat Alloy Parent at a level that is consistent with industry standards and target investment grade \ncredit metrics , which means that there is very limited risk from the use of debt financing.  \n \n277 Ex.

And close regulation by the Commission \nis more than sufficient to protect the utility from any concerns related to dividend recapitalization.  \n3. Petitioners ’ Commitments Ensure that any Risks related to Debt Financing \nare Mitigated.  \nIn general, Opposing Parties argue that the use of debt financing at Alloy Parent could \nharm ALLETE and Minnesota Power customers by creating pressure to increase cash flow, or \nnegatively impact the Company’s credit ratings.280 As explained above, these fears are not \nsupported by evidence. But even if they were, the Petitioners have proposed a series of \ncommitments that mitigate any concerns related to debt financing.  \na) The Petitioners ’ Commitments Protect the Cash Flow at ALLETE.  \nOpposing Parties worry that large debt loads at Alloy Parent will put pressure on cash flow \nat the Company, either as direct debt service (due to higher borrowing costs at ALLETE), or \ndividend pressure (to service debt at Alloy Parent).   \nTo ensure the financial viability of ALLETE remains protected, the Partners have \ncommitted that they cannot receive dividends if ALLETE does not have an investment grade credit \nrating.281 This ensures that dividends to Alloy Parent do not negatively impact ALLETE’s credit \nratings or Minnesota Power’s financing costs. In addition, the Partners have committed that they \nwill not receive any dividends that would cause Minnesota Power to be out  of compliance with its \nrequired capital structure, ensuring that the utility is financed consistent with Commission \n \n280 Ex.

The Department argues this could put pressure on the Company’s credit \nrating, potentially increasing the cost of debt and therefore higher cost of capital. While that \nincrease would not be passed on to customers given the hold -harmless  provision discussed below, \nthe Department  is concerned there are other “negative real -world implications associated with that \nrisk.”287   \nThe Partners have made a number of commitments that will ensure that the Company will \nremain rated and will reduce pressure on applicable credit ratings:  \n• ALLETE will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its current corporate and \nfacility ratings.288 \n \n• ALLETE will use commercially reasonable efforts to remain rated by at least two credit \nrating agencies.289 \n \n• Minnesota Power will continue to provide ALLETE credit rating reports to the \nCommission within 30 days of receipt of the reports from the rating agencies.290 \n \n• Minnesota Power will be prohibited from loaning funds to or borrowing funds from its \nAlloy parent or other upstream entities.291 \n \n• Alloy Parent will not use utility assets to guarantee Alloy Parent debt.292 \n \nThese commitments are practical and effective ways to ensure the Petitioners do not engage in \nharmful debt -related practices the Opposing Parties believe create risk because the commitments \naddress the ultimate impact of those behaviors.293   \n \n287 Ex. DOC -303, Addonizio Surrebuttal at 41 , eDocket No. 20253 -216799 -01. \n288 Ex. MP -27, Cady Rebuttal, Schedule 1, Commitment 6, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -03. Opposing Parties have \nexpressed concern that this commitment does not go further than offering “commercially reasonable efforts.”  \nHowever, because credit ratings depend on numerous factors that are and always will be outside the rated entity’s \ncontrol, i t is not possible for any entity to affirmatively commit to maintain a specific rating.  \n289 Id. Commitment 7.  \n290 Id. Commitment  38. \n291 Id. Commitment 38.  \n292 Id. Commitment 9.  \n293 These commitments are more practical and effective than attempting to expressly address or prohibit all the possible \nbusiness decisions  the Opposing Parties find create risk.  Attempting to craft commitments to address every possible \ntype or cause of business risk would not only result in unreasonable limitations on the Company’s and Alloy Parent’s \nabilities to operate, but would be impos sible.   \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 78 \n  As discussed above, the Partners have also committed not to receive dividends unless \nALLETE maintains an investment -grade credit rating. This commitment is likely to be viewed  by \nratings agencies as credit protective  and a benefit to the Company’s credit rating. Any perceived \nrisks to the Company’s credit ratings must be viewed in context with other commitments that could \nsupport credit ratings.  \nd) The Petitioners ’ Commitments Protect against Pressure on Rates. \nFinally, Opposing Parties expressed concern that debt at the Company or Alloy Parent \nlevels could increase the cost of debt for Minnesota Power, increasing customers’ rates.  For the \nreasons explained above, the Acquisition will not result in levels or typ es of debt that will put \npressure on the Company’s credit ratings such that investors will require a higher cost of debt.  \nHowever, Petitioners make the following commitment to address this concern and provide an \nadditional layer of certainty that customer s’ rates will not increase as a result of debt caused by the \nAcquisition:  \n• If Minnesota Power’s cost of debt increases above current levels within three  years \nfollowing the close of the Acquisition, Minnesota ratepayers will be held  harmless from \nany rate impact unless Minnesota Power can demonstrate that  its increased cost of debt \nwas not caused by the Acquisition.294 \n \nIf the use of debt financing at Alloy Parent does cause any negative impacts at the utility —which \nis very unlikely —the Petitioners have committed that customers will be held harmless from such \ncost impacts. Even if there are negative impacts, they will not  be included in customer rates. If the \nAcquisition results in lower borrowing costs going forward, they will be incorporated into reduced \nrates in a future rate case.  \n \n294 Ex. MP -27, Cady Rebuttal, Schedule 1, Commitment 5, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -03. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 79 \n In combination, these commitments ensure that any potential risks related to debt financing \nare mitigated and that customers are fully protected.  \n4. The Cost of Minnesota Power ’s Debt Financing May Increase if the \nAcquisition is Not Approved.   \nThere is one genuine risk that the record does support but that the Opposing Parties fail to \nconsider.  In their enthusiasm  to find risks associated with the Acquisition, Opposing Parties fail \nto consider and address the risks to Minnesota Power and its customers if the Acquisition is not \napproved.  As Company Witness Taran explained, there are significant risks of a credit downgrade \nand cost of debt increase if the Acquisition does not close.295 Indeed, given ALLETE’s significant \nneed for capital, the curren t market uncertainty surrounding several key customers, the historic \nvolatility of the public equity market, and the signal it would send to the market if the Acquisition \nis not approved, the most profound risks to ALLETE, its credit rating, and its cost o f capital, and \nthus the most clear and profound risk to Minnesota Power’s customers, would come from failure \nto approve the Acquisition.  \nD. The Partners ’ Projected Investment Returns Are Reasonable.  \n Several Opposing Parties raise concerns that the Partners expect to earn a return on their \ninvestment in ALLETE and Minnesota Power, and that the Partners’ plans for doing so might \ncreate risks or inflict harms on customers.296 Some Opposing Parties raise related concerns that \nthe Partners might, at some point, sell their ownership in ALLETE and Minnesota Power.297 \nIt is true that the Partners, like any investor including existing shareholders, hope to earn a \nreturn on their investment in ALLETE. But that return will not harm customers and, in fact, is \n \n295 Ex. MP -11, Taran Direct at  17:3-14, eDocket No. 202412 -212968 -05; Ex.

Substantial evidence in the record demonstrates that the Partners do not \nhave any plan —or even any ability —to increase their returns in a way that harms customers. \nSubstantial evidence also demonstrates that, if the Partners do decide to sell their investm ent at \nsome time in the future, such a process will not harm customers  because the Commission can and \nwill protect Minnesota Power cust omers .  \n1. The Opposing Parties Do Not Understand the Financial Evaluations \nPerformed by the Partners . \nThe first error made by Opposing Parties is to confuse the Partners’ due diligence financial \nevaluation s that are presented to their respective Investment Committees as some sort of over -\narching plan for ALLETE. In particular, Opposing Parties point to the Partners’ IC Memos  as \nevidence that the Partners intend to take advantage of ALLETE to increase their returns.298 These \narguments demonstrate that the Opposing Parties do not understand what the IC Memos are , or for \nwhat they are used.  \nAs explained above, an IC Memo  is a tool that sophisticated  investors use to evaluate \nwhether to make an investment. As part of that evaluation, it should be no surprise that investors \ntry to estimate what return they could expect to receive. Just as a prudent person would compare \nthe potential return on different stocks or mutual funds before making an investment, investors \nlike the Partners evaluate and compare the potential return on investments like ALLETE.  \nThat evaluation involves inputting a series of assumptions, forecasts, and other data into a \nvaluation model.299 The valuation model then outputs an estimated level of return that could be \nexpected based on the inputs. The fact that the valuation model resulted in an expected return of \n \n298 See, e.g. , Ex. DOC -303, Addonizio HCTS Direct at 63 –64, eDocket No. 20252 -214942 -01. \n299 See, e.g. , Ex.

To the contrary, the analys es were primarily used \nto evaluate what return s the Partners might expect from their investment in ALLETE based on \ncontinuation of ALLETE ’s existing plans.   \n2. The Partners’ Analyses  Do Not Assume Increased Returns  on Equity  for \nMinnesota Power . \nThe Partners’ valuation models, and the potential returns they calculated, are not based on \nany increase in the returns on equity (“ ROE s”) for Minnesota Power.  Opposing Parties raise \nconcerns that [HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n \n … HCTS INFORMATION ENDS]300 In making this \nargument, the Opposing Parties confuse the authorized ROE established by the Commission with \nthe total investment return  on the acquisition of ALLETE estimated by the Partners . The total \ninvestment return is not based only on annual returns from ROEs  but also includes any increase to \nthe value of ALLETE.  That increase in value is directly and primarily dependent on  ensuring that \nMinnesota Power remains a well -run utility providing high quality, affordable service while \nsuccessfully decarbonizing its system.    \nThe record demonstrates that [HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n  \n \n300 See, e.g. , Ex.

The \nPartners recognize that the Commission will set the authorized ROEs for Minnesota Power, and \ntheir IC Memo valuation models simply made reasonable assumptions about what the ROE might \nbe so that the Partners could evaluate whether to invest in ALLETE.  \nAs discussed throughout this Brief, the IC Memo valuation models are based on additional \nreasonable assumptions, including those related to capital structure, debt ratios, and the theories \nby which the value of ALLETE and Minnesota Power will increase.    \n3. The Potential  Investment Returns Estimated in Valuat ion Models are \nPrimarily Based on Increasing the Value of the Company, which is \nConsistent with the Public Interest . \nThe potential investment returns estimated in the Partners’ valuation models is based \nprimarily on increasing the value of the Company, which in turn rests primarily on successful \ngrowth and operation at Minnesota Power. Increasing the value of Minnesota Power —subject to \nclose regulation by the Commission —is in the public interest, and , as a result , the potential returns \nestimated by the Partners should not be a cause for concern.  \nAs explained by Witness Bram, “We anticipate that through additional investments by and \ncontinued successful management at ALLETE, including continued cooperation and compliance \nwith the Commission and its policies, over time the value of ALLETE will incre ase.”307 Witness \n \n307 Ex.

For example, \nCPP Investments conducts an annua l evaluation of the market value of its investments, including \nALLETE, referred to as mark -to-market accounting.308  \nWitness Alley further explained how ALLETE’s value rests heavily on Minnesota Power’s \noverall success in providing high quality service at reasonable rates while also meeting the Carbon \nFree Standard : \nGrowth in ALLETE’s market value rests heavily on Minnesota Power’s ability to \ncontinue providing reliable service to customers at affordable rates while \nsuccessfully implementing its plan to comply with Minnesota’s Carbon Free \nStandard. Achieving that comp liance requirement is expected to generate an overall \nreturn for the benefit of the Partners. In addition, prudent investments in the non -\nregulated subsidiaries of ALLETE can also increase overall value. . . . [T]his benefit \nto Partners will not come at th e expense of diminished service to customers. Rather, \nsuch an increase in ALLETE’s market value would also be indicative of continued \nprovision of reliable service to customers and compliance with regulatory \nrequirements.309 \n \nIn short, the Partners are going to earn their total return by helping ALLETE, and particularly \nMinnesota Power, become a more valuable company.  \nAn essential component of ALLETE ’s increase in value will be the investments needed for \nsuccessful completion of its energy transition and compliance with the Carbon Free Standard. As \nthese investments are made, the value of ALLETE will increase. [HCTS INFORMATION \nBEGINS ...  \n \n308 Ex.

The record \ndemonstrates that public markets typically value utility companies at a market -to-book value \ngreater than one.311 That means that the public market value of a utility is greater than its book \nvalue (or rate base). This market reality is fully consistent with the assumptions included in the \nPartners’ valuation models, and the Partners’ theory for how they will earn a return on their \ninvestment in ALLETE. While some Opposing Parties have concerns about how to interpret public \nmarket valuation of utility companies, the facts are undisputed on the record.312 For example, it \nwas established during the evidentiary hearing that the stock market values utilities higher than \ntheir book value, and that relationship also holds true when utilities are sold or purchased.313 These \n \n310 Ex.

As explained \nabove, part of the Partners’ investment theory is that Minnesota Power, and therefore ALLETE, \nwill be worth more once it has complied with the Carbon Free Standard. As explained by Witness \nBram,314 as ALLETE is further de -risked, such as by decreasing its reliance on coal and increasing \nits investments in transmissio n, the market interest in ALLETE can improve further, helping drive \nthe Partners’ return on investment at the point they exit their investment in the future. The potential \ninvestment returns produced by the valuation models are based in part on this assumption, and it \nis a further example of how the interests of the Partners are aligned with the public interest in \ncomplying with the Carbon Free Standard.  \nFurther, there is no impact to the public interest from the possibility of a future sale. As \nexplained by Witness Alley, an investment can increase in value while it remains on the books —\njust like an individual who purchases a stock and sees its value incr ease over time.315 The increased \nvalue of that investment exists regardless of whether it is sold, but it could  be sold at some point \nin order to realize the investment. The possibility of a sale at some point in the future does not \ncreate any risk to the public interest.316 \n \n314 Ex.

Further, to \nthe extent that there is any risk, it is risk held by the Partners if they do not receive the total returns \n(resting primarily on the price received in sale of the Partners’ interests) that were included in the \nIC Memos . As explained by Witness Bram, “The Partners will bear the costs and risks of \nimplementing a subst antial transformation of Minnesota Power and other ALLETE businesses \n(which should substantially increase the market value of ALLETE) . . . .”317 In short, the Partners \nhave made reasonable, market -based assumptions about the return on their investment in ALLETE \nand are choosing to bear the risk if those assumptions turn out to be incorrect.  \nE. The Plan for Governance  of ALLETE is Reasonable and Consistent with the \nPublic Interest . \nThe basic day-to-day governance structure with respect to Minnesota Power will remain \nthe same in all material respects following  the Acquisition. Following closing of the Acquisition, \nALLETE will continue to exist as the surviving corporation under Minnesota law and the ALLETE \nBoard of Directors will be the only board that governs the Company. While the Partners will, \ntogether, hav e a right to appoint a majority of the ALLETE Board, neither Partner will individually \nhave the ability to control the Board, a nd the relationship between Minnesota Power and the \nALLETE Board will remain the same. Most importantly, following the Acquisition, Minnesota \nPower will remain subject to Commission jurisdiction and regulation, and the Commission will \ncontinue to ensure th at Minnesota Power’s rates, terms and conditions of service are just and \nreasonable.  \n \n317 Ex.

Company Management will Continue to Oversee Day-to-Day Operations . \nFirst and foremost, the goals of the Company align with the interests of the Partners. As \nWitness Alley testified on behalf of CPP Investments, Minnesota Power’s investments “include a \ndecarbonization plan that will be executed over the long -term, which aligns with CPP Investments’ \nlong-term investme nt goals.”318 Similarly, Witness Bram testified that “GIP’s interests and the \ninterests of its investors are fully aligned with the interests and needs of Minnesota Power and \nALLETE more broadly.”319 In short, the Partners are aligned with, and support, ALLETE’s and \nMinnesota Power’s strategic vision, which is a primary reason the Partners are interested in the \nAcquisition.320 The Partners are not incentiv ized to take actions that are not in the interests of \nALLETE.321 \nEqually important to the Partners is ALLETE’s strong management team, which is \ncomprised of “experienced energy executives with long tenures managing utility operations, [and] \nexecuting and optimizing large -scale energy infrastructure projects with excepti onal levels of \nreliability.”322 Consequently, the Partners have committed to maintaining the ALLETE senior \nmanagement team  post-Acquisition , and furthermore such management will continue to oversee \nday-to-day operations of the Company.  Today, ALLETE executive officers “are responsible for \nthe Company’s day -to-day business operations ,” and that will remain the same after the \n \n318 Ex.

Opposing Parties’ concerns are unfounded and a majority \nindependent board is neither necessary nor appropriate.  \nAs a threshold matter, Opposing Parties assume without any evidence that there will be \nsituations where the interests of the Partners diverge from the interests of ALLETE. No Opposing \nParty has identified any situation where that is likely to be the case. To the contrary, the Partners \nhave explained that they have significant incentives to act in the interest of ALLETE to protect \ntheir multi -billion -dollar investment in the Company. Said another way, the Partners have no \nreason to act in a way that harms AL LETE, and every incentive not to do so. In this way, the \nincentives of future board members will be similar to those of existing board members. During the \nevidentiary hearing, Department Witness Vavro admitted that the purpose of ALLETE’s current \nboard is to represent current investors, just like the purpose of the future board will be to represent \ninvestors at that time.333  \nMore specifically, it is typical in private investments like the Acquisition for the parties \nthat bear the economic risk of the business’s operations to determine board membership and decide \n \n330 Ex.

While the Partners collectively have the right  to appoint the \nmajority of the ALLETE Board, neither controls the Board. This is because all matters subject to \nvote by the ALLETE Board require a majority vote to pass, neither Partner has a majority , and \n \n334 Ex.

As noted by Witness Bram, who has experience serving on company boards, \nindependent directors “provide additional oversight, input, and further reduce any risks associated \nwith any one Partner, board member, or portion of Board m embers” even when they are not a \nmajority.341 In this situation, the independent members will provide that value and will serve to \nbalance the interests of the Partners.  \nFinally, ALLETE is a Minnesota corporation and each of the Board members will have a \nfiduciary duty under Minnesota law. This means that each Board member is required by law to act \naccordingly, “in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the bes t interests of the \ncorporation .”342 The Opposing Parties completely ignore these fiduciary duty requirements and \nwhat the laws of Minnesota require. In fact, Department Witness Vavro admitted that she is not \nfamiliar with Minnesota law or these requirements —a striking admission for a witness addressing \nissues of corporate governance  of a Minnesota corporation .343 In order to do the things about which \nOpposing Parties are concerned, the individual members of the ALLETE Board would have to \nviolate their fiduciary duties.  \n \n340 Ex.

Many utilities that are acquired by private investors do not have independent boards and \nmany utility acquisitions do not result in the acquiror having to  give up control of the company \nthey are acquiring.  Precedent take -private transactions involving Cleco Corporation, Puget Sound \nEnergy, and Duquesne Light Company , for example,  did not require a majority independent board \nbut have relatively minimal, if any, requirement for independent board members.345 The \nAcquisition, with its three independent board members, including the CEO of ALLETE, is \nconsistent with many other take -private transactions. The Opposing Parties have not identified any \nspecific reason why this Acquisition requires a fully independent  board when many others have \nnot. \nSecond, Department Witness Vavro acknowledged that in both the El Paso Electric and \nSouth Jersey Industries cases , IIF proposed in its petition to have a majority independent board346 \nbecause IIF’s internal practice is to utilize separate governance structures and that is “its \n \n344 Ex.

TXU Corporation, discussed above in Section  II.C.1 above, was acquired by private \ninvestors in 2007. The Public Utility Commission of Texas (“PUCT”) required that the utility in \nthat proceeding, Oncor Electric Delivery Company,  LLC (“Oncor”), have its own board with a \nmajority of disinterested directors, but that was based on a specific and extreme set of facts not \npresent here.  \nAs Witness  Baker describes it, the TXU (Oncor) acquisition was among “the largest \nleveraged buyouts in history,” premised on a “bet” that the acquiror could profit from affiliated \nmerchant generation.348 The utility, Oncor, was a very small piece of an over $40 billion \nacquisition that was very risky because the highly leveraged transaction was primarily focused on \nderegulated merchant generation located in a deregulated state. In contrast, the Partners a re using \na very low amount of debt to acquire ALLETE, Minnesota Power represents the vast majority of \nthe revenue for ALLETE, the Company  is located in a state that has not been deregulated, and the \nCompany is  regulated by a strong utility commission.  \nThus, while Texas regulators have required an independent board, it is also clear that it is \nbased on the specific fact scenarios in that state and in specific transactions, and not a categorical \nrequirement. Indeed, provisions related to governance and other commitments must be evaluated \non the specific facts of each case, and not some categorical requirement like the assumption that \n \n347 Tr. Evid.

The Acquisition is materially different in \nthat it involves two unaffiliated buyers,  neither of whom have complete control and each of whom \nhas consent rights,  creating the inherent checks and balances discussed above. These checks and \nbalances mitigate the risk that an owner  could negatively affect the success and health of the utility \nsince such decisions would also be adverse to the other Partner’s interests.351   \nEach  utility acquisition  transaction is unique and conditions and commitments in one \ntransaction are not necessarily appropriate for another.  While Opposing Parties have raised \nspeculative concerns about the governance plans, there is no record evidence to support the \nposition that it is necessary to take control of the Company away from its owners to protect the \npublic interest.  Such a drastic measure is not warranted in light of the many other safeguards and \nregulatory protections. While there is an examp le of regulators  requiring  a fully independent board, \nthat was  in response to  an extreme fact scenario , and other acquirors have agreed to majority \nindependent boards because of their philosophy . Neither of those factors  are present here. As a \n \n349 Ex. CPPIB -GIP-207, Bram  HCTS  Response Testimony at 6:7 –7:25, eDocket No. 20254 -217896 -03. \n350 See id.  \n351 Ex.

Eliminating the customary control of shareholders over the Board when not \nnecessary to address any substantiated governance concer ns would have a material chilling effect \non investments in utilities, which is particularly problematic at a time when utilities need greater \namounts of capital to implement the energy transition and meet statutory requirements like the \nCarbon Free Standar d.352  \n3. The Commission Retains the Authority to Protect Customer Interests . \nThe Opposing Parties also ignore the greatest protection afforded to customers against the \nspeculative possibility of abuse by a utility board: the regulator. Balancing the public interests, \nincluding the interests of customers and utility investors, is th e key reason that the Commission \nexists. The Commission is routinely engaged in this task on a day -to-day basis. The concerns raised \nby the Opposing Parties are not likely to happen because the Commission will not allow them to \nhappen, and concerns otherwi se appear to be premised on a worry that the Commission will, for \nsome reason, stop protecting the public interest after the Acquisition. That is certainly not the case . \nNothing about the Acquisition will affect the Commission’s authority or limit its ability to balance \nthese interests as it has always done. The Partners fully understand, accept and respect that the \nCommission will continue to use its regulatory authority  to balance the interests of investors and \ncustomers.353 \n \n352 Ex.

The Affiliated Interest Statute and Commitments by the Petitioners will \nEnsure there is no Self -Dealing . \nThe Commission’s existing affiliated interest regulations and the additional commitments \noffered by the Petitioners will ensure that customers are protected from the risks of self -dealing \nbetween Minnesota Power and the other investments of the Partners.  \n1. The Commission ’s Affiliated Interest Requirements  are Intended to Protect \nagainst the Risk of Self-Dealing.  \nThe Commission has been effectively regulating the risks of affiliated interests for many \nyears based on consistent interpretations of existing  legal requirements. In general, Minn. Stat.  \n§ 216B.48 (“the Affiliated Interest Statute”) requires that utilities identify “affiliated interests” in \nan annual report each year, disclose any contracts or agreements over $50,000 with those affiliated \ninterests to the Commission, and receive Commission  approval.354 \nThe Commission has the exclusive authority to set public utility rates,355 including the \nauthority to evaluate the cost of every contract before it is included in rates. That analysis typically \ntakes place at the time a public utility requests recovery of costs,356 and the Commission can \nexclude some or all of a utility’s contract c osts from rates if it identifies problems. In contrast, t he \nprimary purpose of the Affiliated Interest Statute is to  identify a subset of contracts where there \ncould be heightened concerns regarding self -dealing, and  give the Commission an opportunity to  \nassert jurisdiction over the agreement earlier in the process.357 \n \n354 See Minn. Stat. § 216B.48.  \n355 Minn. Stat. § 216B.16.  \n356 This analysis could take place in a general rate case pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 216B.16, or in a rider proceeding.  \n357 See DOC -301, Vavro Direct at 11 :20–22, eDocket No. 20252 -214941 -03 (“[Affiliated interest] standards are meant \nto ensure sufficient transparency around contracts between affiliated entities to prevent potential conflicts of \ninterest.”) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 98 \n 2. Petitioners Have Commit ted to Follow the Affiliated Interest Statute and \nProvide Additional Reporting and Transparency . \nThe Partners will follow the Commission’s requirements related to affiliated interests, and \nhave made this commitment clear through formal testimony. Witness Alley testified on behalf of \nCPP Investments:  \nTo be clear, CPP Investments takes seriously Minnesota’s \nrequirements regarding affiliate interest concerns, and we are \ncommitted to ensuring that no self -dealing [sic] results from the \nPartners’ relationship to ALLETE. As explained in the Petition and \nin Direct Testimony, Minnesota Power will continue to apply the \naffiliated interests requirements in the same manner as they have \nbeen applied for many years, and the same way that they are applied \nby other utilities in the state.358 \n \nWitness Bram provided similar testimony on behalf of GIP:  \nGIP is committed to following the Commission’s requirements \nrelated to affiliated interests, as protecting the integrity of its \ninvestments is a core part of GIP’s business model.359 \n \nThe Partners have provided statements that they will follow the well -understood requirements that \nthe Commission has been applying for years.  \nFurther, the Partners have explained that they have no incentive to engage in self -dealing. \nIn fact, the Partners have strong incentives not to engage in self -dealing. As Witness Alley \nexplained, “[A]llegations of self -dealing would do far more harm to the  business reputation of CPP \nInvestments, both in Minnesota and elsewhere it does business, than any benefit that could be \nobtained.”  The Partners have fiduciary duties to the funds that they manage, including the funds \nthat will invest in ALLETE. As such, they cannot engage in self -dealing that benefits one fund \nover another without risk of violating their fiduciary duties, which carries significant \nconsequences. Concerns about self -dealing fail to recognize these profound legal and reputational \n \n358 Ex. MP -31, Alley Rebuttal at 40:25 –41:3, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -09. \n359 Ex.

Moreover, b ecause of the transparency and additional \nreporting the Partners have committed to, it is unlikely that any self -dealing could be concealed. \nAny hint of self -dealing  would negatively impact regulatory outcomes in Minnesota, and future \ninvestments opportunities in Minnesota and elsewhere.  \nThe Partners have also provided clear statements about how they will follow the Affiliated \nInterest Statute in the same way it is being applied now. As explained above, and in more detail \nby Witness Anderson,360 after the Acquisition is approved, Minnesota Power will continue to file \nannual affiliated interest reports. The annual affiliated interest reports will identify all entities that \nare affiliated interests with Minnesota Power under Commission regulation, and going forward \nthat list will include the Partners and the business entities between the ALLETE and the Partners.361 \nAny contracts between the entities identified as affiliated in the annual report and Minnesota Power \nwill be submitted to the Commission for approval as affiliated interest agreements.  \nConsistent with the Commission’s regulation regarding affiliated interests, the annual \naffiliated interest report will not identify the Partners’ other investments as affiliated of Minnesota \nPower. As described below , this treatment is fully consistent with the Commission’s regulation of \nMinnesota Power and the other utilities in the state.  \nTo mitigate any concerns of self -dealing outside the affiliated interest requirements, the \nPetitioners have  also agreed to additional reporting and transparency above and beyond what is \nrequired by current regulations.  As explained by Witness Anderson,362 each year Minnesota Power \nwill contact every supplier (or customer with contracted rates ) with which it does business and \nrequest that they identify whether they are owned more than 5 percent by GIP, BlackRock, or CPP \n \n360 Ex. MP -15, Anderson Direct at 10 –12, eDocket No. 202412 -212968 -06. \n361 The list of these entities is included in Table 1 on page 15 of Witness Anderson’s Direct Testimony. Id. at 15.  \n362 Ex. MP -35, Anderson Rebuttal  at 18:6 –4, eDocket No.  20253 -216055 -06. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 100 \n Investments. While these suppliers are not “affiliated interests” under the Commission’s \nregulation, every supplier that identifies this ownership will be listed separately in the annual \naffiliated interest reports to ensure transparency. Further, any time  that Minnesota Power enters \ninto a contract in excess of $1 million with any supplier listed on the annual affiliated interest \nreport, it will provide a compliance filing to the Commission. The compliance filing will include \ndisclosures about the nature a nd cost of the contract. Critically, the compliance filing will also \ninclude a signed certification from the Company and the supplier that the contract was entered into \nat arms -length . The reporting is designed to be comprehensive. As explained by Witness \nAnderson, the $1 million threshold would have captured 75 percent of purchase order spending, \nand 94 percent of non -purchase order spending, during 2024. This proposal was intentionally \ncrafted to respond to concerns raised about the potential for self -dealing and the impact it could \nhave on customers.  \nThis reporting is in excess of what is required by law and what the Commission receives \nfrom other utilities. For each contract disclosed, the Commission, the Department, the OAG, and \nany other interested party will be able to evaluate potential issues, as k the Company for \ninformation, and investigate if any concerns arise. If problems are identified, the Commission will \nhave full authority to ensure that any related costs are not included in rates and take other necessary \nactions.  \n3. The Department ’s New Interpretation of the Affiliated Interest Statute is \nWrong . \nThere is no dispute that the Affiliated Interest Statute will apply to the Partners after the \nacquisition is closed. The Department  suggest s, however, that all the Partners’ other investments \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 101 \n must also be categorized as an affiliated interest.363 The Departmen t’s interpretation  is incorrect, \nand it  is clear it is incorrect  because the Commission has never applied the statute in that way and \nbecause doing so would lead to an absurd result that the Legislature never intended.  \na) The Commission Does Not Apply the Affiliated Interest Standard in \nthe Way Proposed by the Department . \nThe Department argues, in particular, that the Affiliated Interest Statute must apply to every \nbusiness in which the Partners invest.364 That would be a significant change from how the \nCommission has been applying the Affiliated Interest Statute for years.  \nThe largest investors in ALLETE are currently BlackRock, Inc. (13.45 percent), The \nVanguard Group (11.01 percent), and State Street Corp. (5.03 percent).365 This has been roughly \nthe same for many years —Minnesota Power has listed BlackRock and Vanguard as affiliate d \ninterests  in every affiliated interest annual report since at least 2015.366 Vanguard, like BlackRock, \nmanages investments in thousands of companies across the world. Since at least 2015, Minnesota \nPower has filed annual affiliated interest reports that do not list the other investments of BlackRock \nor Vanguard, taking the position that they are not required by affiliated interest regulations.  Neither \nthe Commission, the Department, or any other stakeholder has raised concerns about these filings \nor the interpretation of affiliated interest requirements.  \nMinnesota Power’s application of affiliated interest requirements is the same as all the \nother utilities in Minnesota . All investor -owned utilities in the state make annual affiliated interest \n \n363 See Ex. DOC -301, Vavro Direct at 13 –14, eDocket No. 20252 -214941 -03. \n364 Ex.

As of 20 25, Xcel Energy,367 Otter Tail Power Company,368 CenterPoint Energy,369 \nMinnesota Energy Resources Corp.,370 and Great Plains Natural Gas371 are also owned more than \n5% by BlackRock and Vanguard.372 None of these utilities identify the other investments of \nBlackRock and Vanguard as affiliated interests.  As with Minnesota Power, neither the \nCommission, the Department, or any other stakeholder has raised concerns with this consistent \ninterpretation.  The Commission’s continuous acceptance of these filings, year after year, is an \nindication that Minnesota Power’s interpretation of affiliated interest requirements is correct.  \nThe Department’s new interpretation would reverse years of consistent application  and has \nno record support . The Department’s position was supported by Witness Vavro, who admitted \nduring the evidentiary hearing that she had not read the annual affiliated interest reports  and is not \nfamiliar with the Commission’s practices .373 Witness Vavro also admitted that she was not an \nattorney,374 and as such cannot provide analysis about the specific language of the  Affiliated \nInterest Statute, or the Commission’s historical interpretation of that law.  \n \n367 Xcel Energy Annual Affiliated Interest Report, Docket No. E,G-999/PR -25-17 (Apr. 1, 2025), eDocket No.  20254 -\n217084 -01 (Vanguard (13.05%), BlackRock, Inc.

Hearing, Vol . 2 at 463:2 –3 (Vavro Cross).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 103 \n b) The Department ’s New Interpretation of Affiliated Interest \nRequirements would lead to an Absurd Result and Create \nSignificant Regulatory Problems . \nThe legislature does not intent to create results that are “absurd, impossible of execution, \nor unreasonable.”375 Laws can be interpreted “in a sensible manner” to avoid such results.376  \nThe Department’s new interpretation of affiliated interest requirements would be absurd. \nAccording to the Department, because GIP (and therefore BlackRock) and CPP Investments are \naffiliated interests, every entity they invest in also becomes an affiliated  interest.  As noted by the \nCommission’s Staff,  \nGiven the nature of . . . BlackRock, it is likely that virtually every \ncontract . . . with a publicly traded corporation – and with some \nprivately held businesses – would become ‘affiliated interest’ \ncontracts under the interpretation used by the Departmen t. This \ncould potentially result in an increase in the number of contracts \nrequiring Commission approval beyond Staff’s – and the \nDepartment’s – current capacity to process in a timely manner.377 \n \nIn short, the Department’s interpretation would be absurd and impossible to apply because it would \nrequire nearly every contract ALLETE executes to be specifically approved by the Commission.  \n The Department’s interpretation is also absurd because it would apply impossible new \nregulatory requirements to all utilities in the state, not just Minnesota Power.  As noted above, Xcel \nEnergy, Otter Tail Power, CenterPoint, MERC, and Greater Minnesota Gas are all owned more \nthan 5 percent by BlackRock and Vanguard. The Department’s interpretation of the Affiliated \nInterest Statute would mean that all of those utilit ies are also affiliated interests with the entire \n \n375 Minn. Stat. § 645.17.  \n376 Minn.

It would be impossible for the Commission to administer \nsuch a requirement , and would provide little benefit to customers.378 \n Further, the Department’s interpretation results in absurdity regardless of whether the \nAcquisition is actually approved. BlackRock already owns more than 5 percent of ALLETE’s \nshares, as does Vanguard. Under the Department’s theory, ALLETE should already be an aff iliated \ninterest with every company that BlackRock and Vanguard invest in. As the Staff noted, “If the \nDepartment’s interpretation of the statute is legally correct, then BlackRock, as well as Vanguard, \nalready owns a large enough share of ALLETE  (as well as Xcel, Otter tail, MERC, and other \nMinnesota utilities), to trigger the statute.”379 That is obviously not the case, or the Commission \nwould have taken regulatory action to correct the issue in the annual affiliated interest dockets that \nall utilities file every year.  \n The most reasonable interpretation of affiliated interest requirements is the one that has \nbeen applied for many years: when an investment manager owns a utility, the investment manager \nitself is an affiliated interest, but its subsequent investments are not. \nc) The Department ’s Concerns are Unfounded, and Any Risks Related \nto Self -Dealing are Resolved by Commitments . \nWhile the Department’s interpretation of affiliated interest requirements is incorrect as \ndescribed above, the Partners have gone to great lengths to provide additional assurances to address \nthe Department’s underlying concern. To that end, t he Partners have offered protections to ensure \nthat self -dealing will not happen . As described above, Witness Bram and Witness Alley each \n \n378 The cost of such regulatory burden would likely be passed on to customers through rates. See Minn. Stat. § 216B. 62 \n(authorizing the Department and the Commission to assess  their costs to utilities, which are then included in rates ). \n379 MPUC Staff Briefing Papers at 21 (Sept. 11, 2024), eDocket No. 20249 -210143 -01. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 105 \n provided testimony that they will not engage in self -dealing with ALLETE.380 The Partners have \nalso committed to additional protections to ensure that self -dealing does not occur, above and \nbeyond what is required by law or that the Commission receives from any other utility.  \nIn response to this testimony  and evidence , no Opposing  Party has identified any specific \ninstance in which either of the Partners engaged in self -dealing  with respect to any of their high -\nprofile investments over many years , or provided any rational explanation for why the Partners \nwould do so  with respect to ALLETE  given the significant risks to their business relationships and \ntheir fiduciary obligations to their own investors.  \nThe speculative nature of the Parties’ analysis on this issue is further demonstrated by the \nfact that no Party substantively responded to the additional commitments the Petitioners provided \nin Rebuttal. The Department ’s response did not include analysis. The Department did not provide \nan explanation  of why the additional commitment for supplier reporting and verification  was \ninsufficient to protect against self -dealing, provide any suggestions on how the commitments \nshould be adjusted, or identify any spec ific concerns. The Department’s responses  consisted of \none paragraph summarizing the new commitments, and one sentence noting that they “may help \nwith transparency and are a step in the right direction,” but that they were still not enough.381 No \nother Opposing P arty responded to the new self -dealing protections, or provided any analysis about \nthem.  \n \n380 Ex. MP -31, Alley Rebuttal at 41:17 –20 eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -09 (“CPP Investments has no intention or any \nreal incentive to engage in self -dealing . . . .”), ; Ex.

The Affiliated Interest Process and Additional Commitments from the \nPartners Resolve any Concerns Related to BlackRock ’s Ownership of GIP.  \nSome Opposing Parties raise concerns about BlackRock’s ownership  of GIP  and how it \nwill affect affiliated interests.384 These concerns are overstated because, as discussed above, \nBlackRock currently owns more than 10 percent of ALLETE’s stock, and there have been no \nindications of any concerns related to self -dealing.  \nTo the extent there are any concerns related to BlackRock , those concerns are fully resolved \nby the Commission’s existing Affiliated Interest procedures and the additional commitments \nprovided by the Petitioners. Going forward, i f the Company seeks to contract with BlackRock, it \nwill file an affiliated interest application with the Commission —just as it is required to do no w. \nFurther, every supplier with which the Company does business that is owned more than 5 percent \nby BlackRock will trigger a compliance  filing , which will include a description of the agreement \nand a certification that it was reached at arms -length.  This commitment ensures that self -dealing \nwill not occur and should fully resolve any concerns regarding BlackRock’s other investments.  \n Overall, t he Petitioners have comprehensively responded to concerns about the potential \nfor self -dealing. Even if there were legitimate concerns —which there are not —the Petition ers have \nproposed significant commitments that will ensure self -dealing  does not take place. No Party has \n \n382 See Minn. Stat. § 302A.255 (establishing limitations on conflicts of interest for directors of a Minnesota \ncorporation, such as ALLETE).  \n383 Tr. Evid.

CURE -602, Baker Direct at 27, eDocket No. 20252 -214963 -04. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 107 \n identified any additional commitments or changes that should be made. In contrast, the Petitioners \nhave confirmed that they will continue to apply the Affiliated Interest Statute in the same way that \nthe Commission has applied it for years, and provided ma terial commitments above and beyond \nwhat is required by law to address any potential for self -dealing. As a result, the Acquisition does \nnot pose any material risks related to affiliated interests or self -dealing.  \nG. The Commission has the Authority to Enforce the Commitments of the \nAcquisition, and Continuing Enforcement Authority over Minnesota Power.  \nOpposing Parties suggest that the commitments the Petitioners have offered carry less \nweight because they are not enforceable. They are wrong —any commitments incorporated into a \nCommission order are clearly enforceable under the law, and the Commission has  ongoing \nauthority over Minnesota Power going forward, as previously discussed.  \nTo be clear, the Partners and the Company intend that the commitments offered in this \nproceeding are binding and enforceable. To the extent there is any doubt —which there should not \nbe, as described below —the Partners further commit that any failure to ach ieve any commitment \nin this Settlement or to comply with any other condition the Commission places on approval of the \nAcquisition, will be a violation of the Commission’s order under Minnesota law, and enforceable \nagainst the entity for whom the action (or  non-action) is required.  \nThe Partners have not previously made this commitment because it is a restatement of \nexisting law, and it should be clear that any commitments included in a Commission order would \nbe enforceable.  Minn. Stat. § 216B.54  provides :  \nWhenever the commission or department shall be of the opinion that any person or \npublic utility is failing or omitting or is about to fail or omit to do anything required \nof it … by any order of the commission , or is doing anything or about to do \nanything, or permitting anything or about to permit anything to be done, contrary \nto or in violation of … any order of the commission , it shall refer the matter to the \nattorney general who shall take appropriate legal action.  \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 108 \n “Person” is defined in Minn. Stat. § 216B.02, subd. 3 and includes partnerships and corporations, \nincluding the Partners and Alloy Parent. Minn. Stat. § 216B.57 also provides that any person, as \ndefined, who knowingly and intentionally violates or fails to  obey a Commission order is subject \nto financial penalties. There can be no serious doubt that these provisions apply to the \ncommitments offered by the Petitioners, which will be included in a Commission order.  \n Some of the commitments offered by the Commission are, theoretically, outside the \nstandard authority of the Commission. For example, the Commission cannot order the shareholders \nof a utility to make non -recoverable contributions to low -income programs. It is also not clear \nwhether the Commission has authority to prohibit or limit a public utility from paying dividends \nto its shareholders, or require shareholders to provide equity capital. But the Commission has a \nlong history of accepting commitments from utilities that are beyond its authority to impose against \nthe objections of a party —and when those commitments are incorporated into a Commission order \nand accepted by the party, they become binding and enforceable.385 The Commission has \nspecifically done so in merger dockets,386 and those commitments have been enforced at later \n \n385 See, e.g.,  In the Matter of an Inquiry into Actions by Electric and Natural Gas Utilities in Light of the COVID -19 \nPandemic Emergency , Docket No. E, G -999/CI -20-375, ORDER ESTABLISHING PEACETIME EMERGENCY \nREQUIREMENTS AND MODIFYING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (Aug. 13, 2020), eDocket No. 20208 -165843 -01 \n(accepting the offer of regulated utilities to suspend disconnections during the COVID pandemic); In the Matter of \nthe Petition of Northern States Power Company d/b/a Xcel Energy for Approval of 2021 True -Up Mechanisms , Docket \nNo. E -002/M -20-743, ORDER APPROVING TRUE-UPS WITH MODIFICATIONS AND REQUIRING XCEL TO WITHDRAW ITS \nNOTICE OF CHANGE IN RATES AND INTERIM RATE PETITION  (Apr. 2, 2021), eDocket No. 20214 -172538 -01 (accepting \nXcel Energy’s offer to withdraw its pending rate case if certain rate adjustment proposals are approved).  \n386 The Commission does not have the authority to order customer refunds.

The Commission closely regulates Minnesota \nPower’s rates, including the level of return on investments.388 It must specifically approve large \ninvestments, and makes dozens of other decisions each year that impact the utility. The Partners \nfully recognize that they must follow through on the commitments made in this proceeding, and \nthat failing to do so could i mpact the many other decisions the Commission makes related to \nMinnesota Power.  \nUltimately, there should be no reasonable doubt that the Commission has the authority to \nenforce the commitments offered in this proceeding, which will be incorporated into a Commission \norder.  \nH.

As dis cussed herein, Witness Vavro’s analysis was similarly limited. As a result, her \nopinion provides no basis to question Witness Lapson’s careful analysis and  resulting conclusions,   \nAs Witness Lapson explained in her Rebuttal Testimony , the perceived  risk that arises from \nthe non -Minnesota Power aspect of ALLETE  is not a new one , is not being caused by the \nAcquisition,  and is addressed by long -standing Commission oversight of ALLETE . The ring -\nfencing provisions are intended to preserve the status quo and eliminate any suggested adverse \neffects related to the Partners and the Partners’ affiliates; ALLETE’s status vis -a-vis the regulated \nentity is neither caused nor changed by the Acqu isition.403    \nWhen pressed about the specific aspects of the proposed ring -fencing measures that \nDepartment Witness Vavro found to be inadequate, she could only point to the lack of a legal non -\nconsolidation opinion “as an example.”404 When asked what other conditions Department Witness \nVavro would recommend to protect ALLETE, she could not point to anything.405 Even though the \nlack of a legal non -consolidation opinion is the only example Department Witness Vavro identified \nas an insufficiency, Department Witness Vavro’s criticism misses the mark.406  As Witness Lapson \nexplained, non -consolidation opinions are not sought in most merger transactions, and perhaps \n \n402 Ex.

The Formation of a Holding Company  is Not a Necessary Condition for the \nAcquisition to be Consistent with the Public Interest, and is an Issue that the \nCommission can Consider in the Future.  \nThe Department argues that as currently structured, Minnesota Power is not sufficiently \nseparated from the non -regulated businesses of ALLETE. The Department  is concerned that this \ncreates “exposure to financial risks,” and Witness Vavro goes so far as to say there “are no ring -\nfencing protections between Minnesota Power and ALLETE’s non -regulated businesses.”410 In \nshort, the Department appears to be arguing ( without recommending ) that in order to sufficiently \nprotect Minnesota Power from risks created by affiliates and their operations, ALLETE must \ncreate a holding company that makes Minnesota Power a stand -alone entity rather than a division \nof ALLETE.   \nThis is not an issue that is created by the Acquisition, but as Witness Vavro notes, “has \nbeen a topic of discussion between Minnesota Power and the Commission for at least fifteen \nyears.”411 At the request of the Commission, the Company submitted an analysis of a holding \ncompany structure for Minnesota Power, including the potential benefits and issues with \n \n407 Ex.

To \ndate the Commission has not found the Company’s processes or structure to be inadequate , has \nnot found any  corporate separateness risks that need to be addressed , and has not  required the \nCompany to convert to a holding company  structure .414   \nNothing about the Acquisition changes ALLETE’s internal  corporate organization, \nincluding Minnesota Power, the analysis related to the risks of Minnesota Power’s current \norganizational form , or the existing protections that are in place.415 If anything, the additional \ncorporate separateness measures and transparency commitments described in Sections  II.H above \nand II. J below, will provide greater protection for Minnesota Power and afford the Commission \ngreater insight into Minnesota Power’s operations to ensure they are appropriately separated from \nthose of its affiliates.  \n \n412 In the  Matter of the Application for Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -09-1151, McMillan  Direct, Schedule DJM -1 (Nov. 2, 2009), eDocket No. 200911 -\n43466 -02.

The Partners Have Committed to Transparency in this Proceeding and After \nthe Acquisition is Approved . \nCertain Parties expressed concern that the Partners are not willing to replicate the level of \ntransparency that ALLETE currently provides to the Commission.416 But as both Partner Witnesses \nAlley and Bram testified, the Partners have made key commitments to ensure transparency post -\nacquisition that address these concerns. In particular, the Partners have committed to provide \naccess to books and records of the en tities up to and including Alloy Parent (i.e., well beyond the \npublic utility entity)  that are related to Minnesota Power’s operations that are under the \nCommission’s jurisdiction.417 In addition, Minnesota Power will file audited ALLETE \nconsolidated financial statements and schedules as part of the annual capital structure petition, as \nwell as provide the Commission with audited financial statements of ALLETE and Alloy Parent.418 \nWhile these are styled as “affirmations” because they will continue Minnesota Power’s practice of \ntransparency, they ensure transparency to the Commission and interested parties.  \nFurthermore, while some Parties have raised concerns about discovery issues, the Partners \nand the Company have responded to hundreds of information requests without issue. While there \nwere some disagreements about a limited number of Highly Confidential Trade Secret do cuments, \nseveral of those disagreements were ultimately resolved. Further, concerns about Highly \nConfidential Trade Secret documents were well -founded given some of the issues that occurred in \nrelation to some participants in this proceeding.419 The other Parties in this matter that have \nexpressed a concern about transparency have not identified any specific, relevant information that \nthey want and that will not be provided.

The Acquisition Will Not Result in Rate Increases . \nSeveral Opposing Parties raise concerns  that the Acquisition will result in increased rates \nfor customers. They are wrong. In fact, substantial evidence in the record demonstrates \nconclusively that the Acquisition will not result in increased rates and may actually  decrease rates \ncompared to the status quo. Further, while some Opposing Parties raise concerns regarding future \nrate impacts, the record demonstrates  that those concerns are speculative, exaggerated, and \nunrelated to the Acquisition.  \n1. The Acquisition Will Not Increase Rates because t he Petitioners have \nCommitted to Not Seek Recovery in Rates of Specific Costs. \nThe record demonstrates that the Acquisition will not result in increased costs. The \nPetitioners have committed that they will not seek recovery of several non -recurring costs related \nto the Acquisition, including: (1) the acquisition premium paid to obtain ownership of ALLETE; \n(2) transaction costs relating to the Acquisition; and (3 ) transition costs.420  Opposing Parties have \nnot identified any specific cost caused by the Acquisition that the Petitioners have not already \nagreed will be non -recoverable.  \n2. The Acquisition May Reduce Rates Compared to the Status Quo. \nThe Petitioners have also committed that, in the future, Minnesota Power will no longer \nseek recovery of certain costs that it currently recovers in rates. Specifically, the Petitioners have \ncommitted that that as long as the Partners are owners of ALLETE, they will not seek recovery of: \n(1) compensation or expenses for Board members that are not independent ;421 (2) investor relations \n \n420 Ex. MP -27, Cady Rebuttal, Schedule 1, Commitments 17 and 18, eDocket No. 20253 -216055 -03. \n421 Id. at Commitment 26.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 117 \n costs;422 and (3) flotation costs relating to equity issuances.423 Absent the Acquisition, each of \nthese costs would likely be included in rates in the future . Minnesota Power’s most recent rate case \nwas resolved by a settlement that included costs related to Board compensation and Investor \nRelations. The rate case s ettlement explicitly includes $0.66 million in costs related to Board \ncompensation and expenses.424 The rate case settlement  also includes the initial proposed amount \nof Investor Relations costs, for a total of $0.17 million.425 While the rate case settlement  was silent \nas it relates to flotation costs, the Commission has approved their inclusion in the past .426  \nAfter the Acquisition is approved, these costs will no longer be requested in rate case \nproceedings, meaning that customers will pay less in rates each year that Minnesota Power is \nowned by the Partners than they would otherwise have paid without these com mitments. These \ncost savings are a benefit of the Acquisition, even though the Commission has recognized that cost \nsavings are not necessary for an acquisition to be in the public interest. In the recent acquisition of \nthe parent company of Minnesota Energ y Resources Corporation by Wisconsin Energy \nCorporation, the Commission specifically held that cost savings are not necessary for a transaction \nto be in the public interest:  \nThe Commission declines to require that MERC either prove that the merger has \nresulted in cost savings or have savings imputed to its revenues.  \n \nMERC has argued persuasively that the goal of the merger is not to achieve \nimmediate synergies but rather to better position the merged companies to access \ncapital and invest in infrastructure and customer -service improvements. Moreover, \n \n422 Id. at Commitment 24.  \n423 Id. at Commitment 23.  \n424 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Utility Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -23-155, Executed  Settlement Agreement at 7 (May 3, 2024), eDocket No. 20245 -\n206372 -01. \n425 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Utility Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -23-155, Volume 4 Workpapers, ADJ -IS-8 (Nov. 1, 2023), eDocket No. 202311 -\n200092 -08 (showing an investor relations cost of $174,678 included in the proposed rates).  \n426 In the Matter of the Application of Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E -015/GR -21-335, FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS , AND ORDER  at 46, eDocket No. 20232 -\n193486 -01 (explicitly including flotation costs when setting the ROE).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 118 \n any operational or capital -cost savings realized should benefit ratepayers through \nreduced rates. Under these circumstances, the public interest does not require that \nMERC demonstrate any particular level of savings as a result of the merger.  \n \nThe Commission also notes that the Xcel –New Century merger, on which the \nCommission imposed a cost -savings condition, was predicated in large part on \nobtaining savings by consolidating programs and reducing staff. In contrast, in this \ncase the merging comp anies have not identified a need for workforce reductions, \nand MERC has committed not to make any workforce reductions for at least two \nyears.427 \n \nIt is clear, based on Commission precedent, that cost savings are not required. The fact that the \nPetitioners have provided commitments that will result in cost savings even though this \nAcquisition is not premised on synergies  is a sign that the Acquisition is consistent with the public \ninterest.  \n3. The Acquisition Will Not Cause Long-Term Rate Impacts .   \nSome Opposing Parties suggest that the Partners or the Acquisition will cause Minnesota \nPower’s rates to increase in the future. They are wrong for several reasons.  \nFirst, the record contains substantial evidence demonstrating that Minnesota Power’s rate \nof return will not change because of the Acquisition. There is no dispute that the Commission will \ncontinue to have authority to set the return on equity for Minnesota Power . Further, as discussed \nabove, it is not likely that the Acquisition will have any impact on Minnesota Power’s cost of debt \nand—even if that were to occur —the Petitioners have committed that customers will be held \nharmless from any impacts to the co st of debt caused by the Acquisition. As a result, the \nAcquisition will have no impact on the cost of capital used to set Minnesota Power’s rates.  \nSecond, the Partners cannot increase Minnesota Power’s rates. Only the Commission can \nset rates. Further, when the Commission sets rates, the rates are required by law to be based on the \n \n427 In the Matter of a Request  for Approval of the Merger Agreement between Integrys Energy Group, Inc. and \nWisconsin Energy Corporation , Order Approving Merger Subject to Conditions at 8 –9 (June 24, 2015), eDocket No. \n20156 -111752 -01. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 119 \n cost of service.428 In other words, Minnesota Power’s rates will always be approved by the \nCommission, and they will include only those costs that are necessary to provide safe, reliable, \nand affordable utility service.  As a result, it is not possible for rates to increase unless the \nCommission determines that it is reasonable and necessary to do so.  \n Third , while the record includes some forecasts suggesting potential rate increases in the \nfuture, they are entirely speculative and, even if they do occur, would not be caused by the \nAcquisition. They are, instead, caused by the need for Minnesota Power to make material \ninvestments in its system to provide safe, reliable, and affordable power, and to comply with the \nCarbon Free Standard.  \nOpposing Parties seem to suggest that the record includes specific plans by the Partners to \nincrease rates in the future.429 That is not the case. The Partners do not have a “rate increase plan,” \nbecause a) the Partners understand that the Commission sets the rates, not investors or the \nCompany , and b) the Partners will be investor -owners, and will not make day-to-day decisions \nregarding  what investments need to be made to provide service.  \nWhile the Partners do not have any plan relat ed to future rates —or any ability to implement \na plan if it did exist —it is possible that Minnesota Power’s rates will increase in the future. The \nfundamental purpose of this Acquisition is to ensure that Minnesota Power has sufficient capital \nto make the investments needed for the energy transition. It is undisputed that doing so will require \nsubstantial investment . For example, Minnesota Power forecast s that it must invest $4.6 billion in \nthe next five years. I f these investments are made, they will increase Minnesota Power’s rate base \nand that will have an impact on rates , although that impact is not yet known.  Such increases will \n \n428 See Minn. Stat. § 216B.16.  \n429 See, e.g.,  Ex. LPI -1003, Walters Sur rebuttal at 12 –13, eDocket No. 20253 -216807 -02; Ex. CURE -603, Ellis HCTS \nSurrebuttal at 4 :20–21, eDocket No . 20253 -216818 -10 (referring to [HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n … HCTS INFORMATION ENDS] ). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n\n \n 120 \n not be the result of the Acquisition or decisions by the Partners, but rather the costs of \nimplementing Minnesota policy, including the Carbon Free Standard, and other cost increases to \nmaintain the system and ensure reliability, all of which must be appro ved by the Commission.  \nCritically, these investments will not be made unless the Commission determines they are \nnecessary.430 The Commission must specifically approve the transmission and generation \nresources included in the capital plan. The Commission must also approve any increased spending \nfor distribution projects or O&M projects before they are included in rates. Those dec isions will \nbe based on records developed in other proceedings in the future, and ultimately made  by the \nCommission, as they always have been.  \nMost importantly, whether these investments are made and how they impact rates are \nentirely unrelated to the Acquisition. Minnesota Power’s need to make investments will not change \nbased on who its investors are. The need for new transmission lines, wind f arms, and distribution \npoles , for example,  does not have anything to do with the Partners or this Acquisition. Those costs \nwill be approved by the Commission, or not, without regard to this Acquisition. As a result, the \nquestion of what Minnesota Power’s r ates will be in the future is not relevant to this Acquisition \nand should not be considered when evaluating the public interest.  \n4. The Acquisition Will Not Change the Way that the Commission Establishes \nUtility Return on Equity.  \nWhile Opposing Parties argue that the Acquisition could lead to future requests to increase \nthe ROE,431 those concerns are not relevant to this proceeding and should not factor into the \n \n430 Tr.

CUB -505, Jester Direct at \n18, eDocket No. 20252 -214944 -03. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 121 \n Commission’s evaluation of the Acquisition.432 Rather, those highly fact -specific issues should be \ndetermined in rate case proceedings where the Commission can obtain the factual records needed \nto make ROE decisions. This is not a cost recovery proceeding and Minnesota Power’s ROE is not \nat issue. Any  request to modify Minnesota Power’s approved ROE would need to be addressed in \na separate rate case along with a review of other cost -of-service and ratemaking issues.433 For the \nsame reason, consideration in this proceeding of arguments that the Acquisition should be rejected \nto avoid the risk of future changes to ROE would be premature, would necessarily rely on an \nundeveloped record, and fundamentally would be at odds w ith Commission precedent and the \npolicy against single -issue ratemaking.434 What will happen with Minnesota Power’s ROE in the \nfuture simply is not at issue.  \nAny concerns regarding future ROEs stemming from the Acquisition can and should be \nadequately addressed in the appropriate future ratemaking proceeding.435 Recent Minnesota Power \nrate case orders demonstrate the rigor of the Commission’s ratemaking processes and the \nprotection provided to customers, notwithstanding requests by utilities.436 Nothing about the \nAcquisition or this proceeding changes those processes or the requirement that the Commission \n \n432 As discussed in Section  II.D, supra , Minnesota Power’s approved ROE is different from the return the Partners \nhope to achieve on their investment in ALLETE.  This section addresses the former, ROE, not the latter, the Partners’ \nreturn on investment.  \n433 Ex. MP -19, Bulkley Direct at 11, eDocket No. 202412 -212968 -11. \n434 See, e.g., In the Matter of Northern States Power Company’s Petition for Deferred Accounting Treatment for \nSettlement Payments from SMMPA , Docket No. E -002/M -96-1623, Order Allowing Withdrawal of Petition at 8 (Sept. \n17, 1997), eDocket No. 239523 . \n435 See, e.g. , Ex. DOC -303, Addonizio Direct at 53:15 -21, eDocket No. 20252 -214941 -01 (“Because of the nature of \nhow the required return on equity is estimated in utility rate cases, the Commission will likely be able to mitigate the \neffects of potential increases in Minnesota Power’s cost of equity …. For this reason, I agree with Ms. Bul kley’s \nconclusion that the methods the Commission has historically relied on to determine Minnesota Power’s authorized \nreturn on equity will still be reasonable to use post -Acquisition.”); id. at 74:8 -12 (“the authorized return on equity that \ngets reflected in Minnesota Power’s rates will only rise as a result of the Acquisition if the return on equity witnesses \nmodel it differently”).  \n436 These  procedures are discussed in Section II.B, supra . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n 122 \n must approve the utility’s ROE. Nothing about the Acquisition or this proceeding changes the \nCommission’s authority to determine the appropriate ROE in a future rate case either.  \nThe fact of the Acquisition also does not change how ROE will be determined in any future \nproceeding. As Department Witness Addonizio confirmed, “the methods the Commission has \nhistorically relied on to determine Minnesota Power’s authorized return on equi ty will still be \nreasonable to use post -Acquisition.”437 That means that just as before the Acquisition, after the \nAcquisition the Commission will determine the appropriate ROE for Minnesota Power based on \nthe risk the Company faces on a stand -alone basis, n ot based on the owner of the Company or the \nsource of funds it uses to operate.438 That determination can be made when the question of the \nappropriate ROE for Minnesota Power is at issue , but t hat is not this proceeding.  \nL. The Partners are Committed to Minnesota ’s Environmental Policies  Including \nthe Carbon Free Standard . \nSierra Club suggests that one risk of the Acquisition is that the Partners are not committed \nto Minnesota’s environmental policy goals by raising concerns that the Partners are not committed \nto the Carbon Free Standard or to the already -established dates on which the Boswell Energy \nCenter (“BEC”) will cease coal operations.439 These concerns are misplaced. The record contains \nsubstantial evidence demonstrating the environmental priorities of the Partners. Further, the \nspecific issues raised by Sierra Club hav e already been decided by the Minnesota Legislature and \nthe Commission, and the Partners could not change them even if they wanted to.  \nThe Partners are committed to supporting Minnesota Power’s investment in the clean \nenergy transition. The Partners have made this clear throughout the proceeding. Witness Alley \n \n437 Ex. DOC -303, Addonizio Direct at 53:18 –22, eDocket No. 20252 -214941 -01. \n438 Ex.

As Witness Alley explained,  the Company’s needs regarding “energy transition efforts \nto meet Minnesota’s clean energy requirements, broader electrification trends and building \nresiliency through transmission investments” are “key areas of focus for CPP Investments,” as \nthey “involve  opportunities for CPP Investments to deploy capital in support of a long -term growth \nstrategy that CPP Investments believes will generate value over the life of its investment .”442 As \nexplained in t he Petition , decarbonization is central to GIP’s investment thesis.443 Witness Bram \nfurther explained that “[t]he acceleration of climate action, decarbonization, and energy transition \nare at the core of GIP’s approach to investment.”444 While the Partners each have demonstrated \ngoals related to clean energy and climate action, it also makes good business sense —as explained \nby Witness Bram, “GIP focuses on investments in these areas because GIP has determined that \nthey present opportuniti es to deploy large amounts of capital that will result in long -term, stable \nreturns for investors.”445 In other words, the Partners have an incentive to support the energy \ntransition because doing so is a good investment.  \nThe Partners have the experience to help Minnesota Power accomplish its energy \ntransition.  Both Partners  have extensive experience supporting the deployment of renewable \n \n440 Ex. MP -13, Alley Direct at 13:15 -17, eDocket No. 202412 -212968 -10. \n441 Ex.

Based on their previous experiences \nsupporting the deployment of renewable resources, the Partners fully understand the magnitude of \nMinnesota Power’s transition and the resources required to accomplish this task.  \nIn fact, it was Minnesota Power’s decarbonization plans that drew the Partners to ALLETE \nand Minnesota Power. As Witness Bram testified:  \nGIP's decision to  pursue the Acquisition is directly tied to Minnesota Power's plan to \ndecarbonize its generation fleet while investing concurrently in its transmission and \ndistribution systems  in order to deliver this decarbonized power to its customers and \ncomply with Minnesota's Carbon Free Standard policy.446 \n \nSimilarly, Witness Alley noted that an investment into ALLETE ali gns with CPP Investments’ \nsustainability and decarbonization goals:  \nCPP Investments’ plan to meet its sustainability and carbon reduction goals involves both \nits own operations as well as its portfolio. Two of the principles supporting the portfolio \ngoals are (i) investing for a whole economy transition and (ii) supporting  responsible \ntransition. The goals of companies like ALLETE align with these principles.447  \n \nSierra Club has it exactly backward. The Partners have no intention to deviate from Minnesota \nPower’s clean energy plans. In fact, the Partners are interested in Minnesota Power because  of its \ncommitment to the clean energy transition.  \n These preferences are supported by the Partners’ internal  documents as well . As explained \nin the Response Testimony of Witness Bram, [HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS …  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n446 Ex. MP -14, Bram Direct at 15:16–20, eDocket No. 202412 -212968 -09. \n447 Ex.

In fact, the record contains \nspecific evidence demonstrating that is not the Partners’ preference, both because the Partners are \ncommitted to the energy transition and because it makes good business sense. Further, as discussed \nin more detail below, the Partners fully recognize that it is the Commission, not the Par tners, that \nwill make the decisions ab out how to achieve the Carbon Free Standard.  \nSierra Club’s concerns are also misplaced because decisions related to Minnesota Power’s \nfuture resource acquisitions and how to comply with the Carbon Free Standard  will be made by \n \n449 Ex.

The Partners \nhave not made any commitments about how to best meet the Carbon Free Standard because the \nPartners understand that the Commission is going to make those deci sions based on extensive \nrecord development and stakeholder engagement —including engagement from Sierra Club. The \nPartners have , however,  committed to ensuring that Minnesota Power has the equity capital it \nneeds to effectuate the Commission’s decisions.  \nIn fact, the decisions related to coal operations at BEC have already been made. The \nCommission established a specific timeline to cease coal operations at Boswell in Minnesota \nPower’s last IRP.454 The idea that the Partners would invest in Minnesota Power with the hopes \nthat the Commission would reverse this decision makes no sense and, as noted above, ceasing coal \noperations at Boswell is entirely consistent with the Partners’ preferences and inve stment thesis.  \nNotwithstanding the Commission’s order and the Commission’s clear authority to enforce its own \norders, the Sierra Club maintains its concern that there  is a risk to the retirement schedule for the \nBoswell units.455 Witness Lane bemoans that “ Partners have not stated a binding, enforceable \ncommitment to coal plant retirement dates in the Merger Agreement or elsewhere .”456 However, \nit is not clear what would be more “binding” and “enforceable” than a Commission order . \nUltimately, there should be no disputes related to BEC because the Commission has already \ndecided the issue.  \n \n454 In the Matter of Minnesota Power’s 2021 -2035 Integrated Resource Plan , Docket No. E -015/RP -21-33, ORDER \nAPPROVING PLAN AND SETTING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS  at Order Point 2 (Jan. 9, 2023), eDocket No. 20231 -\n191970 -01. \n455 Ex.

As Witness Cady \ntestified, the Acquisition will not change  the Commission’s oversight and Minnesota Power will \nremain fully regulated by the Commission. As such, all Minnesota Power resource decisions, \nincluding those associated with the Nemadji Trail Energy Center, will be made by the Commission \nas part of an IR P proceeding, resource acquisition docket, or cost recovery proceeding. Minnesota \nPower recently updated the Commission on plans associated with the Nemadji Trail Energy Center \nin its 2025 -2039 Integrated Resource Plan which is currently before the Commiss ion in Docket \nNo. 25 -127.458 \nCONCLUSION  \n For all of the foregoing  reasons, the Acquisition is consistent with the public interest and \nshould be approved. ALLETE and Minnesota Power need to significantly increase investments to \ncontinue providing safe, reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy to customers. Rel ying \non public markets for equity capital would be very risky for customers, and the Acquisition will \navoid that risk. The Acquisition will also allow the Company to benefit from the Partners’ \nexpertise, and provide the additional benefits from  the Petitioners’ commitments.

The law, while historic, contains several \nconcessions that make compliance with the 100-percent -carbon -free-by-2040 standard \n(CFS) easier , including the ability to offset carbon -heavy electrical production with credits \nfrom other jurisdictions.1 The Minnesota Public Utility Commission’s (Commission) ability \nto punish utilities for noncompliance with fines is effectively limited to however much it \nwould cost to buy such credits.2 The Commission also is charged with administering what \nhas been called an “off ramp,” allowing for modification or delay of the CFS “if the \ncommission determines that modifying or delaying the standard obligation is in the public \ninterest.”3  \n In this proceeding the Commission is presented with potential new utility owners  \nsuggesting that they offer  the only way that one of Minnesota’s utilities could possibly \ncomply with the CFS  standard. These are not companies that possess a history  of experience \nin administering Minnesota regulated utilities, rather they bring wealth y investors , and an \nintention to create more wealth for those investors . The companies seeking to control \nMinnesota Power  (MP) , Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and Global \nInfrastructure Partners (GIP) (collectively “the Partners”), view MP’s parent company, \nALLETE, as an attractive investment for their private equity clients. Utilities are historically \n \n1 Minn. Stat.  § 216B.1691 , Subd. 4(b)  (2024 ). \n2 Id. at Subd. 7  (Stating in part: “The penalty may not exceed the lesser of the cost of \nconstructing facilities or purchasing credits.” ). \n3 Id. at Subd. 2b.  \n \n \n \n 4 good investments;  they produce reliable returns and have the legal right to engage in \nmonopolistic business  under the oversight of the Commission . The Partners have done \nquite a lot of analysis and have decided that this deal is a good one , for them.  \n However, the Commission does not exist to support the interests  of private \ninvestors, it exists to assure reliable and affordable service to the public by Minnesota’s \nregulated utilities. In this case it can only approve the takeover of ALLETE by the Partners \nif the transaction is cons istent wi th the public interest and the company to be sold has been \ncorrectly valued.4 If the transaction is not consistent with the public interest , it must be \nrejected.  \n The Partners and ALLETE  (collectively “the Applicants”) argue that  MP’s duties \nunder  the CFS necessitate this deal, and that only through this deal can MP comply with \nthe law and invest the necessary equity to decarbonize its energy generation. The reasoning \nof this application invites  the Commission to gamble on the possibility  that only these two \nowners will be able to guide MP through the transformation required by Minnesota’s \nhistoric 2023 law.  \nHowever, evidence in the record shows that that gamble is a serious risk to \nMinnesota and to MP’s  customers. Putting all MP’s  eggs in this basket risks cutting off: \nother sources of funding; information from public reporting that is currently required of \nthe utility and benefits the Commission and the public; the consistent services provided by \nMP’s  current workforce; and the access the MP now has to additional f unding through \n \n4 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 , Subd. 1  (2024).  \n \n \n \n 5 public markets . This transaction risks saddling a Minnesota utility with large amounts of \ndebt —debt that ultimately will be paid by MP customers one way or another. This \ntransaction also increases the risk of bankruptcy, an occurrence that is thankfully rare \namong utilities , but has been caused by private equity owners in the recent past. Despite \nthe Applicants’ arguments otherwise , all of this additional risk and the Partners’ avowed \nprofit interests also risk the viability of MP meeting the CFS on the expected timeline.  \n For these reasons the Commission should reject this deal and encourage the \nApplicants to rethink the high amounts of profit they seek, and whether or not they should \ninvest their money elsewhere rather than putting strain and increasing risk on a Minnesot a \nutility and its customers.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \n \nMinnesota Statute § 216B.50 , Subd ivision  1, mandates that no public utility can sell, \ntransfer, or merge assets or securities valued at $1,000,000 or more without prior approval \nfrom the Commission. The Commission’s analysis for any such  approval is straightforward: \nit must find that the proposed transaction is “consistent with the public interest.”5  This \nstatutory language entrusts the Commission with the significant responsibility to ensure \nthat utility mergers and acquisitions genuinely serve Minnesota’s public, not mer ely private \ninvestors.  \nThe Commission has long interpreted the public  interest standard through a \nbalancing test, carefully weighing the harms and benefits of any proposed action  along with \n \n5 Id. \n \n \n \n 6 the method used to reach the agreement .6 The standard demands that the proposed \ntransaction does not conflict  with or contravene interests such as affordability, reliability, \ntransparency, and sound financial management of a public, regulated ut ility. In practical \nterms, this means that the Commission evaluates several critical factors: impacts on \ncustomer rates, potential risks to service  reliability , changes to market power, the financial \nintegrity o f the utility post -acquisition, and the continued effectiveness of regulatory \noversight.7  \nThe Commission’s past merger and acquisition decisions consistently  demonstrate \nthat satisfying the public interest standard requires more than just avoiding harm; it \nrequires  credible, enforceable commitments that pr oduce  concrete benefits.8 Similarly, the \n \n6 See, e.g., Order Approving Acquisition, with Conditions, In re Request for Approval of the \nAcquisition by MDU Res. Grp., Inc., and Great Plains Nat. Gas Co. of Cascade Nat. Gas \nCorp. , Docket No. G-004/PA -06-1585, at 2 , 8, eDockets Document No. 3943867 ; Order \nApproving Merger and Adopting Amended Stipulation with Modifications, In re Proposed \nMerger of Minnegasco, Inc. with and into Arkla, Inc. , at 5, e Docket s Document  No. 403630  \n(“The Commission did more than examine a balance sheet of possible costs and benefits \nof the merger. It also evaluated the process by which the parties arrived at a stipulation to \npresent to the Commission.”).  \n7 Id.; see also  Order Approving Merger Subject to Conditions, In re Request for Approval of \nthe Merger Agreement Between Integrys Energy Group, Inc. and Wisconsin Energy \nCorporation , at 5, eDocket s Document  No. 20156 -111752 -01. \n8 In the 2000 merger of Northern States Power and New  Century Energies to form Xcel \nEnergy, the Commission’s approval was based on  a package of customer protections and \nsafeguards. These included a guaranteed immediate rate cut, a five -year base rate freeze, \nand (soon after)  binding commitments that Minne sota ratepayers would never subsidize \nthe u tility’s unregulated or foreign ventures.  The Commission also required public \nreporting on generation and commitments  to CO2 mitigation. Taken together, these \nprovisions demonstrate d not just an absence of harm but a desire to ensure that  the deal \nwas in alignment with the long -term public interest.  See Order Approving Merger, as \nConditioned, In re Application Northern States Power  Co. for Approval to merge with New \nCentury Energies, Inc. , eDocket s Document  No. 789046 .  \n \n \n \n 7 Commission has consistently required a clear showing that ratepayers would not fund any \npart of the acquisition premium or transaction costs.9 These require ments further reflect \nthe Commission’s broad scope in protecting the public interest . The Commission hasn’t \njust sought to mitigate financial impacts ; they’ve affirmatively sought to protect both \ncontinuity in service  and organizational transparency . \nMinnesota Statute § 216B.50 establishes that the valuation of the asset to be \ntransferred is an essential element  of any showing that the proposal is “consistent with the \npublic interest.” The  Commission “ shall take into consideration the reasonable value of the \nproperty, plant, or securities to be acquired or disposed of .”10 Historically,  the Commission \nhas refrained from relying solely on applicants’ submissions and instead expects robust \nevidence and independent analysis from intervenors and expert witnesses to inform its \njudgments.11 Where an acqui sition price significantly exceeds book or market value, the \nCommission has required that such premium will not adversely impact ratepayers or \nundermine the utility’s ability to deliver reliable service at reasonable rates.12 \n \n  \n \n9 But beyond those financial protections, the Commission evaluated the 2015 Wisconsin \nEnergy Corporation ’s acquisition  of Minnesota Energy Resources Corporation  (MERC ) for \npotential effects on service quality, workforce stability, and MERC ’s post -merger capital \nstructure. It approved the transaction only after incorporating  conditions that ensured \nMERC would remain financially sound, adequately staffed, and subject to full Minnesota \nregulatory oversight. See supra , note 7, Order  Approving Merger Subject to Conditions .  \n10 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 .  \n11 Supra note 6,  Order Approving Merger and Adopting Amended Stipulation with \nModifications . \n12 Id.  \n \n \n \n 8 ANALYSIS  \nI. The Applicants have not demonstrated any benefit to customers or \nMinnesota  \n \nNowhere in this record have the Applicants proven that this transaction is necessary \nfor MP to continue to provide reliable and affordable electrical service in the years to come. \nThis alone should cause the Commission to look at this transaction with serious skepticism, \nas it cannot proceed if there is not evidence  that the  acquisition is consistent with the \npublic interest. Testimony offered by CURE’s experts help to further illustrate the failure of \nthe Applicant’s submissions and witnesses to make a plausible case.  \n Mr. Ellis, a former utility executive with decades of experience leading energy \nstrategy for  Sempra Energy, McKinsey & Company, and ExxonMobil ,13 found that \n“proceeding with this transaction would obfuscate and exacerbate” the cost of meeting the \nstate’s CFS,14 ostensibly the applicants’ main justification for the transaction.  His detailed \nanalysis shows that without a n updated  and accurate  valuation including  a reassessment \nof the authorized Return on Equity (ROE) for Minnesota Power (MP) , this transaction will \npush  the ratepayer  burden  for capital spending  40 percent higher than what is reasonable  \nor needed .15 This mean s that customers  will be excessively burdened , and MP’s new owners \nwill be excessively incentivized to maximize capital spending regardless of the \nenvironmental  benefit  from such overspending .16 He concludes : “In short, [this transaction \ncreates] the potential for a MP customer [triple]-whammy  — higher rates, rising faster, for \n \n13 See Ex. CURE -601 (Schedule ME -1, Statement of Qualifications of Mark E. Ellis ). \n14 Ex.

CURE submitted relevant discovery \nrequests to Applicant witnesses regarding their criticisms of Mr. Ellis’s economic analysis, \nbut other than offering critiques of the tone that Mr. Ellis took, their responses largely did \nnot engage with the substance of his points that ROE and valuation are key issues that the \nCommission must assess in order to assure this acquisition is not contrary to the public \ninterest.18 \n Mr. Ellis  noted that in the past nine  years MP ’s electric  rates have increased much \nfaster than in flation —a full 2.3 times the inflation rate and much more than utilit ies as a \nwhole19—and he provided considerable  analysis of future rate impacts that will be \nattributable to this transaction.  It is important to note that much of Mr. Ellis ’s analysis is \nveiled behind  Highly Confidential Trade Secret  (HCTS ) status , a designation made by the \nApplicants for much of the relevant documents in this case,  because it would have been \nimpossible for him to do the ne cessary calculations on rate impacts withou t accessing this \ninformation.

Agreeing with  BlackRock ’s CEO on t he topic  of aligning \nretirement investment in energy companies , Mr. Ellis testified  that funding utility \ninvestment using Competitive Direct Equity  (CDE ) rather than exclusive  equity  lockups  \ncould serve Commissions, customers,  and priva te equity retirement fund investors alike.20  \n Mr. Baker, an expert on private equity who leads an organization that provides \ninformation and analysis of the social and environmental impacts  of private investors’  \nacquisition and restructuring of businesses  and infrastructure,21 similarly found that the \nproposed acquisition would not likely provide any of the benefits asserted in  Applicant  \nsubmissions and  testimony . Based on information in this record and research and available \ninformation on private equity investment, Mr. Baker found that this transaction could \n \n20 Ex. CURE -601 ( Mark Ellis Direct Testimony ), at 58 (discussing BlackRock CEO ’s \nstatement ), 51–62 (regarding CDE ). While the Commission likely could not impose CDE \nas a condition of this acquisition, there is some value in understanding how it could have \nbeen structured so as to not misalign the incentives of owners and customers, and to set \nfinancial expectations accu rately to assure continued investment without extracting \nexcessive profits from customers. Rejecting this application as contrary to the public \ninterest does not prevent the Applicants from returning with a changed proposal that \naligns better with Minnesot a’s needs, customer protection, and with a large number of \nprivate equity investors overseeing retirement accounts.  \n21 Ex.

CURE believes that the Commission should take this opportunity \nto affirm that for something to be “consistent with the public interest” it must substantially \nand meaningfully benefit  the public , not merely be non -harmful to utility customers and \nother interests of Minnesotans . The Commission’s overall mission is to serve the public, \nnot to merely passively observe as legal monopolies extract value from Minnesota \nbusinesses  and residential customers. In accordance with the agency’s public  mission, it is \nappropriate to set a high bar that requires improvement with every approved utility \ntransaction over $1,000,000 in value.  \n  \n \n22 Ex.

The proposed acquisition  will harm customers and Minnesota  \nA. The Applicant s’ valuation  of Minnesota Power is inflated, leading to an \nexcessive  purchase price for ALLETE, aggravated by a large premium  \n \nIn order to comply with the legislature’s requirements that this transaction be \n“consistent with the public interest” the Commission is tasked with taking “ into \nconsideration the reasonable value of the property, plant, or securities to be acquired or \ndisposed of .”25 This requirement makes logical sense : without knowing what the value of \nMP is the Commission cannot assure that captured customers are well served by the \nfinancial implications of the transaction. Stated another way, if the price is too high and \ncustomers will have to bear the risk or cost associated with that incorrect valuation, then \nthis acquisition cannot be consistent with the public interest.  \nThis is why the Applicants ’ witness testimony regarding ROE is blatantly incorrect  \nwhen it states  that COE/ ROE issues are not germane to this proceeding.26 Without first \naddressing excessive ROE it is not possible for the Commission to assess the reasonable \nvalue of the transaction and determine whether it is in the public interest.  \nMr. Ellis’s testimony demonstrates that the proposed acquisition overvalues the \ncompany by approximately $1.5 billion .27 This windfall  will go to  ALLETE’s current owners, \ntheir public shareholders, and will only be recoverable from the customers who are left \nbehind to deal with the Partners as the new owners of MP. As Mr. Ellis explained:  \nNo witness disputes that ALLETE shareholders will be walking away with a \n$1.5-billion  profit over rate base value if this transaction proceeds.  As I have \n \n25 Minn. Stat. 216B.50 , Subd. 1.  \n26 See, e.g., Ex. MP -38 (Anne Bulkley Rebuttal  Testimony – Cost of Capital  \nDevelopment),  at 19.  \n27 Ex. CURE -601 (Mark Ellis Direct Testimony), at 21, n.26.  \n \n \n \n 13 just demonstrated, unless  the Commission reduces MP ’s ROE significantly in \nother regulatory proceedings, this profit  will ultimately come out of \ncustomers ’ pockets. We should ask ourselves: What have  ALLETE ’s current \nowners and managers done to deserve this windfall?28 \n \nIt cannot be that the current owners of MP deserve such a large payout merely because the \nCFS has changed utility management  for all utilities, nor  can they deserve this me rely \nbecause they sought and found private equity  buyers  who plan to squee ze out higher profits \nthan p ublic owners would have .29 \nWithout properly valuing this company the Commission may be put in a similar no -\nwin situation that befell the regulators of UPPCO in Michigan. In a schedule to Mr. Baker’s \ntestimony, an analysis  by Incident Energy LLC  titled “Understanding the Upper Peninsula \nPower Company Dilemma” lays out how Michigan’s Public Service Commission “has been \ndoomed to play a reoccurring role as [UPPCO ’s] regulator[.] ”30 The analysis describes \nUPPCO’s initial 2014 private equity purchase  proposal for stock with a  price $14.2 million \nabove book value, but ultimately the deal w as for UPPCO on an asset basis at a premium \nof $52.1 million above book value.31 The report provides analysis of why a cquiring the utility \nat a “substantial price for UPPCO over its book value” with a “substantial amount of debt ,” \nwould  lead to financial danger if the utility’s future cash flow is not sufficient to cover debt  \nfor both the utility and its parent company’s  debt from the acquisition.32  \n \n28 Ex.

CURE -600 (Schedule JB -4), at 1. \n31 Id. at 27.  \n32 Id. at 52.  \n \n \n \n 14 It turns out that this analy st’s report from  2019 has been predictive of UPPCO ’s \ncontinuing poor perform ance regarding maintain ing stability and reasonable rates. \nFollowing the 2014  acquisition of  UPPCO by private  equity  its rates have continued to climb \nrapidly, and the utility was resold within nine years  to another private equity owner  who \nhas sought even higher rates .33 The high valuation of UPPCO in 2014 and sale to private \nequity owners with distinct interests that do not align well with customer interests  \nsubsequently put Michigan ’s state regulator in a difficult position in future rate cases and \nacquisition dockets —the original purchase price and su bsequent  incentives of the owners \nled to outcomes that have been contrary to the public interest.   \nIt is true that in order to properly value this and other utilities going forward, the \nCommission will also need to reassess  economic  analysis in other dockets. But the fact that \nthe Commission is tasked with making sound judgements in rate cases in no way absolves \nit of the need to do so in this docket  as well . To the extent that the Applicants ’ witnesses \nwould prefer that the Commission merely take the sale price as a fact and not question \nwhether it is too high, this is contrary to what the legislature has tasked the Commission \nwith doing . In order to value this company correctly, an d allow it to operate optimally for \nits customers going forward, the Commission should take this opportunity to set its value \nconsistent with book value, and begin a process of reevaluating excessive ROE assumptions \nthat may have been made in the past.  \n  \n \n33 Ex. CURE -600 (Jim Baker Direct Testimony), at 13 –16.  \n \n \n \n 15 B. Private equity investment normally seeks short -term excessive profits through \npredictable risky behaviors  \n \nWhen private equity companies invest in energy companie s and utilities, the \ninvestors’ unique set of interests do not naturally align with stable and reliable utility \noutcomes for customers. Private equity investors seek profits in excess of regulated utilities ’ \nauthorized rates of return, and value short term cash flow above long -term viability and \npredictability of utility performance.  \nMr. Baker’s testimony and materials he cites lay  out this conundrum —private equity \ncompanies, including private infrastructure investors like the Partners, seek to extract high \nprofits out of entities they only own for a short hold period.34 In the case of GIP V, the fund \nused to acquire ALLETE, the target return is 15 to 20 percent , considerably above a utility’s \nnormal authorized rate of return.35 Additionally, GIP V  only has a hold period of 10 years \nplus two one -year extensions, and that hold period includes both the time to acquire a \ncompany and the actual ownership years —with ownership lasting on average 4 -6 years.36 \nThese types of investors  then, in addition to any debt used for the acquisition, regularly \nengage in “dividend recapitalization” which is  producing  dividends for investors with debts \nplaced on the acquired company.37 Large short -term profits are therefore possible through \n \n34 Id. at 3-4.  \n35 Id. at 21. \n36 Id. at 5-6 (discussing average hold periods  for private equity firms ); Ex.

The precedent set by approving this transaction would endanger other \nMinnesota utilities  and their customers  in the impending energy transition  \n \nWhile this acquisition presents a novel kind of utility ownership for Minnesota’s \nregulated utilities, it may set a precedent that the Commission will be forced to deal with  \n \n46 Id. at 10.  \n47 Id. at 10 -12.  \n48 Id. at 12.  \n49 See Ex.

This acquisition foreshadows  a new frequency of \ncomplex  utility sales that the Commission may increasingly have to deal with as investors \nlike the Partners seek to maximize their infrastructure holdings.  \nTwo main issues seem likely to be guided by any decision in this transaction: data \ncenter development ; and the overall cost of the CFS for Minnesotans who are served by \nregulated utilities .  \ni. Data centers  \n \nAs discussed in Mr. Baker’s surrebuttal testimony, GIP’s parent firm, BlackRock, has \npledged a large amount of its resources to data center development in the next few years.51 \nIn recently reported rema rks BlackRock Senior Managing Director  and board member52 \n(and GIP CEO)  Adebayo Ogunlesi , indicated that GIP was going to be a leader in financing \nand building data centers, partially because of BlackRock’s ownership stake in all relevant \ncompanies who intend to build such infrastructure going forward.53 Mr. Ogunlesi  indicated \nthat 60 percent of the hyperscaler data centers he planned to  build would be in the  United \n \n51 Ex.

Notably, in this proceeding, MP \nhas asserted that it should be allowed to keep its prior rate forecasts trade secret  partly  \nbecause releasing such information “will directly affect the  Company’s ability to attract new \ncustomers and impact future contract negotiations .”55 Even more directly,  the company \ngoes on to say: “ Electric  utilities throughout Minnesota are working to attract new, large \ncommercial customers, such as  data centers, to their service territories. ”56 Based on the \n \n54 Id.  \n55 See Minnesota Power’s Response in Opposition to the Office of the Attorney General – \nResidential Utilities Dividson’s Motion To Lift Trade Secret Designation s, In the Matter of \nthe Petition of Minnesota Power for the Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners , OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40399, \nMPUC Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198, MPUC Docket No. E -015/M -24-383, Mar. 31, 2025, \neDocket s Document  No. 20253 -217020 -01. \n56 Id.

The report “Extracting Profits from \nthe Public: How Utility Ratepayers are Paying for Big Tech’s Power ,” attached to Mr. Baker’s \nsurrebuttal testimony, explains how data centers’ disproportionate market power already \nlikely results in other utility customers covering a disproportionate amount of costs for \ndata center infrastructure buildout.57 \nThe problems with  a data center ’s ability to get favorable deals from utilities and \nexternalize costs are difficult to overstate, but the report summarizes them in this way:  \nDetecting wealth transfers from ratepayers to utility shareholders and Big \nTech companies is  particularly challenging because utilities ask PUCs for \nconfidential treatment of their  contracts with data centers, which limits \nscrutiny of utilities’ proposed deals and narrows the  scope of regulators’ \noptions when they consider utilities’ prices and terms. Meanwhile,  regulators \nface political pressure to approve major economic investments already \ntouted by  elected officials for their economic impacts. Rejecting new data \ncenter contracts could lead  potential Big Tec h customers to construct their \nfacilities in other states. Indeed, Big Tech  companies have repeatedly told \nutility regulators that unfavorable utility rates could lead  them to invest \nelsewhere.58 \n \nIn light of the power  imbalance  described in their research , the  authors  generally despair \nof being able to control the influence of “trillion -dollar software and social media \ncompanies” and assert that : “The very same rate structures that have socialized the costs of  \nreliable power delivery are now forcing the public to pay for infrastructure designed to \n \n57 See Ex. CURE -602 (Schedule JB -6). \n58 Id. at 2. \n \n \n \n 21 supply  a handful of exceedingly wealthy corporations. ”59 They quote a transmission utility’s \nestimate that a single data center with a behind -the-meter generation source may pass \nalong between $58 million and $140 million of transmission and distribution costs to other \ncustomers ,60 and PJM ’s consistent statement  that co -locating data centers with generation \ncould undermine its markets.61  \nThe authors also warn  that state  regulators may be missing the current ties being \nformed between data centers and utilities that will have  negative  impacts  on other \ncustomers  down the road,62 and they identify that the exponential growth promised by data \ncenter development decreases utility interest in important efforts  such as distributed \ngeneration deployed to lower costs and increasing efficiency through  transmission \ninfrastructure improvement.63 Even without data center developers being tied to the \nowners of the relevant utilities, these projects reflect an outsized amount of political and \nmarket power , which will make the Commission’s task of keeping regular customer rates \nreasonable increasingly difficult.  \nAs a result  of the data center boom , and Black Rock /GIP ’s part in it , this proposed \nacquisition poses  an additional  novel conflict of interest that puts the Commission at the \ncenter of entities either owned  by, or with a financial relationship  to, BlackRock. If GIP, an \naffiliate entity of BlackRock, owns and directs MP and also intends to build as many of \n \n59 Id. at 1, 2.  \n60 Id. at 20.  \n61 Id. at 21.  \n62 Id. at 31.  \n63 Id. at 33.  \n \n \n \n 22 BlackRock’s data centers as possible  in the United States , the same set of entities could very \nwell control both supply and potentially most of the demand for electricity , should a  \nhyper scale data center be proposed in MP territory. To date,  MP has a small set of very \nlarge indus trial customers, and BlackRock also owns a stake in each of these , posing  risk of \nconflicts ,64 but the future conflict of majority ownership of both the electricity seller and a \npotential future largest  electricity  buyer gives new meaning to the private equity “roll up” \nstrategy and  likely  doesn’t have precedents in Minnesota regulation.  \nThis conflict would seemingly accelerate and worsen a risk of externalized costs that \nalready is being reported with data center development , and detailed in the above -cited \nHarvard report , even  in the absence of a private -equity -fueled  conflict of interest.  Given \nthe fact that there is ample testimony showing that taking MP private will remove much of \nthe public reportin g ALLETE currently makes to securities regu lators,65 the conflict would \nalso be harder to oversee and regulate . The Pa rtners will have access to information both \nas utility own ers and as potential  data center develop ers, but the Commission and the \npublic will be cut off from public  filings th at serve to offset informat ion imbalances that \nfavor corporate actors.  \nii. Cost of CFS implementation  \n \nOstensibly, one of the leading justifications  for this acquisition is that MP faces a \nnew reality under the CFS and will need capital in order to transition to 100 percent carbon -\nfree energy by 2040 . However, the CFS does not require decarbonization at any price , it \n \n64 Ex. CURE -600 ( Jim Baker Direct Testimony ), at 28.  \n65 See Ex. CURE -602 ( Jim Baker Surrebuttal Testimony ), at 7 –8.  \n \n \n \n 23 contains offset options as well as “off ramps ” should the Commission approve them . If \nMinnesota utilities only present the  Commission the  most expensive options for energy \ngeneration, it is highly likely that they will either achieve carbon -free energy at too high a \ncost or miss the mark because they do not meet the Commission ’s other goals of \naffordability and r eliability . \nOne clear way for the Commission to make such default or cost -overrun s less likely \nwould be to assure that every dollar of ratepayer money is having the maximum effect . \nRate s should be reinvested to the maximum,  and not  taken off as excessive profits that will \nnot be used to keep utility bills low  or sustain investment  in low-cost resources .  \nA clear way to move all utilities towards least -cost compliance with the CFS is to \neliminate excessive ROEs and to value MP and other utilities consistent with their book \nvalue. This is explained in detail in a schedule to Mr. Ellis’s testimony, a report he authored \nfor The American Economic Liberties Project  titled “Rate of Return Equals Cost of Capital: \nA Simple, Fair Formula to Stop Investor -Owned Utilities From Overcharging the Public.”66 \nIn the report Mr. Ellis explains that setting rate of return above cost of capital is counter to \nU.S. Supreme Court precedent and unjustly enriches utility investors at the expense of \nutility customers.67 He calculates, on average across all IOUs, “Bringing  RORs into \ncompliance with the regulatory standard would enable every dollar of utility revenue  \ncollected from customers for capital investment to go approximately 25% further — 25% \n \n66 Ex. CURE -601 (Schedule ME -2).  \n67 Id. at 5.  \n \n \n \n 24 more  bang for every customer buck put toward utility investment. ”68 Minnesota, with the \npush in the right direction by the CFS, could really use the additional proverbial bang for \nits ratep ayer bucks ; keeping customer bills as low as possible while achieving carbon free \nenergy by 2040 is made all the more achievable if the Commission resets its past \nprecedents69 on ROE and valuation as described in this report and Mr. Ellis’s testimony in \nthis case.  \nD. Concessions offered by the Applicants are insufficient or illusory , and do not \nmatch the public interest as defined  by public commenters  \n \nThe Applicants lay out commitment s and affirmations in  a schedule to  rebuttal \ntestimony of Jennifer Cady .70 The affirmation s are merely statements regarding e xisting \nstandards  overseen by the Commission and  governed by appli cable law . The commitments  \ndo not redress  the inherent risks,  costs, and harms discussed by CURE and other parties to \nthis case. They also do not respond to th e majority of concerns expressed by the public \nabout this acquisition.71 Most members of the public conceive of “consistent with the public \ninterest ” as an energy service provider that has the wellbeing of their customers and  reliant \n \n68 Id. at 9; see n.39 (providing full calculation demonstrating a potential 25 percent \nincrease in investment).  \n69 For a detailed analysis of these past precedents see Mr. Ellis’s analysis in surrebuttal \ntestimony.  \n70 Ex. MP -27 (Schedule JJC 1).  \n71 Members of the public, many of whom were honest and up front about the funding they \nreceive from MP , have also expressed support for the acquisition .

That board can choose a  manager and should approve labor agreements and sales \nof assets. This should be similar to  the way electric co -ops are run. ”72 This comment is \nechoed t hrou ghout public comments in this record  in statem ents urging the Commission \nto assure that M P continues to be Minnesota owne d and operated.  \nWhile it may not be practicable to p ut the 150,000 small residential  and bu siness \ncustomers into a n electric co -op with the  small number of very large industrial customers, \nit is imp ortant to see that MP’s current customers want an ownership stake in  their \ncompany because they value MP and its role in the region .

CURE -600 (Schedule JB -4), at 61 –71.  \n \n \n \n 26 transmission and generation a ssets could be sep arated  into a leaner company whose profits \nare mor e likely to appeal to investor s. CURE strongly supports any outcome in this case \nthat would lead to more community involvement in clean energy development and \nadoption , especially those that tend towards what MP customer s clearly want —local \ncontrol, accountable  governance , and cooperative ownership and management of the \nutility that serves them.  \nCONCLUSION  \n CURE respectfully requests that the Judge and Commission deny this acquisition as \nbeing contrary to the public interes t. The purchase price exceeds a reasonable value for MP \nand would ultimately b e borne by custo mers through r ates or decre ased utility \nperformance  and financial risk . The risks associated with this transaction are many, and \nthe benefit su ggested by the Applicant s appear s to be flimsy at best, or illus ory at worst. \nMP customers , businesses who rely on MP and it s consistent serv ice, our environment, and \nour future sustainable growth depends on the  Commission upholding the public interest \nand assuring that this transaction is not rubber stamped  without demonstrated benefits for \nMinnesota . \n As much as the CFS is a historic and necessary standard, it is not an absolute, and it \nallows utilities many different paths to achieve  compliance. It will pose many unanticipated \nchallenges for the Commission over the next fifteen years, and potentially beyond. The CFS \nrequires that the energy system clean up, but it doesn’t say with rigid specificity how this \nwill be accomplished. The A pplicants offer a single path for MP as a take -it-or-leave it, \ncostly, and que stionable plan for the n orthland. They are sophisticated investors, and we \n \n \n \n 27 should hol d them to higher standards than they apparently hold themselves. Rejecting this \napplication will allow them to reconsider how they could accomplish the policy of th e CFS  \nand recoup reasonable profits, without harming the public interest.  \n \nDated: May 1, 2025  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ Hudson Kingston    \nHudson B.

They claim that the Acquisition is needed to improve the Company’s access to \ncapital  over the next twenty years , that it will facilitate the Company’s transition to clean energy, \nand that it will not result in higher costs or greater risks for ratepayers. The record evidence \nrefutes each of these conten tions. The Partners do not make a binding commitment to provide the \nCompany with capital or to fund clean energy projects. The Partners do not commit to own the Company for a minimum period. And the Partners’ pursuit of higher returns is likely to drive larger rate increases for customers. The actual terms outlined in the Acquisition agreement and in \nvarious nonpublic documents do not match the rosy story that the Company and Partners present in their public statements. Documents obtained in discovery reveal the Partners’ true intentions, demonstrating the Acquisition’s illusory benefits and profound risks for the Company and its \nratepayers.   \nMinnesota law requires the Commission to evaluate whether the proposed A cquisition is \nin the public interest, weighi ng the transaction’s potential harms against its potential benefits. \nThe evidence in this proceeding, including an analysis conducted by Sierra Club’s expert witness, Courtney Lane of Synapse Energy Economics, shows that the proposed A cquisition is \nlikely to increase costs and risks while offering no benefits for Minnesota Power ratepayers : \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n2 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n First, the A cquisition may delay  the Company’s transition to renewable energy, prolong \noperation of the costly coal -fired  Boswell Generating Station , and threaten the Company’s \ncompliance with Minnesota’s Carbon- Free Standard . Second, the Partners have not committed to \nprovide capital to the Company, creating a risk that they may under-invest in the Company in the \nfuture, and the Company has not demonstrated that this A cquisition is a better alternative to \nobtaining capital on public markets. Third, there is an overinvestment risk as the Partners’ \npursuit of higher returns will likely pressure the Company to engage in excessive capital spending and forego lowest-cost opt ions, resulting in larger rate increases for customers.  Fourth, \nthe Acquisition would reduce local control, as the ALLETE board would be dominated by the Partners, who will likely favor their own interests over ratepayers. Finally, the Acquisition would undermine transparency, as the Partners would not provide financial disclosures comparable to those made by ALLETE.  \nALLETE and the Partners have not demonstrated that the y need the A cquisition  to obtain \ncapital , or that the Acquisition would provide any rate payer benefits, let alone benefits sufficient \nto outweigh the substantial harms and risks that would result from the proposal. Sierra Club therefore recommends that the Commission not approve the proposed A cquisition.  Deals that \nappear too good to be true usually aren’t, and indeed, in this case the Acquisition is not. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS  \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nA. Minnesota Power’s Capital Plans and Access to Capital  \nALLETE is a publicly traded utility company based in Duluth, Minnesota. Minnesota \nPower is an oper ating division of ALLETE that provides electric service to approximately \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n3 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 150,000 customers in a 26,000-square-mile area of central and northern Minnesota.1 Industrial \nratepayers account for approximately two -thirds of the demand served by Minnesota Power.2  \nALLETE’s other regulated operations include Superior Water, Light & Power, an electric, water, \nand gas utility in Wisconsin, and 8 percent ownership in American Transmission Company, an independent transmission company in Wisconsin.\n3  ALLETE also has investments in unregulated \nenergy infrastructure through ALLETE Clean Energy and New Energy Equity.4  \nAs a publicly- traded company, ALLETE currently has many shareholders.5 Minnesota \nPower has a history of successfully accessing capital in public markets since 1950.6 The \nCompany acknowledges that it has been successful in raising capital in public markets and navigating any associated risks.\n7  ALLETE’s 2023 and 2024 Annual Reports each stated that the \nCompany is “ well positioned to meet our financing needs due to adequate operating cash flows, \navailable additional working capital and access to capital markets.”8 \nUnder ALLETE’s 5 -year capital plan outlined in its 2024 Form 10-K, the Company plans \nto more than triple its capital spending to roughly $5 billion ove r the next five years .9 This \n                                                 \n1 Ex.

The Proposed Acquisition  \nALLETE filed a petition with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in July 2024 \nseeking authorization to be acquired by CPP and GIP.15 CPP is an investment management \norganization that manages the Canada Pension Plan Fund.16 GIP is an infrastructure investor that \ninvests in assets across the energy, transport, digital infrastructure, and water and waste \nmanagement  sectors.17 GIP is funding its share of the proposed Acquisition through two funds, \n                                                 \n10 Ex.

Sierra Club has over 14,000 members in Minnesota, many of whom are Minnesota Power customers.\n42 Sierra Club has consistently \nadvocated for Minnesota Power to transition away from coal- fired and gas- fired electricity \ngeneration and invest in affordable, renewable energy sources, and seeks to ensure that Minnesota Power complies with the state’s Carbon Free Standard. \nIII. SUMMARY OF INTERVENO R TESTIMONY  \nSierra Club intervened  in this Commission  proceeding to  evaluate the impacts of the \nproposed Acquisition on ratepayers, and its potential effects on Minnesota Power’s closure of its \n                                                 \n39 Tr.

Ms. Lane ’s direct and surrebuttal testimony concluded that (1) the \nproposed Acquisition may delay the Company’s clean energy transition and coal plant \nretirements, (2) the Company has not shown that the Acquisition is needed to obtain capital, (3) the Acquisition is likely to result in excessive capital spending and higher rate increases, (4) the Acquisition would give the Partners too much control over the ALLETE board, and (5) the Acquisition would reduce transparency.\n44 In short, Ms. Lane  found that the Acquisition is likely \nto result in costs and risks for ratepayers, and that the Company has not shown any need f or the \nAcquisition  or that it would provide any ratepayer benefits.45 Ms. Lane concluded that the likely \nharms of the proposed A cquisition exceed any possible benefits.46 Ms. Lane elaborated on these \nconcerns during her testimony a t the evidentiary hearing o n April 3, 2025.47   \nMany other expert witnesses raised similar concerns in their testimony .

The \nCommission has denied acquisitions where it finds that the harms outweigh the benefits. For example, the Commission denied Xcel Energy’s petition to acquire the Mankato Energy Center, concluding that the acquisition “has not been shown to be consistent with the public interest” because “[t]he potential costs to ratepayers are to o high, and the potential benefits too uncertain, \nto support the purchase.”\n59Accordingly, in this proceeding, the Commission must weigh \npotential benefits against potential risks or harms to ratepayers that could result from the Acquisition.  \nThe Company argues that it need not show an affirmative public benefit, and that it only \nmust show the Acquisition would not cause a net harm.\n60 But the Company bears the burden to \nshow that the A cquisition is consistent with the public interest.61 If the Co mpany fails to \ndemonstrate that the Acquisition would provide public benefits, then any showing of potential harms or risks would provide a basis to reject the transaction. Moreover, Commission precedent shows that the Commission does  consider whether a pr oposed transaction would provide \n                                                 \n58 In the Matter of the Proposed Merger of Minnegasco, Inc. with and into Arkla, Inc ., Docket \nNo. G008/PA-90-604, Order Approving Merger and Adopting Amended Stipulation with \nModifications, 4 (Minn.

To meaningfully evalua te the proposed Acquisition, the Commission must consider \nwhether it would provide net public benefits. \nARGUMENT  \nThe record in this case —including the Company’s own statements as well as the \ntestimony of Witness Lane and other intervenor witnesses—shows that the proposed Acquisition \nis likely to increase costs and risks while offering no benefits for Minnesota ratepayers . First, the \nAcquisition may delay Minnesota Power’s transition to renewable energy, prolong operation of \nthe costly coal -fired Bosw ell Generating Station, and threaten the Company’s compliance with \nthe Carbon Free Standard. Second, the Partners have not committed to provide capital to the Company, and the Company has not demonstrated that this A cquisition is a better alternative to \nobtaining capital on public markets. Third, the Partners’ pursuit of higher returns would likely pressure the Company to engage in excessive capital spending and forego lowest-cost options, resulting in larger rate increases for customers. Fourth, the Acquisition would reduce local control, as the ALLETE board would be dominated by the Partners, who will likely favor their \n                                                 \n62See N.

Comm’n Nov. 5, 2020) (finding acquisition consistent with public interest because it would provide “quantifiable benefits to ratepayers that exceed the cost of the acquisition, which would not occur but for the acquisition”); see also  Ex.

Finally, the Acquisition would undermine transparency, as the \nPartners would not provide financial disclosures comparable to those made by ALLETE.  \n \nI. THE ACQUISITION COULD THREATEN THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO \nCOMPLY WITH THE CARBON FREE STANDARD AND INCREASE THE RISK OF DELAYED CLOSURE OF THE BOSWELL COAL UNITS . \nThe Company and the Partners claim that the A cquisitio n is intended to finance the \nCompany’s transition to clean energy and have pointed to the need to comply with the Carbon \nFree Standard as a justification for the A cquisition. But the actual terms of the Acquisition do not \nmatch this rhetoric: the Partners do not commit to achieve the emissions reductions called for by the Carbon Free Standard as a condition of the A cquisition , nor do they commit to finance any \nparticular amount of clean energy. Moreover, t he Acquisition could harm Minnesota Power’s \nability to comply with the Carbon Free Standard in several ways. First, while the Partners currently claim to support Minnesota Power’s planned transition to clean energy sources, there is a risk that the Partners’ goals may shift away from clean energy, and there is no guarantee that the Partners will not seek to change the Company’s planned coal retirement dates after the Acquisition is complete. Second, the Partners could sell the Company before the Boswell coal units are retired, and the Company’s next owners may not commit to a clean energy transition.  \nGiven the lack of firm commitments in the Acquisition agreement and the uncertainties associated with the A cquisition, there is a r isk that the Company’s planned energy transition may \nbe much less “clean” than the Company claims.  \nA. The Partners H ave Not Made a B inding Commitment to Achieve the Carbon Free \nStandard. \nThroughout the application and testimony, the Company and the Partners repeatedly \nclaim that they are committed to achieving the clean energy transition needed to meet the Carbon \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n15 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Free Standard  and that the Acquisition will enable the Company to comply with the standard.63 \nBut d espite this extensive rhetoric, the Company and Partners have not made a binding \ncommitment to achieve the standard . Nowhere in the application  or testimony do the Company \nor Partners make an enforceable commitment to achieve the emissions reductions mandated by \nthe standard , nor is that commitment contained in the Acquisition agreement or term sheet . The \nlist of affirmations in Witness Cady’s Rebuttal testimony simply says that the Company will make “efforts to achieve” the Carbon Free Standard.\n64 Promising to try  to achieve a standard \ndoes not guarantee that the Company will achieve the standard .65 The level of effort can vary \ndepending on the future priorities of the Company and the Partners.  This unenforceable promise stands in contrast to some other binding commitments the Company  has proposed.\n66 The merger \nagreement  and term sheet do not contain any enforceable language to back up the rhetoric used \nby the Company and the Partners in their application.  The Company and Partners argue that there is no need for them to make an enforceable commitment to achieve the Carbon Free Standard because the s tandard  is already binding law.\n67 \nBut the Carbon Free Standard  contains several mechanisms that could allow the Company to \navoid meeting emissions reductions targets. The s tandard  permits regulated utilities to meet some \nof their compliance obligation by purchasing Renewable Energy Credits (“ RECs ”) rather than \n                                                 \n63See, e.g., Ex.

Accordingly, the Company and \nPartners’ claims that the A cquisition will result in the Company meeting its Carbon Free \nStandard  emissions reduction targets are me rely unenforceable rhetoric, not binding \ncommitments. \nB. The Partners  May Seek Coal Retirements or Abandon Their Commitment to \nClean Energy.  \nWhile the Partners assert that they plan to fund the Company’s planned clean energy \ntransition, there is a risk that after the A cquisition, the Partners’ goals may change in at least two \nways. First, the Partners may ultimately decide to invest less capita l in clean energy than they \ncurrently claim in the application. The Partners have not committed to how much capital they \nwill ultimately provide for clean resources. While Alloy Parent—a newly -created  entity  with \nunknown capital resources—has committed to provide an unspecified amount of equity financing to fund the Company’s 5- year capital plan,\n70 the Partners have not made any \ncommitments as to how much capital will be directed towards clean resources over the next 5 years.\n71 Indeed, the Partners might deci de to sell the Company at any time.

Boswell Unit 3 is currently scheduled to stop burning coal by the end of 2029, and Boswell Unit 4 is planned to stop burning coal by 2035.\n74 Because the Partners will \nhave effective control over the Company after the Acquisition, the Partners could direct the \nCompany to seek Commission approval to postpone retirement of the Bos well coal units  beyond \ntheir currently -scheduled closure dates .75 The Partners have not committed that they will not \nseek to change the Company’s planned coal retirement dates after the Acquisition, nor does the Acquisition agreement contain any such guarantee.\n76 \nThe Company asserts that there is no cause for concern about potential changes to the \nBoswell coal retirement dates because the Commission ordered the current dates, and any \nchanges to those dates would require Commission approval , via an IRP process  or otherwise.77 \nBut the Company’s own resource planning and investment choices impact the feasibility of meeting the currently scheduled retirement dates.\n78 In its IRP, Minnesota Power proposes \n                                                 \n72 Ex.

The Company could drag its feet \nin developing replacement resources for Boswell, and then choose to seek Commission approval to postpone the Boswell retirement dates after the Acquisition is approved, or the Company \ncould work vigorously to ensure it has resources in place to c omply with the current retirement \ndates.\n80 A commitment by the Company not to seek to postpone the Boswell coal retirement \ndates would have meaningful value, and the Commission’s oversight authority does not excuse the Partners’ refusal to make that commitment.  \nThe Company also suggests that the Carbon Free Standard should assuage any concerns \nthat the Partners might stray from their stated commitment to a clean energy transition.\n81 But the \nCarbon Free Standard does not fully alleviate this risk: If the Partn ers later decline to provide \nsufficient capital to fund the Company’s clean energy transition, the Company and the Commission cannot compel them to provide it.

The Company and Partners argue that the Commission ’s review and \napproval of  any future sale of the Company would mitigate this risk .89 But as Witness Lane \nexplained, Commission review of a sale does not fully mitigate this problem. If the Partners seek to sell the Company because they no longer want to provide capital, and the prospective buyer is not committed to the Company’s clean energy transition, the Commission may be stuck with a choice between two bad options: leave the Company in the hands of an owner that is no longer providing adequate funding, or turn it over to a buyer that may seek to minimize clean energy investments or seek exemptions from the Carbon Free Standard.\n90 \nD. The Company’s Planned “Clean” Transition May Not Actually Be Clean.  \nThe Applicants assert that the A cquisition is needed to access capital specifically to fund \na transition to clean and renewable energy and comply with the Carbon Free Standard.91 \nBut as noted above, the Acquisition agreement does not actually require the Partners to provide any capital , let alone any capital  to support the Company’s clean energy transition, nor does it \nguarantee that the capital the Partners might provide will be used to finance renewable sources.  \n                                                 \n89 Ex.

The record evidence \nbelies the Company’s claims that the Acquisition is driven by clean energy. The Company’s IRP \nproposes far more new natural gas than new renewable energy resources  over the next fifteen \nyears . Specifically, the 2025-2039 IRP proposes to add over 1,000 MW of new natural gas \ncapacity, while only proposing 400 MW of new wind, 100 MW of new battery storage, and no new ut ility-scale solar beyond the resources in its 2021 IRP.\n92 The IRP proposes converting \nBoswell Unit 3 to natural gas by the end of 2029 and considers two refueling options for Boswell Unit 4: a 40 percent methane gas refuel by 2030 or cofiring with biomass a nd natural gas by \n2035.\n93 Thus, in addition to the new gas included in the Company’s 5- year capital plan,94 the IRP \nsuggests that a large portion of the Company’s capital spending over the next decade will be on natural gas . The discrepancy between the clean energy -focused rhetoric the Company uses to \njustify the proposed Acquisition and the Company’s actual gas-heavy resource plans is troubling. \nThe Partners do not guarantee how much of their capital will go towards clean resources  \nover the next fifteen  years . If the Company and Partners over-invest in gas generation in the \nshort term, that may jeopardize the Company’s clean energy transition . In short, the Company \nand Partners fail to provide any concrete commitments to subst antiate the premise that the \nAcquisition would primarily support the Company’s clean energy transition. \n                                                 \n92 Minnesota Power  2025-2039 Integrated Res.

Private E quity Investors S eek H igher R eturns T han the P ublic S tock Market.  \nPrivate equity investors typically seek higher returns than the returns  available via the \npublic stock market, as several witnesses in this case have noted.127 The Partners are seeking to \nacqu ire ALLETE because they believe they can achieve a higher return by taking the Company \nprivate than they could obtain by purchasing ALLETE stock on the public market. Otherwise, the Partners would simply  buy ALLETE stock . The Partners acknowledge that t hey are pursuing  the \nAcquisition  in order to maximize their return on investment.\n128 One way the Partners may seek to \nincrease returns is by pressuring the Company to aggressively seek Commission approval for larger increases in ROE.\n129 This would ultimately result in higher costs for ratepayers.  \nCUB Witness Jester highlighted how a private investment firm’s acquisition of a public \nutility can result in rate increases for customers. He described the 2014 acquisition of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula Power Company (“UPPCO”)  by Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners . \nFollowing that acquisition, UPPCO requested a large ROE increase from the Michigan Public Service Commission and sought to recover substantial cost increases in rate cases.\n130 \n                                                 \n127 Ex.

Partn ers Are Likely to Pressure the Company to  Grow Rate Base to Maximize \nReturn on T heir I nvestment.  \n The Partners will also likely seek to maximize their returns  by pushing the Company to \nmaximize rate base growth .131 In general, regulated utilities often exhib it a bias toward capital \nspending over less capital- intensive alternatives , due to the greater opportunity to earn a \nreturn.132 The Acquisition would exacerbate this existing bias. Witness Lane explained that after \nthe A cquisition , the Partners  may  increase pressure on the Company to prioritize capital \nexpenditures like self -built generation, while under- utilizing potentially lower -cost options like \npower purchase agreements (“PPAs”), demand response, and energy efficiency.133 Witness \nWalters also exp ressed concerns about over- investment after the A cquisition ,134 and Witnesses \nLebens and Addonizio highlighted the potential for the Company to reduce costs via use of \nPPAs.135 The Acquisition will likely increase incentives for the Company to pursue more capital -\nintensive investments , even when they are not the most cost- effective options.  \nThe Company and the Partners dispute that Minnesota Power could use more PPAs to \nreduce capital needs, claiming that PPAs are often more costly than self -built generation.136 \nHowever, the Company and Partner witnesses do not provide any meaningful analysis to support this assertion.  Witness Bram points to increasing prices for wind and solar PPAs.\n137 But he fails \nto compare the PPA prices to the levelized cost of energy of self -built resources.138 While PPA \n                                                 \n131 See Tr.

For example, these \nsubjective factors can include the Company’s judgments about the experience level of the bidders.

If the Acquisition is approved, financial \ndisclosures about Alloy Parent would be insufficient to conduct robust oversight : the \nCommission and stakeholders need information about the Company’s ultimate parents, GIP and \nCPP.179 \nCONCLUSION  \nThe evidence in this proceeding shows that the Acquisition is likely to result in numerous \npotential harms , costs, and risks fo r Minnesota Power ratepayers . The Partners would have an \nincentive to push for over- spending in order to maximize their returns, which will ultimately \nresult in larger rate increases. The A cquisition may also delay Minnesota Power’s  \nretirement of the Bosw ell coal units and the Company’s transition to renewable energy, \nimperiling compliance with the Carbon Free Standard . The Acquisition would also reduce local \ncontrol, as the ALLETE board would be dominated by the Partners, and undermine transparency, as the Partners would not provide financial disclosures comparable to those made by ALLETE. \nALLETE and the Partners have not demonstrated that the Acquisition would provide \nratepayer benefits sufficient to outweigh the se substantial harms and risks.
