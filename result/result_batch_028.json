Brama , Legal Counsel  \nAllete/Minnesota Power  \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board  \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners/Black Rock  \n \nDear Ms. Brama : \n \nPlease accept this new (March 26, 2026) message as notiﬁcation that Commission Staff will be \nasking the following  amended  questions at the upcoming evidentiary hearings related to MPUC \nDocket No. E-015/PA- 24-198  (OAH Docket No. 25-2500 -40339 ). \n \nQuestions we intend to ask are:  \n1. Would Mr. Quackenbush  be willing to ﬁle into e -Dockets the 2024 10K  he references on \npage 3 of his March 4, 2025 Rebuttal Testimony ? \n2. Please reconcile the capital needs described in testimony in this proceeding with the \ncapital needs as  described in the 10K ﬁling mentioned above , and  with  the capital needs \nthat will be required as described in  the Company’s recently ﬁled Integrated Resource Plan \n(IRP)  in MPUC Docket No. E -015/RP -25-127 . \n3. How did the proposed transaction inﬂuence the planning of the IRP mentioned above?  \n4. For any regulated utility where, independently or collectively, either the Canada Pension \nPlan Investment Board and/or Global Infrastructure Partners/Black Rock currently has an ownership interest of 40%  or more , please provide those utility’s capital structure before \nclosing and its most current capital structure.  \n5. For any regulated utility where, independently or collectively, either the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and/or Global Infrastructure Partners/Black Rock previously had, but \nno longer has, an ownership interest of 40% or more, please provide those utility’s capital \nstructure before closing and its capital structure at the time of divesture.  \nSo that these questions can be directed to the appropriate Company witnesses, Commission Staff requests that, at Friday’s conference call with the ALJ, the Company provide the information \nregarding which witnesses will be able to address these questions.  \nThank you.  \nSincerely,  \nRobert Manning"

PAUL, MINNESOTA 55101 \n \nMINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION \nSUITE 350 \n121 SEVENTH PLACE EAST  \nST. PAUL, MINNESOTA 55101-2147 \n \nKatie Sieben  \nJoseph Sullivan \nHwikwon Ham  \nAudrey Partridge  \nJohn Tuma  Chair  \nVice Chair  \nCommissioner  \nCommissioner  \nCommissioner  \n \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota \nPower for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners  OAH File No. 25-2500 -40339  \n \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \n \nMINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF \nCOMMERCE’S MEMORANDUM IN \nSUPPORT OF THE RESIDENTIAL \nUTILITIES DIVISION’S MOTION TO \nLIFT TRADE SECRET \nDESIGNATIONS  \n  The Administrative Law Judge should grant the Office of the Attorney General —\nResidential Utilities Division’s motion to compel  ALLETE to lift its designation of certain \ndocuments as “trade secret” under the Protective Order.  ALLETE has failed to establish  a \nprotectable competitive or other economic interest in the documents in question, which is \nnecessary for data to be properly designated as trade secret .  Absent proof of such an interest, those \ndocuments do not qualify for treatment as trade secrets.  The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, which forms the basis for the Protective \nOrder’s protection of trade secret information, requires broad public access to data in the government’s possession.  Under the MGDPA, all government data collected by government \n2 \n entity1 must be made available to the public unless that data falls within one of the MGDPA’s \nexclusions.2  The Act contains an exclusion, adopted by the Protective Order, which protects from \npublic disclosure information constituting “ trade secrets, ” defined to mean: \n[G]overnment data, including a formula, pattern, compilation, \nprogram, device, method, technique or process (1) that was supplied by the affected individual or organization, (2) that is the subject of efforts by the individual or organization that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy, and (3) that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.\n3 \nTypically, designation of data as trade secret is to  protect  the party producing the data from \nsuffering some competitive harm.   \n The Protective Order authorizes a party to request the redesignation of any materials \nincorrectly designated by the producing party as protected data, including trade secret information.\n4  The trade secret designation does not apply to the data that are the subject of this \nmotion because ALLETE has failed to show, or even attempt to show, that the data derives independent economic value as a result of the data not being ascertainable by others.  The data in question concern ALLETE’s  projected revenues to be collected from ratepayers .  There is clearly \na significant public interest regarding t his is information .  The ALJ has scheduled a number of \npublic hearings to allow members of the public an opportunity to ask questions and express their views on the proposed transaction.\n5  If the ALJ allow s ALLETE to continue to shield its rate \n \n1 The data in question was provided government entities – RUD and the Department – subject to \na trade secret designation and, therefore, qualify as “government data.”  See Minn. Stat. §13.02, \nsubd. 7 (2024). \n2 See Minn. Stat. §13.03, subd. 1 (2024). \n3 Minn. Stat. §13.37, subd. 1(b) (2024); Protective Order ¶1. \n4 Protective Order ¶12. \n5 See Minn. Rules, part 1400.6200, subp. 5 (public participation in contested case proceedings). \n3 \n projections from the public, Minnesota Power’s ratepayers will be prevented from considering or \ncommenting on this information.  Such a result would be obviously prejudicial and contrary to the \nCommission’s desire to develop a complete record.    In support of its trade secret claim, ALLETE offered  no facts and no reasoning beyond \nparroting the trade secret definition.  Simply repeating the legal test does nothing to show how that test has been met.  Further, even if ALLETE had provided a substantive justification for its trade \nsecret claim, as the RUD has correctly pointed out, such an attempted justification could not, in light of the realities of the lack of retail competition to provide electricity, withstand even modest scrutiny.  Even if ALLETE had shown some limited economic benefit to be had from the ongoing \ntrade secret treatment of the data, the trade secret designation must be strictly limited to only that data that ALLETE can demonstrate meets the test.    \n4 \n CONCLUSION \n The Department of Commerce joins the RUD’s request that the ALJ require ALLETE to \nwithdraw its trade secret designation of documents produced in response to Sierra Club IR  No. 26 \nand its  response to OAG IR No. 42 and provide unredacted public versions of those responses. \n \nDated:  March 25, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \n \nKEITH ELLISON  \nState of Minnesota \nAttorney General  \n \n \n s/ Greg Merz  \nRICHARD DORNFELD  \nAssistant Attorney General Atty.

INTRODUCTION. 1 \nQ. Did you provide direct testimony in this proceeding?  2 \nA. Yes.  My direct testimony included a high-level overview of the private equity industry.  I 3 \nalso explained some potential benefits of the proposed acquisition of ALLETE by Global 4 \nInfrastructure Partners (GIP) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) 5 \n(collectively “the Partners” and, together with ALLETE, “the Petitioners” ).  Additionally, 6 \nI explained three categories of potential harms: abuse of  control of the board of directors, 7 \nallocating needed capital away from Minnesota Power, and overallocating capital to rate 8 \nbase.1  I also identified several ways that ALLETE could mitigate its need to raise capital.  9 \nI concluded that the proposed acquisition holds risks, uncertainties, and potential benefits 10 \nfor Minnesota Power and its ratepayers.2  I requested that, in their rebuttal testimony, 11 \nALLETE and the Partners propose conditions that would mitigate the potential harms and 12 \nhelp ensure that the potential benefits of the proposed transaction materialize if it is 13 \napproved. 14 \nQ. What is the purpose of your surrebuttal testimony?  15 \nA. The purpose of my surrebuttal testimony is to respond to the rebuttal testimony of several 16 \nALLETE, GIP, and CPP witnesses.  In Section II, I explain that the Petitioners’ additional 17 \nproposed conditions fall short of my request.  In Section III, I reiterate that ALLETE’s need 18 \nto raise capital could be mitigated.  In Section III.A, I explain that common equity shares 19 \ndo not carry long- term dividend obligations, and that reinvesting earnings mitigates the 20 \n \n1 Rate base is the total value of the property a utility uses to provide service (such as power lines)  \nand on which the utility is allowed to earn a specified rate of return . \n2 Lebens Direct at 26:3 –4. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n2 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal need to raise capital .  Finally, in Section III.B, I explain that power purchase agreements 1 \n(PPAs) should be used to the extent they are consistent with the public interest.   2 \nII. THE  PETITIONERS’ PROPOSED CONDITIONS DO NOT MITIGATE THE 3 \nRISKS OF THE ACQUISITION OR ENSURE THAT TANGIBLE BENEFITS 4 \nWILL MATERIALIZE.  5 \nQ. Have the Petitioners   proposed additional conditions in their rebuttal testimony?  6 \nA. Yes.  In addition to making several commitments in their original petition, the Petitioners 7 \nhave proposed new conditions in rebuttal testimony in a further effort to gain approval of 8 \ntheir proposed acquisition.  Witnesses for ALLETE, GIP, and CPP explain various 9 \nproposed conditions, and ALLETE witness Cady summarizes the currently proposed 10 \nconditions.3   11 \nQ. Why are ALLETE, GIP, and CPP proposing additional conditions? 12 \nA. Witness  Cady concludes her explanation of the conditions by saying that “these 13 \ncommitments are evidence of both the Company and the Partners wanting to take 14 \nmeaningful action to address stakeholder concerns and ultimately make this Acquisition 15 \nbetter.”4 16 \nQ. What types of conditions were proposed in rebuttal testimony?  17 \nA. Witness  Cady’s rebuttal schedule consists of the following two broad categories: 18 \n“Commitments Specific To The Acquisition” and “Additional Affirmations Of The 19 \nRegulatory Compact.”  Those two categories are further divided into the following 20 \nsubcategories:  21 \n1. Affiliated Interests  22 \n2. Books and Records 23 \n3. Capital Structure (Equity and Debt) 24 \n \n3 Cady Rebuttal at 21–28 and JCC Rebuttal Schedule 1. \n4 Cady Rebuttal at 28:7–10. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n3 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal 4. Core Values and Environmental Commitments  1 \n5. Corporate Separateness/ Ring Fencing  2 \n6. Financial Commitments to Minnesota Power 3 \n7. Governance  4 \n8. Ratemaking and Affordability 5 \n9. Workforce and Labor Protections 6 \nQ. Do those commitments fulfill the request you made in direct testimony?  7 \nA. No.  I requested  conditions that would (1) help mitigate rate increases, (2) optimize capital 8 \nallocation, and (3) mitigate the risk that board control could be abused.  The Petitioners’ 9 \nproposed conditions do not meaningfully address those request s.   10 \nQ. Would you discuss the extent to which the Petitioners proposed conditions related to 11 \nrate-increase mitigation? 12 \nA. Yes.  ALLETE witness Cady’s Rebuttal Schedule 1 summarizes eleven conditions related 13 \nto “Ratemaking and Affordability” that mitigate rate increases to some extent, but none of 14 \nwhich provide any assurances regarding the frequency or total size of future rate increases.   15 \nQ. Would you discuss the extent to which the Petitioners proposed conditions related to 16 \noptimizing capital allocation? 17 \nA. Yes.  The Petitioners have proposed a condition to partially mitigate the risk that the 18 \nPartners could decide to reallocate needed capital away from Minnesota Power, by 19 \ncommitting that Alloy Parent will fund Minnesota Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan, 20 \nbut they do not address the risk that the Partners could over -allocate unneeded capital to 21 \nMinnesota Power, thereby increasing rates.  22 \nQ. Would you discuss the extent to which the Petitioners proposed conditions related to 23 \nmitigating the risk that board control could be abused?  24 \nA. Yes.  The Petitioners offer four governance -related commitments.  The commitments 25 \nlargely focus on where some of the board members are from (Minnesota and Wisconsin) 26 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n4 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal and who has the right to select the members, rather than ensuring that those members 1 \nselected do not have conflicts of interest or raise other risks that board control could be 2 \nabused.   3 \nQ. Overall, do the additional conditions that Petitioners proposed in rebuttal testimony 4 \naddress the concerns you raised  about ALLETE being acquired by the Partners?   5 \nA. Only partially .  The risk of Partners reallocating capital away from Minnesota Power is 6 \nsomewhat mitigated by the Petitioners’ commitment that Alloy Parent will provide the 7 \ncapital “required to fund Minnesota Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan reflected in its 8 \nFebruary 2025 10- K filing, subject to prospective reasonable and prudent plan 9 \nadjustments.”5  But, “Minnesota Power ’s 5-year capital investment plan”6 is not well 10 \ndefined in the February 2025 10- K filing  that they reference.7  Moreover, the commitment 11 \nonly lasts for five years and is made on behalf of Alloy Parent, not the Partners.  For these 12 \nreasons, the strength of the capital commitment being offered is unclear.  13 \nQ. Are there any other reasons that Petitioners’ commitments are inadequate?  14 \nA.  Yes.  The lack of a commitment to mitigate rate increases is concerning considering the 15 \nrate impacts that ALLETE has forecasted .   16 \nIn response to a Sierra Club information request, ALLETE produced a spreadsheet 17 \nshowing “the estimated revenue requirements that are anticipated to be collected from 18 \nMinnesota Power customers .”8   This spreadsheet assumes that Minnesota Power will 19 \nincrease rates by  appr oximately [TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS]   20 \n \n5 Cady Rebuttal, Schedule 1. \n6 Id. \n7 See ALLETE, Inc., Annual Report (Form 10- K) (Feb. 13, 2025), \nhttps://investor.allete.com/node/22956/html .   \n8 ALLETE Response to Sierra Club IR 26, included in Schedule BP L-S-1. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n5 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal  [TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS]  ove r 2023 to 2032, or a cumulative  1 \nincrease of  [T RADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS]   [TRADE 2 \nSECRET INFORMATION ENDS] .9  For the residential class, ALLETE’s  spreadsheet 3 \nassumes an increase of  approximately [TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS]  4 \n[TRADE SECRET INFORMATION ENDS ] or  a compound annual 5 \ngrowth rate of [TRADE SECRET INFORMATION BEGINS]   [T RADE 6 \nSECRET INFORMATION ENDS ] over this period.10 7 \nALLETE asserts that “Minnesota Power is not assuming that it will increase rates 8 \nby any particular amount over the 2023- 2032 time period.”11  But it also admits that it 9 \nprovided the projections to “the Partners and ALLETE financial advisors in connection 10 \nwith the process leading to the execution of the Merger Agreement.”12  The lack of a 11 \ncommitment to mitigate rate increases makes it more likely that the significant rate 12 \nincreases that ALLETE projected in response to Sierra Club’s information request  26, will 13 \ncome to pass.  14 \nIII. THE PETITIONERS’ REBUTTAL TESTIMONY SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE 15 \nNOT INTERESTED IN MITIGATING ALLETE’S CAPITAL NEEDS.   16 \nQ. Did you address ALLETE’s claimed capital need in your direct testimony?  17 \nA. Yes.  ALLETE says it needs approximately $20 billion over approximately 20 years, the 18 \nvast majority of which is being driven by Minnesota Power.  Investing capital is one of the 19 \nprimary ways that utilities and their shareholders generate profit.  Customers benefit when 20 \nutilities invest enough to provide adequate, reliable service.  I nvesting more than necessary 21 \n \n9 See ALLETE Response to Sierra Club IR 26, 26.02 Attach, included in Schedule BPL -S-1. \n10 See id.  \n11 ALLETE Response to OAG IR 42, included in Schedule BPL -S-2. \n12 ALLETE Response to Sierra Club IR 26. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n6 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal to provide adequate , reliable  service can be financially problematic for customers because 1 \nunnecessary expenditures can cause unnecessary rate increases.   In direct testimony I listed 2 \nsix ways that ALLETE could mitigate its capital needs: 3 \n1. Using power purchase agreements (PPAs) to procure power from third parties; 4 \n2. Allowing customers the freedom to more easily produce their own energy; 5 \n3. Selling non- core assets to raise cash;  6 \n4. Raising equity in the public markets from investors including BlackRock, CPP, 7 \nand CalPERS, who also invest in publicly traded companies; 8 \n5. Slowing dividend growth and using the retained earnings to help fund 9 \ninvestments; and  10 \n6. Encouraging customers to participate in load -flexibility program s.13 11 \nI note that number four above should not have been included in this l ist because it 12 \ndoes not mitigate capital needs  but rather may provide a relatively easy source of capital .   13 \nQ. How would you characterize Petitioners’ response?  14 \nA. Overall, ALLETE, GIP, and CPP do not seem interested in mitigating ALLETE’s capital 15 \nneeds for customers’ benefit.  For example, ALLETE witness Taran focuses on investors 16 \nrather than customers, stating, “Witness Lebens’ solutions, when taken together, could 17 \nhave a material adverse impact on investor interest in ALLETE.  For example, the proposal 18 \nto pursue more PPAs would limit earnings growth prospects for the Company’s current 19 \nand prospective investors in the public markets.”14  It is my understanding that the question 20 \nbefore the Commission focuses on the broader public interest and is  not limited to 21 \nconsidering the subset of investor interests.  I also note that I raised the possibility of (1) 22 \nallow ing customers the freedom to more easily produce their own electricity behind the 23 \nmeter  and (2) increas ing the amount of flexible customer load on the electric grid , but the 24 \nPetitioners did not meaningfully address these possibilities .   25 \n \n13 Lebens Direct  at 24–25. \n14 Taran Rebuttal at 23:19–22. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n7 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal Q. Are there particular arguments you want to address in more detail? 1 \nA. Yes, there are two.  First, ALLETE appears to believe that it cannot  slow dividend growth, 2 \nin part because it has “dividend obligations” to shareholders.  Second, certain Petitioner 3 \nwitnesses mischaracterize my testimony by suggesting that my recommendation is for 4 \nMinnesota Power to obtain all  its electricity needs from PPAs.  I respond in greater detail 5 \nbelow. 6 \nA. P ETITIONERS FAIL TO REBUT MY TESTIMONY THAT SLOWING DIVIDEND 7 \nGROWTH CAN MITIGATE CAPITAL NEEDS . 8 \nQ. Does ALLETE agree with you that slowing dividend growth can mitigate capital 9 \nneeds?  10 \nA. ALLETE witnesses Scissons and Taran both respond to my testimony regarding dividends.  11 \nThey do not seem to dispute that slowing dividend growth can help mitigate the need to 12 \nraise external capital.  But, they suggest that reducing dividend levels is not feasible in part 13 \nbecause ALLETE has “significant future dividend obligations” to shareholders.15 14 \nQ. Do common- equity shares carry dividend obligations?  15 \nA. Not over the long term.  A company is only obligated to pay a dividend that its board has 16 \nalready officially declared.  Dividend- paying companies often declare a dividend several 17 \nweeks  in advance; in doing so, the company essentially creates a short-term obligation for 18 \nitself to pay a dividend to common shareholders in the future.  Companies do not generally 19 \ndeclare dividends more than 90 days in advance .  Therefore, it is not accurate to suggest, 20 \nas Scissons and Taran do, that ALLETE has “significant future dividend obligations”16 in 21 \nthe long term. 22 \n \n15 Scissons Rebuttal at 16:24; Taran Rebuttal at 18:22. \n16 Scissons Rebuttal at 16. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n8 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal Q. What else does ALLETE argue with respect to dividends?  1 \nA. Witness Taran claims that “the overwhelming reaction of the public equity market to 2 \ndividend cuts is to punish the stock price of the utility cutting its dividend.”17  The 3 \nsuggestion appears to be that a lower stock price caused by reduced dividends would make 4 \nit more difficult for  the utility to raise equity capital. 5 \nQ. Do you have any response?  6 \nA. Yes.  First, I did not suggest that ALLETE’s dividends should decrease or be “cut.”  I stated 7 \nthat ALLETE could “ slow dividend growth  and use the increased retained earnings to help 8 \nfund the energy transition.”18  I also noted that Xcel Energy, Inc. is one utility that has 9 \nbegun slowing its rate of dividend growth in order to reinvest.19  Second, the Partners  10 \nthemselves appear to be planning to cut ALLETE’s dividends ,20 yet they are still willing 11 \nto pay a premium for ALLETE’s stock.    12 \nQ. Would ALLETE’s access to capital remain reasonable as a public ly traded  company 13 \neven if the company’s share price declines?   14 \nA. Yes.  Current shareholders would likely prefer a higher share price at which to sell, but 15 \npotential new shareholders, who would provide the new capital, would likely prefer a lower 16 \nshare price at which to buy.   17 \n \n17 Taran Rebuttal at 10:19–20. \n18 Lebens Direct at 25 (emphasis added). \n19 Id. \n20 Bram Rebuttal at 38:12–13 ( mentioning “the Partners’ approach of forgoing dividends to \nreinvest in the utility to provide longer term growth and value” ). \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n9 \nD\nocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal Q. Are there any utility -owning holding companies that do not pay dividends?  1 \nA. Yes.  Berkshire Hathaway does not pay dividends and owns several large utility companies, 2 \nincluding PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy, NV Energy, and Northern Natural Gas.21  3 \nBerkshire previously paid a dividend in 1967, and Warren Buffet recently explained that 4 \n“[f]or sixty years, Berkshire shareholders endorsed continuous reinvestment and that 5 \nenabled the company to build its taxable income.”22    6 \nB. CUSTOMERS ’ BEST INTEREST SHOULD GUIDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH 7 \nMINNESOTA POWER RELIES ON POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS . 8 \nQ. W\nhich Petitioner witnesses discuss PPAs?  9 \nA. ALLETE witnesses Scissons  and Taran, GIP witness Bram, and consultant Quackenbush 10 \ndiscuss their concerns with PPAs.  They generally conclude that PPAs are not a panacea 11 \nfor ALLETE’s capital needs.  12 \nQ. Can you provide more detail on what these witnesses said ? 13 \nA. Yes.  Witness Scissons says that PPAs “are not always the most cost -effective option”23 14 \nand that “relying almost exclusively on PPAs, or even just relying too heavily on PPAs . . . 15 \nwould put all the financial bargaining power in the hands of developers, rather than the 16 \nCompany to find the best cost structures for customers and would have other negative 17 \nfinancial impacts to the Company’s cost of capital.”24 18 \nWitness Taran states, among other things, that “[s]olely pursuing PPAs instead of 19 \nbidding self -build projects inaccurately presumes that PPAs will be the lowest cost and 20 \n21 See Investing in Energy , Berkshire Hathaway , https://www.brkenergy.com/energy (last visited \nMar. 22, 2025).  \n22 Letter from Warren Buffet to  the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway at 6 (Feb. 22, 2025) , \nhttps://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf , attached as BPL -S -3. \n23 Scissons Rebuttal at 11. \n24 Scissons Rebuttal at 15:10–14. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n10 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal therefore financially preferable projects to pursue”25 and that “Minnesota Power will only 1 \nself-develop projects that are chosen to be the least cost and highest value to customers.”26   2 \nGIP witness Bram states that “PPAs do have a place in a utility’s portfolio, but 3 \nexcessive reliance on PPAs can increase costs for the utility and its customers.”27 4 \n Finally, witness Quackenbush states that “PPAs sometimes are not cost -effective 5 \nfor customers,” that “[c]ase-by- case analysis will reveal which PPAs are economical,” and 6 \nthat the Commission has tended to “approve a mix of PPAs and utility-owned projects for 7 \nMinnesota Power based on which will result in the most cost- effective set of resources for 8 \ncustomers.”28 9 \nQ. How do you respond? 10 \nA. I agree that PPAs are not a panacea; they carry a variety of pros and cons  that can vary 11 \namong utilities and over time .   12 \nQ. Did your direct testimony suggest that Minnesota Power should exclusively rely on 13 \nPPAs?  14 \nA. No, I did not suggest that Minnesota P ower  should pursue a “PPA-only”29 strategy or that 15 \nMinnesota Power should be “solely pursuing PPAs,”30 as these witnesses seem to believe.  16 \nInstead, I simply stated that PPAs could be one of several ways that ALLETE could 17 \nmitigate its capital need.31 ALLETE should not blindly “meet all of its Carbon Free 18 \n \n25 Taran Rebuttal at 16:8 –11. \n26 Taran Rebuttal at 16:19–20. \n27 Bram Rebuttal at 17:24 –25. \n28 Quackenbush Rebuttal at 5:19–24. \n29 Taran Rebuttal at 16:8 –11. \n30 Taran Rebuttal at 16:8 –11. \n31 Lebens Direct at 24:12–18. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\n \n11 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nLebens Surrebuttal Standard obligations through power purchase agreements.”32  Instead, the mix between 1 \nPPAs and company- owned assets should be optimized based on customers’ best interest, 2 \nas consultant Quackenbush and CPP witness Alley seem to agree.33,34   3 \nQ.   Does these witnesses’ testimony change your view that ALLETE’s capital need could 4 \nbe mitigated through PPAs or the other means you listed in direct testimony?   5 \nA. No.  Neither PPAs nor the other capital -mitigation measures I identified can be the sole 6 \nsolution to helping ALLETE fund the energy transition, but they can all play a part.  And 7 \nit is likely that ALLETE’s capital needs will need to be significantly mitigated to avoid 8 \nunaffordable rate impacts such as those projected in ALLETE’s response to the Sierra Club 9 \nIR discussed above.35  10 \nIV. CONCLUSION.  11 \nQ. What do you conclude? 12 \nA. The Petitioners partially address one of the concerns that I listed in direct testimony.  That 13 \nis, they partially address the concern about potential under- investment in ALLETE but fail 14 \nto fully resolve the remainder of my concerns, including my concerns about over - 15 \ninvestment in ALLETE and the resulting rate impacts.   To recap:  16 \n1. The Petitioners have failed to make commitments as to the frequency and amount of 17 \nrate increases , including base rates and riders .

The spreadsheet assumed increases proportional to each class’s base revenue as a high -\nlevel modeling assumption. This does not constitute the Company’s plan for future filing s \nor expectation of future revenue apportionment, which will be determined by the \nCommission in future rate proceedings.  \n \n4. The Company does not expect the assumptions in the spreadsheet to be “accurate” over this time period. As discussed above, this is a high-level modeling exercise of potential \nrevenue requirements based on a set of assumptions at a point in time. The actual  level of \nrequired revenue will change based on a multitude of factors over this time period, which the Company cannot speculate on. Mathematically, the  spreadsheet  [TRADE SECRET \nINFORMATION BEGINS   \n TRADE SECRET INF O\n RMATION ENDS]  but Minnesota Power does \nnot anticipate any particular level of residential rate increases over the 2023 -2032 period \nnor does it expect any individual rate changes (which typically do not happen on an annual \nbasis) to be the same for each rate proceeding.  \n \nB. \n1. Minnesota Power is not assuming that it will increase rates by any particular amount over \nthe 2023-2032 time period . As discussed above, this is a high-level modeling exercise of \npotential revenue requirements based on a set of assumptions at a point in time.  Any future \nrate changes will remain fully subject to Commission approval.  \n \n2. This is based on the level of revenue increases that would be required to meet the revenue requirements from the forward-looking assumptions in CUB IR 0077.01 Attach TS.  \n \n3. Due to the high-level nature of the forecast, the Company does not have an accurate \nbreakout of future amounts by recovery method. As described in subpart B.2, this is a high-\nlevel forecast of the future revenue requirements.  The model did not contemplate  specific \ntiming of rate case or cost recovery rider fillings with any level of specificity.  \n \n4. The amounts in the spreadsheet are inclusive of all revenue requirements.  \n \n5. See subpart B.4. For the reasons noted throughout this response, the capital costs were simply based on the authorized ROE and capital structure in place at the time of \npreparation.  The embedded cost of debt fluctuated based on assumed debt maturities and \nissuances , ranging from the currently authorized cost of debt of 4.4% to 5.1% over the \nforecast period.    \n \n6.

See SIERRA IR 0058 (c). While the A cquisition does not directly impact customer rates, \nif the Acquisition does not close the Company will be in a challenging position and will \nface material risk in accessing the amount of capital needed to serve customers, as well as the potential increases  in costs of capital for customers as compared to the past when the \nCompany did not require the same quantities of capital. This could lead to increased costs in either or both of the cost of capital and the costs of dela ys in projects, as well as the \ninability to execute projects in a timely manner to meet State carbon free goals.  As such, the Acquisition presents rate -related benefits in the form of avoided risk and the potential \nto avoid rate increases that may be required if the Company must rely on the public market to obtain equity financing . Further, maintaining the financial health and capability \nof the Company to access capital through the Acquisition avoids these negative outcomes and allows the Commission (rathe r than the limitations of the public markets as applied to \nALLETE) to determine whether Minnesota Power can move forward with proposed \nprojects and initiatives consistent with S tate policy goals and the public interest. The \nCompany believes keeping this authority in the hands of the Commission is a rate -related \nbenefit to customers.  \nThe information designated as trade secret herein is financial information and is designated as \nsuch because this information is not generally known to and not readily ascertainable by investors and competitors of the Company who could obtain economic value from its \ndisclosure.

As a public company, we \nare required to periodically tell you many specific facts and figures. \n“Report,” however, implies a greater responsibility. In addition to the mandated data, we \nbelieve we owe you additional commentary about what you own and how we think. Our goal is \nto communicate with you in a manner that we would wish you to use if our positions were reversed – that is, if you were Berkshire’s CEO while I and my family were passive investors, \ntrusting you  with our savings. \nThis approach leads us to an annual recitation of both good and bad developments at the \nmany businesses you indirectly own through your Berkshire shares. When discussing problems at specific subsidiaries, we do, however, try to follow the advice Tom Murphy gave to me 60 years ago: “praise by name, criticize by category.” \nMistakes – Yes, We Make Them at Berkshire \nSometimes I’ve made mistakes in assessing the future economics of a business I’ve \npurchased for Berkshire – each a case of capital allocation gone wrong. That happens with both \njudgments about marketable equities – we view these as partial  ownership of businesses – and \nthe 100% acquisitions of companies. \nAt other times, I’ve made mistakes when assessing the abilities or fidelity of the \nmanagers Berkshire is hiring. The fidelity disappointments can hurt beyond their financial impact, a pain that can approach that of a failed marriage. \nA decent batting average in personnel decisions is all that can be hoped for. The cardinal \nsin is delaying the correction of mistakes or what Charlie Munger called “thumb-sucking.” Problems, he would tell me, cannot be wished away. They require action, however uncomfortable that may be. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nDuring the 2019-23 period, I have used the words “mistake” or “error” 16 times in my \nletters to you. Many other huge companies have  never  used either word over that span. Amazon, \nI should acknowledge, made some brutally candid observations in its 2021 letter. Elsewhere, it has generally been happy talk and pictures. \n1 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 1 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nI have also been a director of large public companies at which “mistake” or “wrong” were \nforbidden words at board meetings or analyst calls. That taboo, implying managerial perfection, \nalways made me nervous (though, at times, ther e could be legal issues that make limited \ndiscussion advisable. We live in a very litigious society.) \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAt 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the \nannual letters. Greg shares the Berkshire creed that a “report” is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to owners. And he also understands that if you start fooling your shareholders, you will soon believe your own baloney and be fooling yourself as well. \nPete Liegl – One of a Kind \nLet me pause to tell you the remarkable story of Pete Liegl, a man unknown to most \nBerkshire shareholders but one who contributed many billions to their aggregate wealth. Pete \ndied in November, still working at 80. \nI first heard of Forest River – the Indiana company Pete founded and managed – on \nJune 21, 2005. On that day I received a letter from an  intermediary detailing relevant data about \nthe company, a recreational vehicle (“RV”) manufacturer. The writer said that Pete, the 100% owner of Forest River, specifically wanted to sell to Berkshire. He also told me the price that Pete expected to receive. I liked this no-nonsense approach. \nI did some checking with RV dealers, liked what I learned and arranged a June 28\nth \nmeeting in Omaha. Pete brought along his wife, Sharon, and daughter, Lisa. When we met, Pete \nassured me that he wanted to keep running the business but would feel more comfortable if he could assure financial security for his family. \nPete next mentioned that he owned some real estate that was leased to Forest River and \nhad not been covered in the June 21 letter. Within a few minutes, we arrived at a price for those assets as I expressed no need for appraisal by Berkshire but would simply accept his valuation. \nThen we arrived at the other point that needed clarity. I asked Pete what his compensation \nshould be, adding that whatever he said, I would accept. (This, I should add, is not an approach I \nrecommend for general use.) \nPete paused as his wife, daughter and I leaned forward. Then he surprised us: “Well, I \nlooked at Berkshire’s proxy statement and I wouldn’t want to make more than my boss, so pay me $100,000 per year.” After I picked myself off the floor, Pete added: “But we will earn X (he named a number) this year, and I would like an annual bonus of 10% of any earnings above what the company is now delivering.” I replied: “OK Pete, but if Forest River makes any significant acquisitions we will make an appropriate adjustment for the additional capital thus employed.” I didn’t define “appropriate” or “significant,” but those vague terms never caused a problem. \n2 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 2 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nThe four of us then went to dinner at Omaha’s Happy Hollow Club and lived happily \never after. During the next 19 years, Pete shot the lights out. No competitor came close to his \nperformance. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nEvery company doesn’t have an easy-to-understand business and there are very few \nowners or managers like Pete. And, of course, I expect to make my share of mistakes about the businesses Berkshire buys and sometimes err in evaluating the sort of person with whom I’m dealing. \nBut I’ve also had many pleasant surprises in both the potential of the business as well as \nthe ability and fidelity of the manager. And our experience is that a single  winning decision can \nmake a breathtaking difference over time. (Think GEICO as a business decision, Ajit Jain as a managerial decision and my luck in finding Char lie Munger as a one-of-a-kind partner, personal \nadvisor and steadfast friend.) Mistakes fade away; winners can forever blossom. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nOne further point in our CEO selections: I never look at where a candidate has gone to \nschool. Never! \nOf course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are \nplenty such as Pete who may have benefitted by attending a less prestigious institution or even by not bothering to finish school. Look at my frie nd, Bill Gates, who decided that it was far more \nimportant to get underway in an exploding industry that would change the world than it was to stick around for a parchment that he could hang on the wall. (Read his new book, Source Code.) \nNot long ago, I met – by phone – Jessica Toonkel, whose step-grandfather, Ben Rosner, \nlong ago ran a business for Charlie and me. Ben was a retailing genius and, in preparing for this report, I checked with Jessica to confirm Ben’s schooling, which I remembered as limited. Jessica’s reply: “Ben never went past 6\nth grade.” \nI was lucky enough to get an education at three fine universities. And I avidly believe in \nlifelong learning. I’ve observed, however, that a very large portion of business talent is innate with nature swamping nurture. \nPete Liegl was a natural. \n3 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 3 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nLast Year’s Performance \nIn 2024, Berkshire did better than I expected though 53% of our 189 operating \nbusinesses reported a decline in earnings. We were aided by a predictable large gain in \ninvestment income as Treasury Bill yields impr oved and we substantially increased our holdings \nof these highly-liquid short-term securities. \nOur insurance business also delivered a major increase in earnings, led by the \nperformance of GEICO. In five years, Todd Combs has reshaped GEICO in a major way, increasing efficiency and bringing underwriting practices up to date. GEICO was a long-held gem that needed major repolishing, and Todd has worked tirelessly in getting the job done. Though not yet complete, the 2024 improvement was spectacular. \nIn general, property-casualty (“P/C”) insurance pricing strengthened during 2024, \nreflecting a major increase in damage from convective storms. Climate change may have been announcing its arrival. However, no “monster” event occurred during 2024. Someday, any day, a \ntruly staggering insurance loss will occur – and there is no guarantee that there will be only one per annum. \nThe P/C business is so central to Berkshire that it warrants a further discussion that \nappears later in this letter. \nBerkshire’s railroad and utility operations, our two largest businesses outside of \ninsurance, improved their aggregate earnings. Both, however, have much left to accomplish. \nLate in the year we increased our ownership of the utility operation from about 92% to \n100% at a cost of roughly $3.9 billion, of which $2.9 billion was paid in cash with a balance in Berkshire “B” shares. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAll told, we recorded operating earnings of $47.4 billion in 2024. We regularly – endlessly, \nsome readers may groan – emphasize this measure rather than the GAAP-mandated earnings that \nare reported on page K-68. \nOur measure excludes capital gains or losses on the stocks and bonds we own, whether \nrealized or unrealized. Over time, we think it highly likely that gains will prevail – why else would we buy these securities? – though the year-by-year numbers will swing wildly and unpredictably. Our horizon for such commitments is almost always far longer than a single year. In many, our thinking involves decades. These long-termers are the purchases that sometimes make the cash register ring like church bells. \n4 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 4 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nHere’s a breakdown of the 2023-24 earnings as we see them.

An Important American Record is Smashed \nSixty years ago, present management took control of Berkshire. That move was a \nmistake – my mistake – and one that plagued us for two decades . Charlie, I should emphasize, \nspotted my obvious error immediately: Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked  cheap, its \nbusiness – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction. \nThe U.S. Treasury, of all places, had already received silent warnings of Berkshire’s \ndestiny. In 1965, the company did not pay a dime of income tax, an embarrassment that had generally prevailed at the company for a decade . That sort of economic behavior may be \nunderstandable for glamorous startups, but it’s a blinking yellow light when it happens at a venerable pillar of American industry. Berkshire was headed for the ash can. \nFast forward 60 years and imagine the surprise at the Treasury when that same \ncompany – still operating under the name of Berkshire Hathaway – paid far more in corporate \nincome tax than the U.S. government had ever received from any company – even the American \ntech titans that commanded market values in the trillions . \nTo be precise, Berkshire last year made four payments to the IRS that totaled $26.8 \nbillion. That’s about 5% of what all of corporate America paid. (In addition, we paid sizable \namounts for income taxes to foreign governments and to 44 states.) \n5 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 5 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nNote one crucial factor allowing this record-shattering payment: Berkshire shareholders \nduring the same 1965-2024 period received only one cash dividend. On January 3, 1967, we \ndisbursed our sole payment – $101,755 or 10¢ per A share. (I can’t remember why I suggested this action to Berkshire’s board of directors. Now it seems like a bad dream.) \nFor sixty years , Berkshire shareholders endorsed continuous reinvestment and that \nenabled the company to build its taxable income. Cash income-tax payments to the U.S. Treasury, miniscule in the first decade, now aggregate more than $101  billion . . . and counting. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nHuge numbers can be hard to visualize. Let me recast the $26.8 billion that we paid last \nyear. \nIf Berkshire had sent the Treasury a $1 million check every 20 minutes  throughout all of \n2024 – visualize 366 days and nights because 2024 was a leap year – we still would have owed \nthe federal government a significant sum at yearend. Indeed, it would be well into January before the Treasury would tell us that we could take a short breather, get some sleep, and prepare for our 2025 tax payments. \nWhere Your Money Is \nBerkshire’s equity activity is ambidextrous. In one hand we own control of many \nbusinesses, holding at least 80% of the investee’s shares. Generally, we own 100%. \nThese 189 subsidiaries have similarities to marketable common stocks but are far from identical. The collection is worth many hundreds of billions and includes a few rare gems, many good-but-far-from-fabulous businesses and some laggards that have been disappointments. \nWe own nothing that is a major drag, but we have a number that I should not have purchased. \nIn the other  hand, we own a small percentage of a dozen or so very large and highly \nprofitable businesses with household names such as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Moody’s. Many of these companies earn very high returns on the net tangible equity required for their operations. At yearend, our partial-ownership holdings were valued at $272 billion. Understandably, really outstanding businesses are very seldom offered in their entirety, but small \nfractions of these gems can be purchased Monday through Friday on Wall Street and, very occasionally, they sell at bargain prices. \nWe are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon \nwhere we can best deploy your (and my family’s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very \ninfrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities. Greg has vividly shown his ability to act at such times as did Charlie. \n6 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 6 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nWith marketable equities, it is easier to change course when I make a mistake. \nBerkshire’s present size, it should be underscored, diminishe s this valuable option. We can’t \ncome and go on a dime. Sometimes a year or more is required to establish or divest an \ninvestment. Additionally, with ownership of minority positions we can’t change management if that action is needed or control what is done with capital flows if we are unhappy with the decisions being made. \nWith controlled companies, we can dictate these decisions, but we have far less flexibility \nin the disposition of mistakes. In reality, Berk shire almost never sells controlled businesses \nunless we face what we believe to be unending probl ems. An offset is that some business owners \nseek out Berkshire because of our steadfast behavior. Occasionally, that can be a decided plus for us. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nDespite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at \nBerkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change. While our ownership in marketable  equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to \n$272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far \ngreater than the value of the marketable  portfolio. \nBerkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority \nof their money in equities – mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never  prefer ownership of cash-equivalent \nassets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned. \nPaper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this \nreckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency. \nBusinesses, as well as individuals with desi red talents, however, will usually find a way \nto cope with monetary instability as long as their goods or services are desired by the country’s citizenry. So, too, with personal skills. Lacking such assets as athletic excellence, a wonderful voice, medical or legal skills or, for that matter, any special talents, I have had to rely on equities \nthroughout my life. In effect, I have depended on the success of American businesses and I will continue to do so. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nOne way or another, the sensible – better yet imaginative – deployment of savings by \ncitizens is required to propel an ever-growing societal output of desired goods and services. This system is called capitalism. It has its faults and abuses – in certain respects more egregious now than ever – but it also can work wonders unmatched by other economic systems. \nAmerica is Exhibit A. Our country’s progress over its mere 235 years of existence could \nnot have been imagined by even the most optimistic colonists in 1789, when the Constitution was adopted and the country’s energies were unleashed. \n7 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 7 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nTrue, our country in its infancy sometimes borrowed abroad to supplement our own \nsavings. But, concurrently, we needed many Americans to consistently save and then needed \nthose savers or other Americans to wisely deploy the capital thus made available. If America had consumed all that it produced, the country would have been spinning its wheels. \nThe American process has not always been pretty – our country has forever had many \nscoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with their savings. But even with such malfeasance – which remains in full force today – and also much deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or disruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output beyond the dreams of any colonist. \nFrom a base of only four million people – and despite a brutal internal war early on, \npitting one American against another – America changed the world in the blink of a celestial eye. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nIn a very  minor way, Berkshire shareholders have participated in the American miracle by \nforegoing dividends, thereby electing to reinvest rather than consume. Originally, this reinvestment was tiny, almost meaningless, but  over time, it mushroomed, reflecting the mixture \nof a sustained culture of savings, combined with the magic of long-term compounding. \nBerkshire’s activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished. \nCompanies die for many reasons but, unlike the fate of humans, old age itself is not lethal. Berkshire today is far more youthful than it was in 1965. \nHowever , as Charlie and I have always acknowledged, Berkshire would not have \nachieved its results in any locale except America whereas America would have been every bit the success it has been if Berkshire had never existed. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nSo thank you, Uncle Sam. Someday your nieces and nephews at Berkshire hope to send \nyou even larger payments than we did in 2024. Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires  both wisdom and vigilance on \nyour part. \nProperty-Casualty Insurance \nP/C insurance continues to be Berkshire’s core business. The industry follows a financial \nmodel that is rare – very rare – among giant businesses. \nCustomarily, companies incur costs for labor, materials, inventories, plant and equipment, \netc. before  – or concurrently with – the sale of their products or services. Consequently, their \nCEOs have a good fix on knowing the cost of their product before  they sell it. If the selling price \nis less than its cost, managers soon learn they have a problem. Hemorrhaging cash is hard to \nignore. \n8 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 8 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nWhen writing P/C insurance, we receive payment upfront and much later  learn what our \nproduct has cost us – sometimes a moment of truth that is delayed as much as 30 or more years. \n(We are still making substantial payments on asbest os exposures that occurred 50 or more years \nago.) \nThis mode of operations has the desirable effect of giving P/C insurers cash before \nthey incur most expenses but carries with it the risk that the company can be losing money – sometimes mountains of money – before the CEO and directors realize what is happening. \nCertain lines of insurance minimize this mismatch, such as crop insurance or hail damage \nin which losses are quickly reported, evaluated and paid. Other lines, however, can lead to executive and shareholder bliss as the company is going broke. Think coverages such as medical malpractice or product liability. In “long-tail” lines, a P/C insurer may report large but fictitious profits to its owners and regulators for many years – even decades. The accounting can be particularly dangerous if the CEO is an optimist or a crook. These possibilities are not fanciful: \nHistory reveals a large number of each species. \nIn recent decades, this “money-up-front, loss-payments-later” model has allowed \nBerkshire to invest large sums (“float”) while ge nerally delivering what we believe to be a small \nunderwriting profit. We make estimates for “surprises” and, so far, these estimates have been sufficient. \nWe are not deterred by the dramatic and growing loss payments sustained by our \nactivities. (As I write this, think wildfires.) It’s our job to price to absorb these and unemotionally take our lumps when surprises develop. It’s also our job to contest “runaway” verdicts, spurious \nlitigation and outright fraudulent behavior. \nUnder Ajit, our insurance operation has blossomed from an obscure Omaha-based \ncompany into a world leader, renowned for both its taste for risk and its Gibraltar-like financial strength. Moreover, Greg, our directors and I all have a very large investment in Berkshire in \nrelation to any compensation we receive. We do not use options or other one-sided forms of \ncompensation; if you  lose money, so do we. This approach encourages caution but does not \nensure foresight. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nP/C insurance growth  is dependent on increased economic risk. No risk – no need for \ninsurance. \nThink back only 135 years when the world had no autos, trucks or airplanes. Now there \nare 300 million vehicles in the U.S. alone, a massive fleet causing huge damage daily. Property damage arising from hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires is massive, growing and increasingly unpredictable in their patterns and eventual costs. \n9 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 9 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nIt would be foolish – make that madness – to write ten-year policies for these coverages, \nbut we believe one-year assumption of such risk s is generally manageable. If we change our \nminds, we will change the contracts we offer. Du ring my lifetime, auto insurers have generally \nabandoned one-year policies and switched to the six-month variety. This change reduced  float \nbut allowed more intelligent underwriting. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nNo private insurer has the willingness to take on the amount of risk that Berkshire can \nprovide. At times, this advantage can be important. But we also need to shrink  when prices are \ninadequate. We must never  write inadequately-priced policies in order to stay in the game. That \npolicy is corporate suicide. \nProperly pricing P/C insurance is part art, part  science and is definitely not a business for \noptimists. Mike Goldberg, the Berkshire executive who recruited Ajit, said it best: “We want our \nunderwriters to daily come to work nervous, but not paralyzed.” \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAll things considered, we like the P/C insurance business. Berkshire can financially and \npsychologically handle extreme losses without blinking. We are also not dependent on reinsurers and that gives us a material and enduring cost advantage. Finally, we have outstanding managers (no optimists) and are particularly well-situated to utilize the substantial sums P/C insurance \ndelivers for investment. \nOver the past two decades, our insurance business has generated $32 billion of after-tax \nprofits from underwriting, about 3.3 cents per dollar of sales after income tax. Meanwhile, our \nfloat has grown from $46 billion to $171 billion. The float is likely to grow a bit over time and, \nwith intelligent underwriting (and some luck), has a reasonable prospect of being costless. \nBerkshire Increases its Japanese Investments \nA small but important exception to our U.S.-based focus is our growing investment in \nJapan. \nIt’s been almost six years since Berkshire began purchasing shares in five Japanese \ncompanies that very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself. The \nfive are (alphabetically) ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. Each of these large enterprises, in turn, owns interests in a vast array of businesses, many based in Japan but others that operate throughout the world. \n10 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 10 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nBerkshire made its first purchases involving the five in July 2019. We simply looked at \ntheir financial records and were amazed at the low prices of their stocks. As the years have \npassed, our admiration for these companies has consistently grown. Greg has met many times with them, and I regularly follow their progress. Both of us like their capital deployment, their managements and their attitude in respect to their investors. \nEach of the five companies increase dividends when appropriate, they repurchase their \nshares when it is sensible to do so, and their top managers are far less aggressive in their compensation programs than their U.S. counterparts. \nOur holdings of the five are for the very long term, and we are committed to supporting \ntheir boards of directors. From the start, we also agreed to keep Berkshire’s holdings below 10% of each company’s shares. But, as we approached this limit, the five companies agreed to moderately relax the ceiling. Over time , you will likely see Berkshire’s ownership of all five \nincrease somewhat. \nAt yearend, Berkshire’s aggregate cost (in dollars) was $13.8 billion and the market value \nof our holdings totaled $23.5 billion. \nMeanwhile, Berkshire has consistently – but not pursuant to any formula – increased its \nyen-denominated borrowings. All are at fixed rates, no “floaters.” Greg and I have no view on \nfuture foreign exchange rates and therefore seek a position approximating currency-neutrality. We are required, however, under GAAP rules to regularly recognize in our earnings a calculation of any gains or losses in the yen we have bo rrowed and, at yearend, had included $2.3 billion of \nafter-tax gains due to dollar strength of which $850 million occurred in 2024. \nI expect that Greg and his eventual successors will be holding this Japanese position for \nmany decades and that Berkshire will find other ways to work productively with the five companies in the future. \nWe like the current math of our yen-balanced strategy as well. As I write this, the annual \ndividend income expected from the Japanese investments in 2025 will total about $812 million and the interest cost of our yen-denominated debt will be about $135 million. \nThe Annual Gathering in Omaha \nI hope you will join us in Omaha on May 3\nrd. We are following a somewhat changed \nschedule this year, but the basics remain the same. Our goal is that you get many of your \nquestions answered, that you connect with friends, and that you leave with a good impression of Omaha. The city looks forward to your visits. \n11 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 11 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nWe will have much the same group of volunteers to offer you a wide variety of Berkshire \nproducts that will lighten your wallet and brighten your day. As usual, we will be open on Friday \nfrom noon until 5 p.m. with lovable Squishmallows, underwear from Fruit of the Loom, Brooks running shoes and a host of other items to tempt you. \nAgain, we will have only one book for sale. Last year we featured Poor Charlie’s \nAlmanack  and sold out – 5,000 copies disappeared before the close of business on Saturday. \nThis year we will offer 60 Years of Berkshire Hathaway . In 2015, I asked Carrie Sova, \nwho among her many duties managed much of the activity at the annual meeting, to try her hand at putting together a light-hearted history of Berkshire. I gave her full reign to use her imagination, and she quickly produced a book that blew me away with its ingenuity, contents and design. \nSubsequently, Carrie left Berkshire to raise a family and now has three children. But each \nsummer, the Berkshire office force gets together to watch the Omaha Storm Chasers play baseball against a Triple A opponent. I ask a few alums to join us, and Carrie usually comes with her family. At this year’s event, I brazenly asked her if she would do a 60\nth Anniversary issue, \nfeaturing Charlie’s photos, quotes and stories that have seldom been made public. \nEven with three young children to manage, Carrie immediately said “yes.” Consequently, \nwe will have 5,000 copies of the new book available for sale on Friday afternoon and from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. \nCarrie refused any payment for her extensive work on the new “Charlie” edition. I \nsuggested she and I co-sign 20 copies to be given to any shareholder contributing $5,000 to the Stephen Center that serves homeless adults and children in South Omaha. The Kizer family, beginning with Bill Kizer, Sr., my long-time friend and Carrie’s grandfather, have for decades been assisting this worthy institution. Whatever is raised through the sale of the 20 autographed books, I will match. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nBecky Quick will cover our somewhat re-engineered gathering on Saturday. Becky \nknows Berkshire like a book and always arranges interesting interviews with managers, investors, shareholders and an occasional celebrity. She and her CNBC crew do a great job of both transmitting our meetings worldwide and archiving much Berkshire-related material. Give our director, Steve Burke, credit for the archive idea. \nWe will not have a movie this year but rather will convene a bit earlier at 8 a.m. I will \nmake a few introductory remarks, and we will promptly get to the Q&A, alternating questions between Becky and the audience. \n12 \nDocket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \nSurrebuttal Schedule \nBPL-S-3, p. 12 of 15\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT- \nNOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED\nGreg and Ajit will join me in answering questions and we will take a half-hour break at \n10:30 a.m. When we reconvene at 11:00 a.m., only Greg will join me on stage. This year we will \ndisband at 1:00 p.m. but stay open for shopping in the exhibit area until 4:00 p.m. \nYou can find the full details regarding weekend activities on page 16. Note particularly \nthe always-popular Brooks run on Sunday morning. (I will be sleeping.) \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nMy wise and good-looking sister, Bertie, of whom I wrote last year, will be attending the \nmeeting along with two of her daughters, both good-looking as well. Observers all agree that the genes producing this dazzling result flow down only the female side of the family. (Sob.) \nBertie is now 91 and we talk regularly on Sundays using old-fashion telephones for \ncommunications. We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes. In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face. \nBut Bertie regularly one-ups me by asserting that she enjoys an additional benefit: When \na woman uses a cane, she tells me, men quit “hitting” on her. Bertie’s explanation is that the male ego is such that little old ladies with canes simply aren’t an appropriate target. Presently, I have no data to counter her assertion. \nBut I have suspicions. At the meeting I can’t see much from the stage, and I would \nappreciate it if attendees would keep an eye on Bertie. Let me know if the cane is really doing its job. My bet is that she will be surrounded  by males. For those of a certain age, the scene will \nbring back memories of Scarlett O’Hara and her horde of male admirers in Gone with the Wind. \n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nThe Berkshire directors and I immensely enjoy having you come to Omaha, and I predict \nthat you will have a good time and likely make some new friends. \nFebruary 22, 2025 Warren E.

Learn why this is important\nDear Public Utility Commission,\nI am writing to ask that you do not all the sale of Allete to GIP/Blackrock.  The reason is is\nthis:\nAllete is a PUBLIC utility, regulated by a PUBLIC commission, and GIP/Blackrock is a\nPRIVATE equity company, owned by PRIVATE investors. \nYour job is to insure publicly  regulated entities are operated in the interest of the public . \nIf you allow this sale, you will be betraying the trust people have in you and in governance-in-\ngeneral. \nI have long been an investor/stockholder in Allete, and am also long time customer of their\nsubsidiary Minnesota Power. I can choose where I wish to invest, but not where I purchaseutility services, including electricity.  \nIn our current political and economic environment there are already far too many over-\nempowered self-interested oligarchs doing things which are harmful to the general public. Toverify this all you need to do is pay attention to the daily news.\nSincerely,\nAndy Goldfine\nPS -  True story:  55 years ago my father and his brother and their mother owned and operated\na discount/department store in Duluth similar in size to a Target or Walmart, and when I wasaround 14 or my father gave a presentation to the board of Minnesota Power (before it wasAllete) and I accompanied him.  Inside the Minnesota Power HQ was a formal-lookingboardroom with a big long table, long enough for maybe twenty chairs. I took a side-chair nextto the wall to observe the proceedings. The large table was fully occupied. After my father'spresentation asking for everyone to  support the Duluth Chamber of Commerce cleaving-offits Visitor & Convention Bureau into a separate tourism marketing organization to be fundedby a hotel and restaurant tax, the leaders of Minnesota Power raised objections. What followedwas a strong discussion.  Eventually my dad lost his temper, slapped his open palm hard onthe table (which made a very loud noise) and thundered:  “That is the most asinine thing I’veever heard. If you believe that, I’m going to go back to my store now and put diesel generatorson the roof, and make my own electricity!!!” The principle was simple: ‘ we are all in this\ntogether’.  Private equity has no business owning any public utility.  (Eventually the Chamber\ndid become an independent marketing organization called ‘Visit Duluth’. )  We still are all in\nthis together.  Your job is to insure Allete never forgets this.  \nConfidentiality Notice:   This e-mail message, including any attachments, is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain\nconfidential and privileged information.

Learn why this is important\nTo the PUC,\nI am writing regarding  Docket Number 24-198, and the intended deal to sell\nMinnesota Power to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and\nGlobal Infrastructures (GIP). \nI, along with researchers from the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and\nothers, urge you to reject this deal.\nAs a private citizen who uses MP electricity, my primary interests are in\nmoving to clean energy while keeping prices as low as possible through thetransition. I do not see why \"going private\" will bring them more capitalmarkets than they can acquire in the public square. \nMore importantly: Just like bees must make honey, a corporation must turn\na profit and satisfy its shareholders. You can't really ask it to do anythingelse. All you can do is restrict how well it can do that (or not). Public good is\ngenerally better served with open and transparent processes so that the\npublic can see what is going on and knows who or what is responsible whenprices change. The structure of Minnesota Power will dictate how well itserves the public, regardless of the morals of decision-makers in eithercase. \nThank you for taking the time to give this matter its due.\nBest,\nKatya Gordon\nTwo Harbors, MN\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

The sale of MN Power to Canada’s Pension Plan and GIP could not come at a worse time,particularly considering the political tensions between our two countries. Moreover, MN Power still needs to be held accountable for the overcharging of rate payers in2024, where the utility collected millions more than it was authorized to by regulartoryagencies. While MN Power has acknowledged this, I, as a customer, have yet to see any of myoverpayments refunded. Allowing the same of MN Power to a new owner could help tocomplicate the matter of making rate payers whole. Nevermind that it is presumed that we will all be charged significantly more for our powershould this deal go through. Access to electricity is a basic necessity of our lives. When wewere stuck paying over $400/month during most of 2024, you can imagine the burden thatplaces on families. Now imagine that we are asked to spend even more! I am steadfastly against this proposed sale. Best Regards,\nMatt Pedersen\nDuluth, MN\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

I am here tohelp people heal and process the emotions and difficult events of life.\n I am writing to express my dissent and concern around the proposed acquisition of Minnesota\nPower by BlackRock; it is not in the public’s interest and \nI’m asking the Public Utilities\nCommission to deny the proposal.\nPrivate equity investors demand higher profits than normal market investors. We can see that\nBlackRock does not put people over profit, because they play a large part in, and profit off thedeforestation of the Amazon Rainforest.\nWe can also look to other places where acquisitions of this type have occurred… One utility in\nTexas taken over by private equity went bankrupt, another owned by private equity inMichigan has much higher residential rates than the neighboring co-op utilities also servingMichigan’s UP.  \nI also feel concerned about the conflict of interest with Blackrock’s commitment to spending\n100 Billion dollars in AI Data centers throughout the world, and how these data centers arebeing proposed in Minnesota as of recently.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 I. INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ Please state your name, title, and employer. 2 \nA My name is Courtney Lane. I am a Senior Principal at Synapse Energy Economics 3 \n(“Synapse ”), located at 485 Massachusetts Avenue, #3, Cambridge, M assachusetts  4 \n02139. 5 \nQ Have you previously submitted testimony in this proceeding?   6 \nA Yes. I submitted direct testimony in this proceeding on behalf of the Sierra Club on 7 \nFebruary  4, 2025. 8 \nQ What is the purpose of your surrebuttal  testimony?  9 \nA The purpose of my testimony is to respond to the Rebuttal Testimony of Andrew Alley 10 \non behalf of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP Investments”), the Rebuttal 11 \nTestimony of Jonathan Bram on behalf of Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”, 12 \ncollectively referred to wi th CPP Investments as “the Partners”), and the Rebuttal 13 \nTestimon ies of Colin Anderson, Ann Bulkley , Jennifer Cady , Ellen Lapson, Jeffery 14 \nScissons, and Joshua Taran on behalf of ALLETE d/b/a Minnesota Power (“the 15 \nCompany”). 16 \nQ How is your surrebuttal testimony  structured ?  17 \nA In Section II, I summarize my conclusions and recommendations. In Section III, I discuss 18 \nthe lack of justification for the proposed acquisition of all outstanding shares of ALLETE 19 \nby the Partners (“the Acquisition”) on the basis of the Compan y’s capital needs.  In 20 \nSection IV, I respond to arguments raised by the Company and Partner s (together, the 21 \n“Applicants”) in Rebuttal Testimony concerning my argument that the Acquisition will 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n2 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 increase risks for ratepayers. In Section V, I respond to Rebutt al Testimony regarding my 1 \nclaim that the Acquisition could negatively affect the Company’s ability to invest in clean 2 \nenergy resources and retire coal -fired power plants in compliance with Minnesota ’s 3 \nCarbon Free Standard and environmental regulations. In Section VI, I argue why 4 \ncommitments made in Rebuttal Testimony do not alleviate concerns about the 5 \nAcquisition reducing local control over the Company. In Section VI, I argue why despite 6 \narguments made in Rebuttal Testimony to the contrary, concerns about lack of 7 \ntransparency from the Partners provide a reason to reject the Acquisition. Finally, in 8 \nSection VIII, I again summarize my conclusions and recommendations.  9 \nII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  10 \nQ Do the Applicants summarize commitments within rebuttal testimony?  11 \nA Yes. Witness Cady’s Rebuttal  Testimony Schedule 1 summariz es commitments and 12 \naffirmations by the Applicants , some of which are new and some of which were 13 \ncontained in the Company’s original Petition  or direct testimony .1 However, Schedule 1 14 \nin Witness Cady’s Rebuttal does not make clear which commitments are new and which 15 \nare existing. Following are several  of the Applicants’ commitments  which  pertain to 16 \naspects of my D irect and Surrebuttal T estimony :  17 \n                                                 \n1 Rebuttal Testimony of Jennifer Cady (hereinafter, “Cady Rebuttal”), Schedule 1  at 1 (noting \nthat Schedule 1 “specifies new commitments Minnesota Power, GIP, and CPP Investments are making to address the comments of Intervenors, as well as those commitment s previously \nstated in the Merger Agreement, Petition, and Direct Testimony ” (emphasis added)).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n3 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 • “Alloy Parent commits to prov ide to Minnesota Power equity financing, including 1 \nbut not limited  to equity infusion, deferral or reinvestment of dividends, or a 2 \ncombination of both, in an amount at least equal to the equity financing required to 3 \nfund Minnesota Power’s 5 -year capital investment plan reflected in its February 4 \n2025 10- K filing,  subject to prospective reasonable and prudent plan 5 \nadjustments. ”2  6 \n•  The Applicants make the following commitments  about the post-Acquisition 7 \nALLETE Board and governance: 8 \no The Company previously commi tted in its original Petition that “at least 9 \none member of the ALLETE Board of Directors must be from Minnesota, 10 \none member must be from Wisconsin, and the Board must have at least two 11 \nindependent directors” and that ALLETE’s chief executive officer (“CEO” ) 12 \nwill be  a Board member.3 The Company slightly modifies this commitment 13 \nin Rebuttal, stating that “[i] n addition to the ALLETE CEO, the ALLETE 14 \nboard will include two independent members, with one member from 15 \n                                                 \n2 Id.  \n3 Docket No. E015/PA-24- 198, Initial Filing – Petition for Approval (Minn.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Minnesota and one member from Wisconsin, each of whom will be a 1 \nvoting member.”4 2 \no “The ALLETE CEO’s board seat will not count as the director from the 3 \nState of Minnesota or State of Wisconsin on the post-Acquisition Board of 4 \nDirectors. ”5 5 \no The CEO of ALLETE will be a voting member of the post-Acquisition 6 \nALLETE board of directors.6 7 \no The Partners commit that the ALLETE board will include “13 total board 8 \nmembers, with each investor having the right to appoint one director to the 9 \nboard for every 10 percent ownership of ALLETE, Inc. held  indirectly 10 \nthrough Alloy Parent.”7 11 \nThe Applicants make the following commitments regarding affiliated interests:  12 \no “Minnesota Power will require all suppliers, and any industrial customers 13 \nwith contracted rates, to identify annually whether they are more than 5 % 14 \nowned by CPPIB, GIP, or Blackrock. Minnesota Power will list those 15 \nentities in the annual affiliated interest report. ”8 16 \n                                                 \n4 Cady Rebuttal , Schedule 1 at 2. \n5 Id. \n6 Id. \n7 Id. \n8 Id. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n5 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

Specific to the issues raised in my Direct 9 \nTestimony, the Acquis ition still poses several probable harms to the public interest:   10 \n• The Acquisition increases incentives for the Company to pursue its capital 11 \ninvestment plans in ways that are not cost- effective for ratepayers due to a bias 12 \ntoward capital projects over oth er approaches.  13 \n• The Acquisition increases the risk that operation of the Boswell coal -fired power 14 \nplant may be prolonged, which would undermine the Company’s stated clean 15 \nenergy goals.  16 \n• The Partners’ control over ALLETE’s board raises concerns about the degr ee to 17 \nwhich the board could be influenced in non- transparent ways to take action 18 \ncontrary to the public interest. 19 \n                                                 \n9 Id. at 3.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n6 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 • The Acquisition removes access to important financial information about the 1 \nultimate owners of ALLETE, harming the abilities of regulators and  stakeholders 2 \nto hold the Company and the Partners accountable. 3 \nQ Please summarize your recommendations.  4 \nA The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”)   should not approve the 5 \nproposed Acquisition  because the potential harms of the transaction for Minnesota 6 \nratepayers outweigh the uncertain, theoretical  benefits, and the Acquisition is therefore 7 \nnot consistent with the public interest.      8 \nIII. THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED A NEED FOR THIS 9 \nACQUISITION. 10 \nQ What is your claim about the Company’s capital needs?  11 \nA Throughout both direct and r ebuttal t estimony, ALLETE and the Partners claim without 12 \nevidence that the Acquisition is the best way to obtain the capital the Company need s 13 \ngoing forward. In my Direct Testimony, I noted that the Company has not cited any 14 \ninstance of being unable to obtain enough capital on public markets.10  This fact remains 15 \nunrebutted because, i n rebuttal testimony, the Company and Partner witnesses still have 16 \nnot cited any such instance.  17 \n                                                 \n10 Public Redacted Direct Testimony of Courtney Lane (hereinafter “Lane Direct  (Public) ”) at \n11:9-12:8 . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n7 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q Witness Taran claims this argument from your D irect T estimony is concerned with 1 \nthe past and “ignores the drastic change in circumstances going forward,” pointing 2 \nto projections that the Company’s future capital need “far outweighs” its historical 3 \nneed.11 Does his argument demonstrate that the Ac quisition is necessary to raise this 4 \nneeded capital?  5 \nA No. Witness Taran provides no evidence that the Company’s future capital needs, while 6 \ngreater than the past, will reach  some threshold where the Company cannot fulf ill those 7 \nneeds  via  public markets.  Witness Taran simply asserts that “ [a]ttempting to issue this 8 \nlevel of equity in public markets creates an enormous amount of risk for the Company 9 \nand its stakeholders.”12 But he never backs up this statement with an analysis 10 \ndemonstrating why this specific level of capital need would trigger such risks.  11 \nQ Are there ways to raise additional equity capital that would not trigger such risks 12 \nand do not require the Acquisition?  13 \nA Yes. One example would be for ALLETE to sell off some or all of its nonutility 14 \nsubsidiary businesses. Doing so would raise equity for Minnesota Power, while allowing 15 \nthe Company to focus on being a pure ly regulated utility business. Such a utility -focused 16 \nbusiness may enhance ALLETE’s appeal to conservative investors who typically bu y 17 \nstock in low- risk utility companies and have the willingness to temporarily forego 18 \ndividends that Witness Taran says the Company needs. 19 \n                                                 \n11 Rebuttal Testimony of Joshua Taran (hereinafter, “Taran Rebuttal”) at 29 -30. \n12 Id. at 18. \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n8 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q Witness Taran argues that the public markets are insufficient to generate the equity 1 \nthe C ompany needs because of the need to pay dividends, while the Partners, on the 2 \nother hand, would be willing to forego dividends.13 Does this argument show that 3 \nthe A cquisition is necessary  to fulfill capital needs ? 4 \nA No. Witness Taran provides no analysis to back up the claim that the Company cannot 5 \nmeet its capital needs without equity investors foregoing dividends. For example, 6 \nWitness Taran notes that the anticipated dividend payments for the Company are $170 7 \nmillion in 2025.14 However, Witness Taran does not assert th at $170 million in foregone 8 \ndividends would be sufficient to make the difference between raising enough equity in 9 \nthe relevant period or not. 10 \nIV. CAPITAL BIAS AND THE PARTNERS’ ABILITY TO  CONTROL FUTURE 11 \nINVESTMENT DECISIONS    12 \nQ Please summarize your argument s in your D irect Testimony regarding risks to 13 \nratepayers from the proposed Acquisition.  14 \nA In my D irect T estimony, I argued that if the Acquisition is completed, the Partners will 15 \nlikely attempt to increase the total return from ALLETE’s rate base and in this attempt 16 \nwill like ly pursue a capital -intensive resource development strategy that exacerbates the 17 \nutility’s existing incentives to minimize or overlook options that are more cost- effective 18 \nfor ratepayers.15 I argued that both theory and empirical evidence demonstrate that t he 19 \nPartners would attempt to increase returns post-Acquisition.16 The Partners would not 20 \n                                                 \n13 Id. at 9 -10. \n14 Id. at 9.  \n15 See Lane Direct  (Public) at 14 -21.  \n16 Id. at 14:19-16:13.  \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n9 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 propose taking the Company private if they did not believe doing so could lead to a 1 \nhigher return. Moreover, I explained that empirical evidence indicates that private equity 2 \ncompanies tend to enjoy greater returns than publicly- traded utilities .17 3 \nQ Do the Partners or ALLETE respond to these concerns?  4 \nA Not directly. Neither the Partners nor ALLETE disputed my arguments that in pursuit of 5 \nhigher returns on rate base, the post-Acquisition Company would be more heavily 6 \nincentivized to focus on capital-intensive options and overlook lower -cost demand -side 7 \nsolutions like grid -enhancing technologies, distributed resource management, or energy 8 \nefficiency. Some w itnesses partially r esponded to the concerns about the Company 9 \noverlooking power purchase agreements (“PPAs ”), which I will address later in this 10 \ntestimony . 11 \nQ Witness Bulkley claims that your position “fails to take into consideration the fact 12 \nthat as owners of ALLETE, the [P] artners have the ability to implement strategies 13 \nthat meet the clean energy transition goals of Minnesota Power as well as other 14 \nregulated and non- regulated investments that ALLETE will need to make in the 15 \nfuture, which cannot be implemented as stock market  investors.”18 Do you agree? 16 \nA No. My argument is not inconsistent with th e claim s that the Partners  would make 17 \ninvestments in ALLETE and that the Partners’ acquisition of the Company could enable 18 \nthe Partners to implement their preferred strategies. But the  Partners’  preferred strateg ies 19 \nnonetheless are likely to involve driving a higher return on investment than they could 20 \ngain from ALLETE as stock market investors. Witness Bulkley seems to be implying that 21 \n                                                 \n17 Id. at 15:12-16:2 . \n18 Rebuttal Testimony of Ann Bulkley (hereinafter, “Bulkley Rebuttal”) at 8 -9. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n10 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 a higher return is irrelevant to the goals of the Partners, which is not believable.  At the 1 \nsame time, she also claims that “ [a]ccomplishing this transition will substantially increase 2 \nthe value of ALLETE,”19 which seems to be an admission that returns will increase post- 3 \nAcquisition. 4 \nQ Witness Bulkley argue s that the Commission’s ability to review capital investments 5 \nbefore they are placed into service “creates the appropriate incentive to ensure that 6 \nutilities make sound investment decisions for customers” and alleviates concerns 7 \nthat any unnecessary capita l investments would be made “when operating expenses 8 \nwould have sufficed.”20 Do you agree? 9 \nA No. Witness Bulkley is ignoring the extent to which the Company itself has influence 10 \nover what the Commission is able to review. For example, Witness Bulkley refers to the 11 \nCommission’s role in Integrated Resource Plan (“ IRP”) proceeding s,  but the Company 12 \ncreates the menu of resource options that the Commission reviews in an IRP. At that 13 \npoint, the Commission is effectively limited to the menu of choices that the Compa ny has 14 \npresented  when making its final decision . If that menu is biased toward capital 15 \ninvestments  in lieu of  operating expenses, the Commission  can try to mitigate this bias 16 \nby disallowing certain aspects of the IRP, but it cannot craft a new resource plan without 17 \nutility cooperation.   18 \nFurthermore, w hile it is true that parties can  review and comment on an  IRP or rate case 19 \napplication , the utility will always have the most technical knowledge and information 20 \nregarding its  systems , load forecasts,  and models, and on the relative costs of alternatives. 21 \n                                                 \n19 Id. at 9.  \n20 Id. at 11. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n11 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 This is often referred to as information asymmetry . Parties and regulators face a 1 \nsignificant information disadvantage, which makes it challenging to  fully vet the 2 \nprudence of utility investment decis ions.   3 \nThe incentives the Company will face post -Acquisition and the pressure from the 4 \nPartners to increase return s will operate as a countervailing force that may impede or 5 \ncomplicate the Commission ’s efforts to ensure that the Company’s resource planning and 6 \ninvestments  are in the best interests of ratepayers . While the Commission’s oversight role 7 \ncan curb a utility’s excesses, i t is better to have a utility that acts as a partner and 8 \nproposes sound investment decisions from the beginning . As I explained  in my Direct 9 \nTestimony, the Acquisition would exacerbate incentives that make the Company more 10 \nlikely to act in ways that are not in ratepayers’ best interest . 11 \nQ In response to your argument in d irect testimony that the Company may overlook 12 \nlower- cost resources like PPAs in favor of capital -intensive options, Witnesses 13 \nBram21 and Taran22 claim these concerns are misplaced because new resources are 14 \nselected as part of competitive processes that mitigate the ability of the Company to 15 \nprefer self -build options over PPAs. Do you agree with their responses?  16 \nA No. Both  witnesses ignore the fact that even under a competitive process that is 17 \nindependently evaluated, such as an all -source request for proposals, there are subjective 18 \nfactors that help determine what resources win the resulting bid. These subjective factors 19 \ncan include, for example, the Company’s judgments about the experience level of the 20 \nbidders. The Company can choose to favor its self-build options by emphasizing certain 21 \n                                                 \n21 Rebuttal Testimony of Jonathan Bram (hereinafter, “Bram Rebuttal”) at 17.  \n22 Taran Rebuttal at 31.  \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n12 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 subjective factors over others. Factors like these have caused other regulatory 1 \ncommissions to take steps to ensure that certain percentages of competitive solicitations 2 \nare reserved for PPAs with third parties.23 Post-Acquisition, t he Company would be 3 \nunder greater pressure to pursue more capital -intensive self -build options over PPAs and 4 \nother lower- cost alternatives in order to increase returns from rate base.  5 \nQ Witness Bram claims that your D irect T estimony argued that “existing plans, 6 \nincluding the Commission- approved balanced selection process, should be 7 \nmaterially modified to favor [PPAs] in lieu of constructing generation.”24 Is this an 8 \naccurate description of your testimony?  9 \nA No. I have never argued that PPAs should be favored in the resource selection process , 10 \nonly that they should be allowed to compete on a level playing field. My argument was 11 \nand remains  that the Company has incentives to prefer constructing its own generation 12 \nrather than signing PPAs, and that these incentives wou ld be stronger post-Acquisition, 13 \nso the Commission should be vigilant to ensure that the Company is not overlooking 14 \nopportunities for PPAs. This argument does not imply that PPAs should always be 15 \npreferred to constructing generation as a rule. This misinterpretation of my argument 16 \nseems to carry over to Witness Alley’s Rebuttal Testimony, where he claims that “some 17 \nParties seem to assume . . . that the Company can meet all of its Carbon Free Standard 18 \nobligations through power purchase agreements and other companies building all 19 \n                                                 \n23 For example,  in Michigan Public Service Commission Case No. U-20165, Consumers Energy \nagreed to utilize a 50/50 capacity procurement structure whereby Consumers Energy would purchase 50% of future capacity needs through PPAs with third parties.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 necessary transmission.”25 But I never claimed that all of the Company’s Carbon Free 1 \nStandard obligations can be met through PPAs or third- party contracts . 2 \nQ Witness Bram  asserts that “ [u]tilizing PPAs to achieve clean energy goals often is 3 \nmuch more costly than Company -owned generation” and he claims that renewable 4 \nPPA prices are volatile and increasing.26 How do you respond?  5 \nA I do not disagree that there are times when Company- owned generat ion may be more 6 \ncost-effective than PPAs; however, the renewable energy PPA price data provided by 7 \nWitness Bram is misleading. Witness Bram provides a graph of PPA prices since 2021 8 \nfor wind, blended, and solar.27 Yet he fails to compare the PPA prices to the levelized 9 \ncost of energy should the utility self-build those same resources. While PPA prices have 10 \nincreased since 2021 due to factors like supply chain issues and inflation, those same 11 \nmarket conditions are also impacting utility -owned generation. For example, the most 12 \nrecent Lazard Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis report shows a similar spike in prices 13 \nfor those resources from 2021-2024.28 14 \nFurthermore, the implication that PPAs are usually much more expensive is undercut by 15 \nWitness Taran’s Rebuttal Testimony. He states that “the Company’s projected capital 16 \nexpenditure forecast already assumes some level of resource additions are served through 17 \nPPAs,” and notes that the majority of the remaining 100 MW of solar projected to be 18 \n                                                 \n25 Rebuttal Testimony of Andrew Alley (hereinafter, “Alley Rebuttal”) at 25.  \n26 Bram Rebuttal at 17 -18. \n27 Id. at 18. \n28 Lazard Levelized Cost of Energy, 17 (June 2024), available at  \nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards -lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf . \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n14 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

I did 11 \nnot argue that the Company post-Acquisition will be motivated to build new resources in 12 \nexcess of what is required to comply with the Carbon Free Standard. Rather, my 13 \nargument is that the Company, in pursuit of higher returns, will be incentivized to try to 14 \ncomply with the Carbon Free Standard in ways that are not the most cost- effective for 15 \nratepayers  by foregoing least -cost compliance options. The  risk that the Partn ers may 16 \npressure the Company to overinvest is likely to increase the cost of the Company’s plans 17 \nfor complying with the Carbon Free Standard , but this point about overinvestment does 18 \nnot involve the separate question of whether  the Company complies with th e standard  at 19 \nall. 20 \n                                                 \n29 Taran Rebuttal at 16.  \n30 Id. at 31. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n15 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

THE PARTNERS CONTINUE TO  AVOID AFFIRMATIVE COMMITMEN TS 6 \nTO INVEST IN CLEAN RESOURCES AND RETIRE COAL PLANTS .   7 \nQ Please summarize the issues you raised in your Direct T estimony regarding the 8 \nimpact of the Acquisition on Minnesota Power ’s ability  to comply with the Carbon 9 \nFree Standard . 10 \nA In my Direct Testimony, I raised two risks related to the Acquisition:  11 \n1. The Partners could exit and sell their shares of ALLETE prior to the Company 12 \nretiring its coal generation. There is no guarantee that the next owners of 13 \nALLETE will support Minnesota Power’s plans to cease op eration of its coal 14 \nunits, and those future owners are likely to seek control of the ALLETE Board, 15 \nwhich includes approval of Minnesota Power’s budgets and business plans.31    16 \n2. There is no guarantee within the merger agreement that the Partners will not seek 17 \nto change the Company’s planned coal retirement dates after the Acquisition is 18 \ncomplete.32   19 \n                                                 \n31 Lane Direct (Public) at 34:3-8. \n32 Id. at 34:1-3. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n16 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q How do the Applicants respond to your concerns regarding when the Partners 1 \nmight sell their interests in ALLETE?  2 \nA The Partners commit to provide sufficient capital to fund the Company’s five- year capital 3 \ninvestment plan  as reflected in its February 25 10K filing , subject to all existing 4 \nCommission regulation and decision- making.33 However, the Partners still have not 5 \ncommitted to maintain their ownership of ALLETE  for any particular length of time.  6 \nIn addition, Witness Bram indicates that the parties to this proceeding should not be 7 \nconcerned about a potential future sale of ALLETE by the Partners because any future 8 \nsale of Minnesota Power by the Partners will be s ubject to approval by the 9 \nCommission .34 Witness Bram goes on to assert  that this requirement provides customer 10 \nprotection as the Commission will ensure that the “terms and timing of any future 11 \ntransactions are in the public interest.”35     12 \nQ Does the new commitment made by the Partners to fund Minnesota Power’s five- 13 \nyear capital plan address your concerns?  14 \nA No. ALLETE’s five -year capital plan as provided in its February 2025 Form 10-K only 15 \nextends to 2029.36 This date is prior to the Company’s plan to cease coal  operations at 16 \nBoswell Unit 3 by 2030 and Boswell Unit 4 by 2035.  17 \n                                                 \n33 Cady Rebuttal, Schedule 1 at 1.   \n34 Bram Rebuttal  at 23 :7-11. \n35 Id. at 23:12. \n36 ALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10- K, 62 (February 13, 2025), available at  \nhttps://investor.allete.com/static -files/b85c9f8e- 24a2 -4a28- b1f9-c39f9a99090a , excerpt \nprovided as Attachment CLS-2. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n17 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q How do you respond to the Partners’ assurances that the Commission must approve 1 \nany sale of ALLETE by the Partners ?   2 \nA I find the Partners fail to appreciate the risks associated with the fu ture sale of ALLETE. 3 \nThere is no guarantee that the next owner of ALLETE will support Minnesota Power’s 4 \nplans to cease operation of its coal units. A future buyer may seek to modify coal 5 \nretirement timelines or change investment priorities.  6 \nWhile it is true that the Commission will need to approve any future sale of ALLETE , 7 \nwhether  the resulting outcome is in the public interest depends upon the choices 8 \npresented. For example, if the Commission were forced to decide in some future 9 \nproceeding between continued ownership by Partners  that are no longer interested in 10 \nowning ALLETE and  a new prospective owner that may not be supportive of ALLETE’s  11 \ntransition to clean energy, there would be no good outcome  for ratepayers. If the 12 \nCommission rejected  the sale, it would be left with owners that may rather deploy equity 13 \ncapital to  their other companies than  to ALLETE. In this instance, there would be  14 \nnothing the Commission can do to require the Partners to continue to provide equity 15 \ncapital t o ALLETE. This creates a significant risk because should this Acquisition be 16 \napproved; ALLETE will be fully dependent on the Partners for access to equity capital.   17 \nQ Do the Partners commit to adhere to the current schedule for the Boswell coal unit 18 \nretirements ?   19 \nA No. The Par tners do not offer any commitments to adhere to the current schedule for 20 \nBoswell coal unit retirements. Witness Cady simply states that “ [n]either ALLETE’s 21 \ncurrent owners, nor the Partners if the Acquisition were approved, have the ability to 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n18 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 direct rate-recovered investments or power plant retirement dates without Commission 1 \napproval.”37   2 \nQ Does the need for Commission  approval address your concerns that the Partners  3 \ncould seek to delay  the Boswell coal unit retirement dates?  4 \nA No. Witness Cady’s  statement is purely semantics. Of course the Commission ultimately 5 \nhas the authority to approve requests for cost-recovery of investments and plant closures. 6 \nBut it would be wrong to suggest that Minnesota Power bears no responsibility for its 7 \nresource retirement decisions simply because those choices must ultimately be approved 8 \nby the Commission. The Company’s resource planning choices matter. The Company 9 \ncould drag its feet in developing replacement resources for Boswell, and then choose to 10 \nseek Commission approval to postpone the Boswell retirement dates after the Acquisition 11 \nis approved, or the Company  could work vigorously to ensure it has resources in pl ace to 12 \ncomply with the current retirement dates. A commitment by the Company not to seek to 13 \npostpone the Boswell coal retirement  dates would have meaningful value,  and the 14 \nCommission’s oversight authority does not excuse the Partners’ refusal to make that 15 \ncommitment.  16 \nIn Minnesota Power’s last IRP process, the Commission ordered that “Minnesota Power 17 \nmust cease coal operations at Boswell Unit 3 at the latest by December 31, 2029, and 18 \n                                                 \n37 Cady Rebuttal  at 12 :2-4. \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n19 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Boswell Unit 4 by 2035.”38 If the purpose of the Acquisition is truly to “invest in the 1 \nclean energy transition”39 then the Partners should have no problem committing to 2 \nmeeting this coal plant retirement schedule as part of the merger agreement.  3 \nWithout a binding, enforceable commitment by the Applicants (in the Merger Agreement 4 \nor elsewhere) to honor the existing coal plant retirement dates , there is nothing preventing 5 \nthe Partners from changing their position and seeking to postpone those retirement dates 6 \nafter the Acquisition is approved.   7 \nQ Do the Partners offer any commitments  in rebuttal to adhere to Minnesota’s 8 \nCarbon Free Standard? 9 \nA No. The Applicants only affirm that  “[t]he Partners and Minnesota Power commit to 10 \nefforts to achieve Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard with least cost pathways to 11 \ncompliance ultimately determined b y the Commission in IRP and related dockets.”40 12 \nThis is not a meaningful commitment. Through this affirmation, the Applicants  don’t 13 \nactually commit to achieving the Carbon Free Standard, they only commit to “efforts to 14 \nachieve” the standard, which is not t he same thing . Putting in  effort does not guarantee an 15 \noutcome. Moreover, the level of effort can vary depending on the future priories of the 16 \nPartners.   17 \n                                                 \n38 In the Matter of Minn.

The Carbon Free Standard requires Minnesota 9 \nPower to supply Minnesota customers with carbon- free electricity equal to 80% of retail 10 \nsales by 2030, 90% by 2035, and 100% by 2040.43 If the Partners sell their shares in 11 \nALLETE  in 2029, th ey would not be responsible for whether or not Minnesota Power is 12 \nultimately able to comply with the 100% Carbon Free Standard in 2040. As stated by 13 \nWitness Alley, “ [t]he statutory mandate to meet a specific standard of performance places 14 \nthe burden of com pliance clearly and directly on the utility.”44   15 \n                                                 \n41 Id. at. 1-2. \n42 Alley Rebuttal at 23 :19-20.43 Minn.

Specifically, the 6 \nCompany’s 2025-2039 IRP proposes to add over 1,000 MW of new natural gas  capacity , 7 \nwhile proposing 400 MW of new wind, 100 MW of new battery storage, and no new 8 \nsolar beyond the resources in its 2021 IRP.46  9 \nIn its IRP, Minnesota Power proposes converting Boswell Unit 3 to natural gas  by the 10 \nend of 2029 and considers two refuel ing options for Boswell Unit 4: a 40 percent 11 \nmethane gas refuel by 2030 or cofiring with biomass and natural gas by 2035.47 12 \nTo be clear, I am not offering an opinion on the adequacy of Minnesota Power’s IRP or 13 \nthe soundness of the IRP’s proposed resource portfolio. Those questions are outside the 14 \nscope of my testimony in this docket.

By contrast , other merger 11 \ncommitments in Cady Rebuttal Schedule 1 include specific commitment periods .  For 12 \nexample, the Applicants commit that “f or so  long as Minnesota Power is owned by the 13 \nPartners  … [ALLETE’s ] contributions to the Minnesota Power Foundation will not be 14 \nreduced. ”60 In addition, the Partners still do not commit to never influencing ALLETE 15 \nBoard decisions regarding who should be on Minne sota Power’s management team. 16 \nWhen asked in discovery if the Partners would commit to never influencing ALLETE 17 \n                                                 \n58 Alley Rebuttal at 35 :21-25. \n59 Id. \n60 Id. at 51:11-14. \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n26 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 VII. THE ACQUISITION WOULD STILL RESULT IN LES S TRANSPARENCY. 1 \nQ Briefly summarize your arguments about transparency.  2 \nA In my Direct Testimony, I argued that taking ALLETE private would deprive regulators 3 \nand the public of important insights into the Company’s operations and financial health, 4 \nprimarily because the private company would no longer need to report financial 5 \ninforma tion to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“ SEC”).64 6 \nQ Witness Anderson claims that the Company will already have to provide detailed 7 \ninformation to the Commission in proceedings such as IRP proceedings, and that 8 \nthese filings are more detailed than any SEC report.65 Does this argument alleviate 9 \nyour concerns?  10 \nA Not at all. This information discussed by Witness Anderson would all come at the 11 \noperating utility level. ALLETE would be under no obligation to provide detailed 12 \nfinancial information about its new p arents,  GIP and CPP. This lack of information could 13 \nharm the ability  of regulators and stakeholders to hold the new Company accountable to 14 \nthe public interest. For example, regulators and stakeholders would need parent- level 15 \nfinancial information to vet how long the Partners may be intending to hold ALLETE or 16 \ncertain ALLETE assets before a sale. SEC reporting could shed light on the parents ’ 17 \nfinancial situation , enabling  outside observers to judge when a sale may be forthcoming. 18 \nSuch reporting would not be available after the Acquisition is approved. 19 \n                                                 \n64 Lane Direct (Public) at 4 :11-15, 31:5-32:2 . \n65 Rebuttal Test imony of Colin Anderson (hereinafter, “Anderson Rebuttal”) at 11. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n28 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos. E-015/PA-24-198, M-24-383 Q Witness Lapson claims that “the reason that companies with publicly traded shares 1 \nare required to file financial reports is as a protection to investors, not to defend the 2 \ninterests of utility ratepayers against ‘profit- driven decisions.’”66 Do you agree with 3 \nWitness Lapson’s analy sis? 4 \nA No. These two purposes of SEC reporting are not mutually exclusive. It is true that SEC 5 \nreporting serves as a protection to investors. But it is nonetheless also true that 6 \ninformation found in such reports can also be used to defend ratepayer interests.  7 \nQ Witness Anderson states  that the Company will include in its annual capital 8 \nstructure petition “full audited consolidated financial statements” for Alloy 9 \nParent.67 Does that commitment alleviate your concerns about transparency?  10 \nA No. This commitme nt is not sufficient because it does not provide financial information 11 \nabout the Partners, GIP and CPP Investments . The Partners are the ultimate parents of 12 \nAlloy Parent . In order conduct robust oversight, for example, to assess when the Partners 13 \nmight be likely to sell ALLETE or certain ALLETE assets , regulators and stakeholders 14 \nwould need information on the ultimate parents, GIP and CPP, not just Alloy Parent. 15 \nVIII.  CONCLUSION  16 \nQ Please summarize your primary conclusions and recommendations.  17 \nA The Partners and  ALLE TE’s  rebuttal t estimony has failed to alleviate concerns raised by 18 \nmy D irect T estimony regarding  the Acquisition’s potential harms to the public interest 19 \nand has failed to demonstrate that the Acquisition is necessary. The Applicants’ r ebuttal 20 \ntestimony did not address my concern that the Partners ’ pursuit of higher returns will 21 \n                                                 \n66 Rebuttal Testimony of Ellen Lapson at 14. \n67 Anderson Rebuttal at 13. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT  \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED \n \n \n29 \nSurrebuttal Testimony of Courtney Lane     Docket Nos.

Minnesota Power’s last remaining source of baseload capable generation – the \nBEC – continues to play a critical role in providing reliable energy to residents, businesses, and \nthe unique industries that operate in northern Minnesota. As Minnesota Power advances its cease \ncoal plan at BEC Unit 3 (“BEC3”) and BEC Unit 4 (“BEC4”), reliable fuel source alternatives are \nnecessary before the Company can transition from existing coal generation. An innovative and \nnew approach to ensuring reliability was integrated into the planning process with the addition of \n“reliability criteria” designed to monitor and inform planning decisions. Minnesota Power is \ncommitted to replacing coal and has identified natural gas as the cleanest, most reliable, flexible, \nand least cost option to replace nearly 1,000 MW of baseload generation supported by BEC3 and \nBEC4 in order to continue providing 24/7 electricity service to Minnesota Power’s customers. \nAccordingly, to meet the Company’s existing customer load, the 2025 Plan calls for the refuel of \nBEC3 with natural gas by 2030 and the immediate development of combined cycle natural gas \ngeneration to replace power removed at the cease coal dates for Minnesota Power customers by \n2035 for BEC4. Additionally, the 2025 Plan incorporates future customer-driven activities like \nenergy conservation and demand response, as well as additional investigation into biomass as a \nfuel source to support dispatchable and baseload energy needs.  \nSustainability \nThe 2025 Plan offers bold next steps and necessary actions required to advance additional \ncarbon reductions and complying with Minnesota’s CFS while also considering the social and \neconomic needs of Minnesota Power’s customers and communities. The electric system must \ncontinue to provide increasingly sustainable and reliable sources of electricity that meets the \nnecessary physical criteria to protect customers. The Company continues to make progress on \nits 2021 Plan, including approximately 200 MW of additional utility-scale solar, approximately 65 \nto 85 MW of DG solar additions, up to 400 MW of additional wind energy, and up to 500 MWh of \nnew energy storage, by 2030 or sooner.  \nThe 2025 Plan will result in the Company providing a transition to a coal-free power supply \nand, along with the cleaner natural gas support identified above, will include up to an additional \n400 MW of wind energy, at least 100 MW of enhanced industrial demand response with economic \ncurtailments, and 100 MW of energy storage by 2035. The 2025 Plan calls for continued \noperations at the HREC and will explore additional biomass investments as a future solid fuel \nalternative. This exploration will be based on the outcome of the Commission proceeding to \ndevelop a Life-Cycle Analysis (“LCA”) for biomass to be utilized as a carbon-free fuel source in \ncompliance with the CFS and ongoing consultation with Tribal Nations and other stakeholders. \nThis IRP represents an iterative planning approach and the 2025 Plan, if approved, will deliver an \nannual energy portfolio that is 80 percent carbon-free by 2030 and pave the path to deliver 90 \npercent carbon-free energy by 2035. Furthermore, the 2025 Plan results in 95 percent carbon \nreductions from 2005 levels.  \nThe pursuit of cleaner technologies and evolution are paramount as we move forward. While \nnot all technology is commercially available for full grid deployment at this time, the Company \nmaintains its commitment to work with customers to support ongoing development of carbon \nminimizing alternatives. In the 2025 Plan, the Company has proposed a research and \nMinnesota Power’s 2025-2039 Integrated Resource Plan Page 25 \nSection II. 2025 Resource Plan Summary approved utility planning framework. Supported by the information and analysis in the appendices \nof this IRP, the actions outlined in the following sections identify both short- and long-term steps \nthat will help Minnesota Power continue to meet customer needs near term (over the next five \nyears) and be poised to deliver safe and reliable service to customers for many years to come. \nShort-Term Action Plan (2025 through 2030)  \nMinnesota Power’s short-term action plan during the five-year period of 2025 through 2030 \nis comprised of steps that will immediately reduce carbon emissions in the near term and continue \nthe addition of carbon-free energy renewables, conservation, and other demand side resources \nto the Company’s resource portfolio. The specific strategic and necessary actions to achieve \nthese steps include: \n Complete the 2021 IRP actions already in progress, including finalizing the Company’s \nimplementation plan for 400 MW of new wind energy by 2028 and completing the \nimplementation of the Regal Solar Project and the Boswell Solar Project, which will result \nin an approximately 200 MW of additional utility-scale solar resources. The Company will \nalso bring forward a filing outlining the Company’s plan for up to 500 MWh of new energy \nstorage in 2026 and progress on IDP non-wires alternatives.  \n Maximize demand side management and customer options by continuing the Company’s \nECO and energy efficiency programs and creating the necessary tariff mechanisms to \nacquire at least 100 MW of new long-term demand response capacity by 2028 that \nincludes an annual energy curtailment requirement. The Company will also work to \ncomplete the addition of 65 to 85 MW of new DG solar resources and implement an EV \nmulti-dwelling unit (“MDU”) program to further support customers’ electrification needs. \n Add new renewable energy to the Company’s portfolio by releasing an RFP for 400 MW \nof additional wind energy and 100 MW of energy storage for implementation by 2035. \n Advance the Company’s plan to cease coal at BEC3 by 2030 by beginning the \nengineering and acquisition of materials required for a natural gas refuel of the unit. \nPending the outcome of state and federal regulatory processes and economic \nevaluations related to biomass as a net carbon-free resource, Minnesota Power will \nconduct additional investigation into the economic prospects of co-firing biomass as part \nof the refuel plan at BEC. The Company will cease coal at BEC3 once new gas refuel \ncapability is in service. This refueling will result in an immediate carbon emissions \nreduction while supporting reliability in the region and continuing to provide economic \nbenefits for the local host community. \n In order to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Section 111(d) \ncarbon regulations, begin development and engineering required for at least a 40 percent \nnatural gas capability for BEC4, in coordination with WPPI Energy.  \n Continue operations at HREC to support regional reliability needs and ensure all \nenvironmental requirements are met for this renewable facility.  \n Work with customers to integrate emerging clean firm technology with a proposal \nrequesting $30 million to pursue R&D projects that will be rider recoverable. \nLong-Term Action Plan (2030 through 2039) \nMinnesota Power will focus its long-term action plan on a strategy to further reduce carbon \nemissions in its portfolio and reshape its generation mix after it ceases utilizing coal. This long-\nterm strategy will continue resource diversification and position Minnesota Power to be able to \nMinnesota Power’s 2025-2039 Integrated Resource Plan Page 68 \nSection V. 2025 Plan Development Since 2015, through operational optimization and capital investments, the minimum dispatch level \non BEC3 and BEC4 have been reduced. Since the last IRP, Minnesota Power implemented a \nproject at BEC3 that reduced the minimum dispatch level from 175 MW down to 75 MW. These \nactions to improve the flexibility of the fleet have opened new opportunities for utilizing existing \nassets at BEC3 to co-locate solar. Minnesota Power is requesting approval from the Commission \nto add 85 MW of solar that will share interconnection service with BEC3, requiring the unit to \ndecrease generation during the day to make room for solar energy to go onto the grid. This is a \ngreat example of Minnesota Power’s foresight to invest in improving flexibility, creating an \nopportunity to add cost effective solar to meet the CFS, and directly reducing carbon emissions \nby allowing for additional renewable energy to flow onto the system.  \nIn the IRP analysis, Minnesota Power screened two alternative fuel options at BEC3 to \ncontinue producing energy after ceasing coal operations by 2030, along with a retirement \nscenario. This included refueling the boiler with 100 percent natural gas or co-firing with biomass \nand natural gas. Both refueling alternatives would require a capital investment to install the natural \ngas capability or retrofit the existing coal handling system to handle biomass. The capital \ninvestment for the biomass option also includes costs for a biomass palletization facility on site \nthat would take regional biomass and convert it to pellets that can be used in the boiler. The 100 \npercent gas refuel option also included a reduction in O&M due to fewer staff needed to operate \na natural gas fired steam unit. A concern with refuel is that the large peaking asset would have \nlong lead time startup operations in comparison to modern combustion turbines, although the \nCompany believes that is manageable with the recommendation to refuel one BEC unit on 100 \npercent natural gas in the 2025 Plan. The need for flexible and dispatchable generation will \ncontinue to be evaluated in future IRPs as Minnesota Power prepares to meet the CFS. \nThe Capacity Expansion Analysis demonstrates that refueling BEC3 is a least cost option for \ncustomers versus retirement and replacing BEC3 with new gas generation. Furthermore, with \nMinnesota Power showing a growing capacity need with ceasing coal operations and in the +1100 \nMW Growth Scenario, BEC3 cannot be retired prior to replacement generation with similar \noperational characteristics being brought online. With a commitment to cease coal by 2030, it \nwould be challenging or impossible to have replacement generation online given the Company’s \nrecent experience with permitting the NTEC project. Refueling by co-firing with biomass and \nnatural gas shows economic promise, especially if biomass receives net carbon-free treatment \nthrough a life-cycle analysis to qualify for the PTC and CFS. Unfortunately, the requirements for \nperforming a life-cycle analysis on biomass have not been finalized at the federal and state level, \ncreating uncertainty on the viability of biomass in the future. \nThere are regional environmental benefits accompanying ceasing coal operation and \nrefueling BEC3 with natural gas. With coal no longer needed to operate BEC3, there will be less \ncoal handling occurring onsite, along with less rail cars delivering coal to the facility. The trickle-\ndown impact to operations will also affect ash handling, where the transportation activities and \nstorage of ash will cease. Although there are environmental benefits to the reduced coal and ash \nhandling, the jobs associated with these activities will be negatively impacted. Minnesota Power \nwill work with any affected employees and the union on a transition plan if the refueling of BEC3 \nwith natural gas is approved. \nFor the reasons stated above, Minnesota Power is recommending in the 2025 Plan additional \ninvestigation, including submitting a life-cycle analysis for biomass to be utilized as a net-carbon \nfree source to meet the Minnesota CFS. If net-carbon free status is achieved for biomass and this \nrefuel option continues to show economic benefits for customers, Minnesota Power will submit \nnecessary permitting to advance the ability to co-fire biomass at BEC3. In the short-term action \nplan, the 2025 Plan recommends the Company begin engineering and acquisition of necessary \nMinnesota Power’s 2025-2039 Integrated Resource Plan Page 69 \nSection V. 2025 Plan Development materials for a 100 percent natural gas refuel of BEC3. Note that this 100 percent natural gas \nrefuel recommendation meets the requirements of the EPA’s Section 111(d) carbon regulations. \nAn outcome of the 2021 IRP was a requirement for Minnesota Power to evaluate the \nconversion of BEC3 to a synchronous condenser upon retirement. A study was performed to \ndetermine the feasibility of converting BEC3 to a synchronous condenser, for both seasonal \noperation and following unit retirement. The study found it is technically feasible to convert the \nunit to synchronous condenser operation. However, the length of time needed to switch between \ngenerating and synchronous condenser operating modes makes conversion infeasible until unit \nretirement. Because the 2025 Plan includes a BEC3 refuel with natural gas, Minnesota Power \nrecommends taking no action on converting BEC3 to a synchronous condenser and will continue \nto consider the option in future IRPs. Appendix F contains additional information on the \nsynchronous condenser conversion study.  \nBEC4 \nBEC4 will be one of the last baseload operating units in northern Minnesota after BEC3 \nceases coal operations in 2030. As approved in the 2021 IRP, the Company continues to be \ncommitted to ceasing coal-fired operations for its customers in 2035. Like BEC3, BEC4 is an \neconomic capacity and energy resource for customers and is well controlled for emissions. The \nCompany continues to take actions as needed to prepare a transition to economic dispatch in a \nsimilar manner as BEC3 operates today.  Action can be taken if it is economical for customers \nand regional reliability of the system can be maintained with no dispatchable generation online in \nnorthern Minnesota. BEC4 is jointly owned with WPPI Energy and any changes will be \ncoordinated with this co-owner, including moving to economic dispatch, remission, or retirement. \nMinnesota Power will continue to work closely with its partner on future plans at BEC4. \nThe IRP analysis evaluated multiple refuel options and retirement at the 2035 cease coal \ndate for BEC4. The refuel options evaluated are a 40 percent natural gas refuel by 2030 or co-\nfiring with biomass and natural gas by 2035. Per the EPA Section 111(d) carbon regulation \nrequirements, BEC4 cannot continue to operate exclusively on coal through 2035 and additional \naction is required for Section 111(d) compliance. One option per the EPA regulation is to refuel \nBEC4 to 40 percent natural gas by 2030. Given the demonstrated need for capacity and energy \nin 2030, and the inability to feasibly add new generation in this timeframe, Minnesota Power is \nrecommending in the 2025 Plan to take action at BEC4 to prepare the unit for compliance with \nSection 111(d) by starting the engineering and acquisition of necessary materials for a 40 percent \nnatural gas refuel by 2030. The Company is monitoring litigation of the final Section 111 rules, \nwhich is proceeding in federal court. Outcomes from ongoing litigation may impact both the timing \nof rule effectiveness and the ultimate compliance obligations required by the rule. If this rule is \nvacated through legal proceedings, remanded by the new federal administration, or replaced with \na new federal carbon regulation, Minnesota Power will re-evaluate this recommendation and \nprovide an update in the next IRP. \nIn the 2021 IRP, the Commission ordered Minnesota Power in its next IRP to “…continue to \nevaluate additional transmission system reliability mitigations needed to maintain the option of \nretiring the Boswell facility entirely, including unit 4, by no later than 2030.”  Minnesota Power \ncontinues to make progress on transmission system upgrades to strengthen the system for \nconsidering a BEC retirement. Please refer to Appendix F for further discussions on the significant \nprojects that are in progress. The limiting constraint on potentially removing BEC4 as early as \n2030 is a power supply reliability concern along with the infeasibility to add new generation in that \ntimeframe to replace such a large component of capacity and dispatchable energy for customers. \nTherefore, this IRP studied an earliest retirement date for customers of 2035 for BEC4.  \nATTACHMENT CL S-2 \nExcerpt from ALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K  (February 13, \n2025) \nUnited States\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nForm 10-K\n(Mark One)\n ☒ Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n         For the year ended December 31, 2024  \n☐ Transition Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nFor the transition period from ______________ to ______________\nCommission File Number 1-3548\nALLETE, Inc.\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)\nMinnesota  41-0418150\n(State or other jurisdiction of incorporation or or ganization)  (I.R.S.

I NTRODUCTION  1 \nQ. Would you state your name, occupation and business address?  2 \nA. My name is  C raig Addonizio. I am employed as a Public Utilities Analyst Coordinator  by 3 \nthe Minnesota Department of Commerce, Division of Energy Resources ( DOC ). My 4 \nbusiness address is 85 7th Place East, Suite 280, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101 -2198.  5 \n 6 \nQ. Are you the same Craig Addonizio who previously filed direct testimony in this 7 \nproceeding?  8 \nA. Yes. 9 \n 10 \nQ. What is the purpose of your  s urrebuttal  testimony?  11 \nA. In my surrebuttal testimony, I will respond to the rebuttal testimony of various 12 \nwitnesses from ALLETE, Inc.  (“ALLETE,” d/b/a Minnesota Power, or the “Company”) , 13 \nGlobal Infrastructure Management, LLC (d/b/a “ Global Infrastructure Partners, ” or 14 \n“GIP”), and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( “CPP Investments ”) (together, the  15 \n”Partners”)  (together with Minnesota Power, the “ Petitioners ”). 16 \n I address the following topics:  17 \n• ALLETE’s asserted need for new equity capital over coming years;  18 \n• The asserted public interest benefits of the Acquisition, including improved 19 \naccess to capital for ALLETE and access to the Partners’ expertise; and  20 \n• The potential for the Acquisition to cause ALLETE’s cost of capital to increase as a 21 \nresult of financing actions the Partners’ may take post -Acquisition.  22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 2 II. ASSERTED NE ED FOR CAPITAL  1 \nQ. Please briefly summarize the portion of your direct testimony regarding ALLETE’s 2 \nstated need for capital.  3 \nA. In my direct testimony, I note d that the Company had produced different capital 4 \nexpenditure forecasts that resulted in significantly different forecasted needs for equity 5 \nissuances over coming five years. In particular, I noted that in his direct testimony, 6 \nMinnesota Power Witness Joshua Taran cited the capital expenditure forecasts provided 7 \nin the Company’s annual capital structure filings and described a need to issue 8 \napproximately $1 billion of new equity  in the coming years . In contrast, per the Proxy 9 \nStatement, ALLETE’s Board of Directors relied on a different capital forecast that pointed 10 \nto a need to issue [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET BEGINS  HIGHLY 11 \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET ENDS]  over the same period.1 I also noted that ALLETE’s 12 \ncapital structure forecasts have tended to overestimate its future capital spending.  13 \nFinally, I  noted that ALLETE’s Proxy Statement described the higher of these two 14 \nestimates as being “within reasonable limits for ALLETE ,” which I concluded meant that 15 \nlower of these two estimates must therefore be well under reasonable limits for 16 \nALLETE.2  17 \n \n1 Ex.

Did any Petitioner witnesses respond to your analysis of ALLETE’s forecasted need for 1 \nequity?  2 \nA. Yes. Mr. Taran criticized my analysis for failing to recognize certain nuances related to 3 \nthe non- regulated capital forecasts included in Minnesota Power’s capital structure 4 \npetitions.  He also criticized my testimony for failing to recognize that a note in ALLETE’s 5 \n2024 SEC Form 10 -K about the capital forecast presented in that document applies to 6 \nthe forecasts presented in Minnesota Power’s capital structure petitions, despite the 7 \nfact that the forecasts are different and Company does not include any similar notes in 8 \nits capital structure petitions.  9 \n  10 \nQ. Do you agree with Mr. Taran’s criticisms?  11 \nA. I agree that Mr. Taran’s explanation of the budget variances observed in the Company’s 12 \ncapital structure petitions for its non- regulated capital expenditures is reasonable. 13 \nHowever, his testimony amounts to a good explanation of why it is reasonable for those 14 \nforecasts to be intentionally overstated. As Mr. Taran pointed out, ALLETE’s non - 15 \nregulated capital expenditures are designed to be flexible,  and the Company structures 16 \nits capital structure petitions and budgets to allow for non- regulated spending that has a 17 \nlow probability of actually occurring.  18 \n  I not e that ALLETE’s Proxy Statement forecast includes [TRADE SECRET DATA 19 \nBEGINS  TRADE SECRET ENDS]  of these flexible, non-regulated capital 20 \nexpenditures over the period 202 4-2028, much higher than the actual expenditures over 21 \nthe past five years of [TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS  TRADE SECRET DATA 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 4 ENDS] . As Mr. Taran pointed out, the se  projects are planned such that they can easily 1 \ndelayed or abandoned  if capital is not available,3 supporting my conclusion that the 2 \nCompany’s need for new equity could easily be substantially less than the Proxy 3 \nStatement forecast indicates.  4 \n  With  respect to Mr. Taran’s other criticism of my analysis – that I relied on 5 \ncapital forecasts that omit capital projects that the Company is still evaluating but may 6 \nbe added in the future – I note that I relied on the same forecast  he himself presented 7 \nand relied on in his direct testimony ( the Company’s forecast from its 2024 capital 8 \nstructure petition).   9 \n 10 \nQ. In your direct testimony, did you discuss any ways ALLETE might be able to reasonably 11 \nreduce its capital needs?  12 \nA. Yes. I suggested that Minnesota Power could replace one or more of the win d or solar 13 \nprojects that it plans to own with power purchase agreements (PPAs). As an example , I 14 \nnoted that Minnesota Power’s capital plan includes [TRADE SECRET DATA BEGINS  15 \n 16 \n 17 \n 18 \n4 TRADE SECRET DATA ENDS]   19 \n \n3 Ex.

DOC -__ at 39 (Addonizio Direct).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 5   I  also suggested that other utilities could take over Minnesota Power’s interest in 1 \none or more transmission projects , or that projects could be delayed if necessary,  during 2 \nsignificant economic downturns.  3 \n 4 \nQ. Did any Petitioner witnesses respond to  y our suggestion  regarding PPAs ?  5 \nA. Yes. Mi nnesota Power witness Jeffery Scissons stated “[i]f Minnesota Power did not 6 \nparticipate in resource acquisition requests for proposals (“RFPs”) and resigned its 7 \ncustomers to solely signing power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) as Witness Addonizio 8 \nrecommends reducing  the capital plan, this creates other risks.”5 9 \n  Mr.  Taran stated that, when acquiring a new wind or solar resource, limiting the 10 \nrequest for proposals (“RFP”) for the resource to only PPAs, and not allowing Minnesota 11 \nPower to propose a self -build project, would be “anti -competitive and limit the 12 \nCompany’s ability to pursue the lowest cost resource additions to serve its customers.” 13 \nHe also stated that my “proposal to only pursue PPAs is an over- simplification and 14 \nwould very likely lead to increased customer costs and reduced reliability.”  Mr. Taran 15 \nalso asserted that the Company’s capital plan already assumes that some resource 16 \nadditions will be PPAs, and as an example stated that the Company’s plan assumes only 17 \none of the two 200 MW wind farms I mentioned be owned by Minnesota Power.6 18 \n \n5 Ex. MP- __ at 14 -15 (Scissons Rebuttal).  \n6 Ex. MP- __ at 16 (Taran Rebuttal).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 6   J onathan Bram of GIP provided some data showing that PPA costs have been 1 \nincreasing and asserted that requiring Company to rely on the market for PPAs would 2 \nlikely not be cost effective.7 3 \n    4 \nQ. How do you respond?  5 \nA. Mr. Scissons’ claim is a  s ignificant  mischaracterization of my testimony. I did not suggest 6 \nthat Minnesota Power acquire all of its resources via PPAs. Rather, I suggested 7 \nconverting one or two planned projects from Minnesota Power -owned to PPAs.  8 \n  Wh ile Mr. Bram provided evidence that PPA costs are rising, he offered no 9 \nevidence that the cost of building wind and solar resources is not following the same 10 \ntrend . Thus both his and Mr. Taran’s claims about PPAs increasing costs unsupported, as 11 \nare Mr. Taran’s claims about threats to reliability.  12 \n  In a ddition, both Mr. Bram and Mr. Quackenbush recognize in their testimonies  13 \nthat PPAs are often reasonable options  for resource acquisitions and reasonable 14 \nadditions to portfolio or resources .8 I also note that in Docket No. E015/M- 18-545, 15 \nMinnesota Power conducted an RFP for wind and did not bid a self- build option, so 16 \ndoing so is not unusual or “anti -competitive.”  17 \n  Mor eover, the specific example Mr. Taran cites about the Company currently 18 \npursuing 200 MW of owned wind resources and 200 MW of wind PPA resources appears 19 \nto be false. As I noted in my direct testimony, the Company’s capital plan [TRADE 20 \n \n7 Ex. MP- __ at 18 (Bram Rebuttal).  \n8 Ex. MP- __ at 17 (Bram Direct) and Ex.

Did any Petitioner witnesses respond to your suggestion about allowing other utilities 1 \nto take over Minnesota Power’s interest in one or more of its large transmission 2 \nprojects?  3 \nA. Yes. Both M r. Taran and Mr. Scisson s claimed, without explanation or support, that 4 \nallowing other utilities to take over the Company’s interest in transmission projects 5 \nwould threaten reliability , and both made other confusing, unsupported statements 6 \nabout potential negative effects that may result if the Company sells or gives up its 7 \nownership stake.12  8 \n 9 \nQ. How do you respond?  10 \nA. A presentation made to ALLETE’s Board of Directors on January 24, 2024 pro vided in 11 \ndiscovery indicates that [HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET BEGINS  12 \n 13 \n 14 \n.13  15 \n 16 \nits  HIGHLY 17 \nCONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET ENDS]   18 \n  Thus,  I continue to conclude that Minnesota Power converting one or two 19 \nplanned resource acquisitions from Minnesota Power -owned to PPAs, or selling its 20 \n \n12 Ex.

Did any Petitioner witnesses comment on your suggestion  t hat capital projects could 4 \nbe reevaluated or delayed in certain situation?  5 \nA. Yes. Mr. Scissons disagreed with my te stimony that during a broad- based economic 6 \ndownturn, it may be reasonable to reevaluate the need for and timing of planned 7 \ncapital projects. Mr. Scissons stated that due to the nature of the utility business, “a 8 \nutility cannot simply turn on and off capital spend.”14 9 \n 10 \nQ. Do you agree?  11 \nA. I agree that some large, long -t erm capital projects can only be canceled or delayed at a 12 \nsignificant cost, and that often it would not be reasonable or prudent to do so. 13 \nHowever, that is not true for all projects. Mr. Scissons  himself makes multiple references 14 \nto delaying or altering capital projects in response to capital constraints.

Please briefly summarize the conclusions you reached in your direct testimony about 2 \nthe Acquisition' s likely impact on ALLETE’s access to capital.  3 \nA. I concluded that the Acquisition was unlikely to improve ALLETE’s access to capital, and 4 \nthat many of the Petitioners’ stated concerns about ALLETE’s access to capital  and the 5 \npotential benefits of the Acquisition were unsupported and contrary to evidence and 6 \ntheory.  These concerns were primarily covered in the direct testimony of Minnesota 7 \nPower witness John Quackenbush, who discussed the risks of a company being forced to 8 \nissue new equity at a time when it  believes its  stock is trading at a price below its true 9 \nvalue,  a situation Mr. Quackenbush referred to as a “temporary value disruption.”  In 10 \nshort, Mr. Quackenbush believes that the C ompany can recognize when its stock price is 11 \n“too low,” and in the past has been able to avoid issuing equity at those times. 12 \nHowever, going forward, the Company is concerned that its capital needs will not allow 13 \nit to defer equity issuances until its stock is being valued correctly by the market.  14 \n  I, ho wever, believe the stock market is more efficient than Mr. Quackenbush 15 \ngives it credit for, and that most of the time s when a company defer s an equity issuance 16 \nbased on a belief that its stock is undervalued and likely to rebound in the near future, it 17 \nis wrong. Financial theory and empirical evidence strongly suggest that it is exceedingly 18 \ndifficult to identify and take advantage of such “temporary value disruptions.”    19 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 13 Q. P lease explain.  1 \nA. If it were easy to tell when a stock is experiencing a “temporary value disruption”  a nd to 2 \npredict when the stock’s price is going to rebound,  investors would buy  the stock while 3 \npriced “too low” and hold it until it was fairly valued. By buying those underpriced 4 \nstocks and holding them while they recovered their value, t hose active investors would, 5 \nover time, earn investment returns greater than the returns offered by passive 6 \ninvestment strategies like S&P 500 Index funds.  7 \n  Ho wever, as I described in my direct testimony,  exceedingly few investors 8 \noutperform passive benchmarks like the S&P 500  Index. Of those that do, it is virtually 9 \nimpossible to tell whether they are skilled investors or just lucky.22 That is because the 10 \nstock market is very efficient,  such that even if or when “temporary value disruptions” 11 \noccur, they are nearly impossible to recogniz e. 12 \n  Giv en that most professional investors cannot recognize and take advantage of 13 \n“temporary value disruptions,” there is little or no reason to believe corporate financial 14 \nmanagers can, either. It is much more likely than not when a company believes its stock 15 \nis underpriced and expects it rebound , the company is incorrect.  16 \n 17 \nQ. Please summarize the Petitioners’ responses to your direct testimony on this topic.  18 \nA. Mr. Quackenbush  a nd Mr. Scissons assert that I misunderstand how prices are 19 \ndetermined in the stock market and that I overstate the efficiency of the stock market, 20 \nand as a result, underestimate the risks that would be associated with Minnesota Power 21 \n \n22 “In the end, it is likely that margin of superiority that any professional manager can add is so slight that the \nstatistician will not easily be able to detect it.” Z vi Bodie  et al. , INVESTMENTS  at 375 ( 8th ed. 2009).   \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 14 raisin g the large amount of new equity  it will need  over the next several years  from the 1 \npublic equity market.  2 \n  In his rebuttal testimony, Mr. Quackenbush reiterated his concern that stock 3 \nprices often deviate from fundamentals, and such distortions can persist for extended 4 \nperiods. He stated that investors look for these distortions and can be rewarded for 5 \nfinding them because it can lead to outperformance. He also stated that he had a 6 \nsuccessful track record of identifying such instances while he was an equity analyst.23 7 \n 8 \nQ. How do you respond?  9 \nA. As I described in my direct testimony, the overwhelming majority of active investors 10 \nunderperform the market because they are unable to identify these price distortions.24 11 \nHowever, just as with his direct testimony, Mr. Quackenbush provided no objective 12 \nevidence or analysis to support his claims. He also did not acknowledge the SPIVA report 13 \nI cited showing how few investors outperform their benchmarks.  14 \n 15 \nQ. What specifically did Mr.  S cissons say about your direct testimony?  16 \nA. Mr. Scissons claimed that my direct testimony  m isrepresented the Efficient Market 17 \nHypothesis  (“EMH”) stating that it is not well accepted and not completely true.25 18 \n \n23 Ex. MP- __ at 15 (Quackenbush Rebuttal).  \n24 Ex. DOC -__ at 33 (Addonizio Direct).  \n25 Ex. MP- __ at 17 (Scissons Rebuttal). I note that Mr. Scissons also criticized me for not having recently read the \npaper published in 1970 introducing the Efficient Market Hypothesis despite the fact that it is readily available. \nHowever,  I identified that paper in response to an information request from the Company specifically asking me to \niden tify the “source of the “accepted financial theory” and  the “primary proponent of this theory.” However, \nbecause I did not rely on this paper, I also noted that the theory is discussed in numerous other publications and \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 15 Q. H ow do you respond?  1 \nA. EMH posits simply that market prices are informationally efficient, or, in other words, 2 \nreflect all available information . The main prediction of EMH is that future stock price 3 \nmovements are unpredictable because they will result only from the introduction of 4 \nnew, previously unknown information.26 This suggests that when corporate financial 5 \nmanagers believe it is prudent to wait to issue equity because their company’s stock 6 \nprice is going to go up, they are essentially attempting to predict the unpredictable.  7 \n  The re is a substantial body of evidence that suggests stock price movements are 8 \nlargely, unpredictable. The SPIVA report I cite in my direct testimony is just one 9 \nexample.27 In response to an information request from Minnesota Power, I cited five 10 \nmore sources  that also support the prediction that stock prices are unpredictable.28 For 11 \nexample, the renowned investment manager David Swenson, in describing the 12 \n“difficulties of managing investment portfolios to exploit asset mispricings,” wrote that 13 \nactive investors “face intensely competitive environments in which the majority of 14 \nparticipants fail. The efficiency of marketable security pricing poses formidable hurdles 15 \nto investors pursuing active management strategies.”29 Even Richard Thaler, the 16 \nprominent economist and EMH skeptic Mr. Scissons referenced in his rebuttal 17 \n \ncited a popular investment finance textbook that discusses the theory and that I did review. In response to a \ndifferent information request from the Company, I also cited five more finance textbooks that support  my assertion \nthat markets are generally very efficient and offered to provide photocopies of the relevant chapters on request.  \n26 Ex.

Did Petitioner witnesses comment on any other parts of your testimony related to 7 \nrisks of being a publicly traded company?  8 \nA. Yes. Th e Petitioner  witnesses generally believe that my direct testimony  underestimate s 9 \nthe risks of trying to raise the amount of equity ALLETE will need to raise, relative to its 10 \nsize, from the public equity markets. Mr. Taran, for example, stated that ALLETE has a 11 \n“high likelihood” of facing a significant market disruption, and therefore attempting to 12 \nissue the amount of equity Minnesota Power will need over the next five years creates 13 \nan “enormous” amount of risk, so much so that it would not be “responsible for the 14 \nCompany to move forward” as a publicly traded company.31  15 \n  Mr.  Scissons highlighted the risk of ALLETE being forced to issue shares below 16 \nbook value  during a significant downturn and stated that ALLETE’s Board carefully 17 \nconsidered these risks and “identified that the best solution was an acquisition by the 18 \nPartners.”32  19 \n 20 \n \n30 Richard Thaler, M ISBEHAVING  at 251 (2015).  \n31 Ex. MP- __ at 18 -19 (Taran Rebuttal).  \n32 Ex MP -__ at 16  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 17 Q. H ow do you respond?  1 \nA. B ased on the strong language Mr. Scissons and Mr. T aran use to describe the risk s, they 2 \nseem to think that if ALLETE’s equity investors are unable to sell their shares to the 3 \nPartner’s for $67 each, they will face a very high risk of losing substantial amounts of 4 \nwealth during a market disruption.  But their language is not consistent with the fact 5 \nthat prior to accepting the Partners ’ offer of $67 per share, ALLETE’s board rejected an 6 \noffer of $64 per share.33 To the extent that is indicative of the Board’s view of the 7 \ndownside risks of ALLETE remaining a publicly traded company, it suggests a much lower 8 \nlevel of risk than Minnesota Power’s  witnesses represent in their testimony.  In other 9 \nwords, the fact that ALLETE’s board rejected an offer of $64 per share but accepted an 10 \noffer of $67 per share indicates that it valued the benefit of eliminating its exposure to 11 \nthe volatility and risk of the public equity market  at $3 per share or less. That small 12 \ndifferential is incongruent with Mr. Taran’s descriptions of that risk.  13 \n  Mo re generally, both Mr. Taran and Mr. Scissons seem to assume that ALLETE’s 14 \nattempt to transition to a privately held company was virtually guaranteed to be 15 \nsuccessful, and there was little to no chance the Company would be reliant on the public 16 \nequity market for its capital needs. But there was always a very real chance that ALLETE 17 \nwould not be able to find a buyer and would remain reliant on the public equity market 18 \nfor its equity capital needs. If the risks of remaining public were as great as Mr. Taran 19 \nand Mr. Scissons suggest, such that it is “irresponsible” for ALLETE to move forward as a 20 \npublicly -traded company, it w as irresponsible for ALLETE to put itself in a position in 21 \n \n33 Ex. MP- __, Attachment L at 50 -51 (Petition).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 18 which it was reliant on a highly uncertain search for a private buyer, with no back -u p 1 \nplan, to avoid the risks . 2 \n 3 \nQ. Did you discuss steps ALLETE could potentially take to navigate some of those risks 4 \nshould they arise?  5 \nA. Yes. I n addition to potentially delaying capital projects, as described above, I suggested 6 \nthat ALLETE could temporarily rely on alternative forms of financing during acute market 7 \ndisruptions.34 I specifically referenced the possible use of ALLETE’s credit facility to 8 \nprovide temporary liquidity.  9 \n 10 \nQ. Did any Petitioner witnesses respond to that suggestion?  11 \nA. Yes. Mr. Taran stated that doing so would risk leaving the Company with no cushion for 12 \nfurther adverse conditions, would pressure the Company’s credit rating, and would 13 \nharm its ability to carry the capital structure authorized by the Commission.35 Mr. 14 \nQuackenbush agreed that sometimes delaying an equity issuance is the right move for a 15 \ncompany and that use of the credit facility to do so is a possibility. However, he also 16 \nexpressed similar concerns as Mr. Taran.36  17 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 \n \n34 Ex. DOC -__ at 35 (Addonizio Direct).  \n35 Ex. MP- __ at (Taran Direct).  \n36 Ex.

Both Mr. Taran and Mr. Quackenbush raise reasonable concerns about the potential 2 \noverreliance on a credit facility. However, when I suggested the temporary use of 3 \nALLETE’s credit facility during a significant market disruption, I did not mean to suggest 4 \nusing it for several months or longer. I would expect any draws on the credit facility to 5 \nbe refinanced as quickly as reasonably feasible , either with equity if possible, or 6 \ntemporarily with a longer term (though still relatively short -term) debt financing  to be 7 \nreplaced with equity in the future.  8 \n 9 \nQ. What about their stated concerns about staying within capital structure limits 10 \napproved by the Commission?  11 \nA. T he Commission ty pically sets capital structure limits with wide contingency ranges, in 12 \nlarge part to provide utilities with flexibility to handle changing economic conditions. 13 \nThe Commission’s Order in the Company’s most recent capital structure filing would 14 \nallow the Company to issue several hundred million dollars’ worth of debt in addition to 15 \nthe planned debt issuances.37 Even if this normal amount of latitude was not sufficient, 16 \nthe Company could always file a new capital structure filing with a request for a 17 \ntemporarily increased percentage of debt.  18 \n 19 \n \n37 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power Under Minnesota Statutes 216B.49 for Approval  \nof its Capital Structure and Authorization to Issue Securities , MPUC Docket No. E -015/S- 24-108, ORDER  (Aug. 27, \n2024).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 20 Q. T o the extent it is not possible to delay or postpone capital projects, would the 1 \nCompany likely be able to raise the capital it need s during a downturn?  2 \nA. As Mr. Taran described in his rebuttal testimony,  i ssuing equity when ALLETE’s stock 3 \nprice is “very low” would be harmful to the Company’s existing shareholders, and that 4 \ndoing so would not be “responsible.”38 But with this statement, Mr. Taran seems to 5 \nadmit that ALLETE could issue equity in those circumstances, it just would not want to. 6 \nThis consistent with the point I made in my direct testimony that what the Company 7 \ndescribes as a potential lack of access  to capital is really more of a lack of willingness to 8 \nuse its access to capital.39 9 \n  I ag ree with Mr. Taran  that utility boards have responsibilities to their 10 \nshareholders, but they also have obligations to their customers to make needed 11 \ninvestments.  ALLETE’s Board and its investors no doubt understand the risks that come 12 \nwith these responsibilities, and are compensated for them with a reasonable 13 \nopportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments. But t hat return is not 14 \nguaranteed.  15 \n  Mr.  Taran, Mr. Scissons, and Mr. Quackenbush all discuss the risks to ratepayers 16 \nassociated with dilutive equity issuances, but there are also risks associated with relying 17 \non only two investors for all of ALLETE’s equity needs.  As I described in my direct 18 \ntestimony, the Partners may, for any number of reasons, decide that they have better 19 \ninvestment opportunities elsewhere.  I remain concerned about what might happen to 20 \n \n38 Ex. MP- __ at 18 (Taran Rebuttal).  \n39 Ex. DOC -__ at 36 (Addonizio Direct).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 21 ALLETE’s access to capital if that were to happen and skeptical about the possibility of 1 \nALLETE issuing preferred shares.40  2 \n 3 \nQ. Did any Petitioner witnesses address that specific concern?  4 \nA. Yes. Minnesota Power witness Ellen Lapson s tated that my concern about the Partners 5 \nnot investing in ALLETE is not reasonable, as “the Partners will be motivated to make 6 \nongoing equity investments in the Company if there is a reasonable opportunity for 7 \nMinnesota Power to earn returns consistent with companies of comparable risk.”41 8 \nWhile I agree that the Partners would likely not starve Minnesota Power for capital and 9 \ndestroy the value of their investment, it is possible that they might not be willing to 10 \nprovide the full amount Minnesota Power needs , and cause the utility to reduce its 11 \ncapital plans in ways that are not optimal.  12 \n  Ms.  Lapson also stated that the concerns  raised in my direct testimony  about 13 \npreferred equity were the result of being “misinformed.” She claimed that my testimony  14 \nfalsely claimed that that preferred equity is not a form of equity,  and she denied that 15 \npreferred equity has bond- like qualities.42  16 \n \n40 Ex.

MP- __ at 6 (Lapson Rebuttal).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 22 Q. H ow do you respond . 1 \nA. My direct testimony did not say that preferred equity is not equity. My testimony stated 2 \nthat preferred equity is not common equity , which is true. And my description of 3 \npreferred stock as having bond -like qualities should not be controversial as it is 4 \nconsistent with the description of preferred equity found in numerous finance 5 \ntextbook s. For example:  6 \nPreferred stock has features similar to both equity and 7 \ndebt. Like a bond, it promises to pay its holder a fixed 8 \namount of income each year. In this sense preferred stock 9 \nis similar to an infinite -maturity bond, that is, a perpetuity. 10 \nIt also resembles a bond in that it does not convey voting 11 \npower regarding management of the firm.43 12 \n  13 \nQ. Did the Partners offer any additional commitments to alleviate your concerns about a 14 \npotential lack of access to capital?  15 \nA. Yes. The Partners committed to provide Minnesota Power equity financing, including 16 \nbut not limited to equity infusion, deferral or reinvestment of dividends, or a 17 \ncombination of both, in an amount equal to the equity financing required to fund 18 \nMinnesota Power’s five -year capital plan as reflected in its February 2025 10 -K Filing.44  19 \n \n43 Zvi Bodie et al., I NVESTMENTS  at 37 (8th ed. 2009).  \n44 Ex.

I appreciate the effort to address one of my concerns, but I remain concerned about the 2 \nenforceability of this commitment. It is unclear how the Commission could enforce this 3 \ncommitment if the Partners do not fulfill it.  4 \n 5 \nQ. What are your conclusions about ALLETE’s capital needs and ability to fund those 6 \nneeds as a publicly traded company?  7 \nA. I understand that ALLETE’s planned capital expenditures over the next several years are 8 \nmuch greater than its actual capital expenditures over the past several years . I also 9 \nunderstand that as a result, its need for new debt and equity is large compared to its 10 \nhistorical needs . Nonetheless,  I continue to conclude that ALLETE will have  likely  11 \nadequate access to capital to fund its planned expenditures as a publicly traded 12 \ncompany. As noted above, the Company stated that even the high estimates of its 13 \nequity needs are “within reasonable limits” for ALLETE, and the Company has since 14 \nproduced lower estimates . 15 \n  Wh ile remaining a public company may pose some risks to ALLETE’s existing 16 \nshareholders, I do not believe those risks are any where  near as dire as the Company’s 17 \nwitnesses make them out to be , and shareholders are compensated for accepting those 18 \nrisks with a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair rate of return as determined by the 19 \nCommission. Further, while the proposed Acquisition would eliminate those risks for 20 \nALLETE’s existing shareholders, it would expose Minnesota Power’s ratepayers to new 21 \nand greater risks associated with the Partners’ apparent plans for ALLETE, which I 22 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 24 describe in greater detail below ,  and Department witness Vavro discusses in her 1 \ntestimony.  2 \n  In a ddition, reasonable avenues exist for the Company to further reduce its 3 \ncapital needs, by forgoing ownership of a relatively small fraction of the resources it is 4 \nplanning to construct, lessening the need to expose ratepayers to the potential 5 \nadditional risks the Acquisition may impose.  6 \n 7 \nIII. ACCESS TO THE PARTNERS’ EXPERTISE  8 \nQ. Please describe your assessment of the benefits of access to the Partners’ expertise 9 \nfrom your direct testimony.  10 \nA. I concluded that because Minnesota Power already has a competent management 11 \nteam, which the Partners are planning to leave in place, and because the Partners are 12 \nnot planning any significant operational changes at ALLETE, access to the Partners’ 13 \nexpertise is not a meaningful benefit that might arise from of the Acquisition.  14 \n 15 \nQ. Did either of the Partners’ witnesses respond?  16 \nA. Yes. I n rebuttal testimony, Jonathan Bram of GIP restated many of the same expertise - 17 \nrelated benefits GIP offers that he described in his direct testimony. Andrew Alley of 18 \nCPP Investments also discussed CPP Investments’ past investment in Puget Sound 19 \nEnergy and highlighted its relationships and ability to facilitate introductions.   20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 25 Q. Did Mr. Bram or Mr. Alley provide any information that caused you to reconsider your 1 \nposition?  2 \nA. No. In fact, Mr. Alley’s description of CPP Investments ability to facilitate an introduction 3 \nbetween Minnesota Power and Octopus Energy, a company in which CPP Investments 4 \nowns a large stake, only heightens my concerns about affiliate interest issues.  5 \n  Thus,  I continue to conclude that access to expertise is not a meaningful benefit 6 \nof this transaction.  7 \n 8 \nIV.

In my direct testimony, I noted that investors typically ex pect higher returns from 14 \nprivate equity investments than from public equity investments .

For example, if the owners of a 3 \nbusiness worth $100 million invest an additional $10 million into it, and its value 4 \nincrease s to $110 million, the business will have grown, but no value will have been 5 \ncreated. The owners will simply have transferred $10 million of their other assets to the 6 \nbusiness.  Similarly, if a business reinvests all of its earnings into itself rather than paying 7 \ndividends, and the value of the business increases by only as much as the earnings 8 \nreinvested, no value will have been created.  9 \n 10 \nQ. Are there circumstances in which growth does create value?  11 \nA. Yes. Growth creates value if the expected return on the incremental investments driving 12 \nthe growth is greater than the cost of capital. For example, if a business can borrow 13 \nmoney at 5 percent per year, and invest in projects that are expected to generate 14 \nreturns of 10 percent per year, then its value will increase. But authorized ROEs for 15 \nutilities are supposed to be set at the cost of capital, which should limit value increases 16 \nfrom growth.   17 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 30 Q.

As I mentioned in my direct testimony, a tactic private equity firms commonly use  15 \nto increase their investment returns beyond that which is typically  thought  available in 16 \npublic equity markets is financial engineering, that is, increasing the proportion of debt 17 \nused to finance a company’s operations.51 A private equity firm can add extra debt to a 18 \ncompany’s balance sheet right away by initially funding its acquisition of the company 19 \nwith a large amount of debt, or it can add the debt over time by purchasing the 20 \ncompany with a large amount of equity and then replacing that equity with debt as time 21 \n \n51 Ex.

To the contrary, I specifically explained in my direct testimony why I believe the 1 \nproposed ring -fencing provisions are not adequate to fully insulate Minnesota Power’s 2 \nratepayers from higher debt costs (and therefore higher rates) resulting from exposure 3 \nto risks associated debt held at Alloy Parent.60 Mr. Bram ignored that explanation in his 4 \nrebuttal testimony, as did all Petitioner witnesses.  5 \n 6 \nQ. Do you agree with Mr. Bram that there is any sense in which ALLETE would benefit 7 \nfrom Alloy Parent issuing debt?  8 \nA. N o. Mr. Bram’s statement is unclear, but he seems to mean that ALLETE would benefit 9 \nfrom the Alloy Parent debt  by hav ing the proceeds of that invested in ALLETE as equity. 10 \nWhile Mr. Bram is correct that in this situation, ALLETE (and therefore Minnesota 11 \nPower’s ratepayers) would not directly pay the interest on the Alloy Parent debt, 12 \nMinnesota Power’s ratepayers would have to pay Minnesota Power ’s much higher 13 \nauthorized rate of return on equity. Worse, this arrangement, called double leverage, 14 \nwould impose some of the costs of debt financing on Minnesota Power’s ratepayers 15 \nwhile allowing Alloy and the Partners to enjoy the associated benefits.  16 \n  A s  I explained in my direct testimony, rising debt loads bring both costs and 17 \nbenefits.61 Starting from a low level of debt, the benefits of additional debt (primarily 18 \nthe tax savings created by the deductibility of interest expense) outweigh the costs (the 19 \nincreased risk of bankruptcy caused by the increase in fixed payment obligations).

Did any Petitioner witnesses address your concerns about the potential for Minnesota 14 \nPower’s cost of debt to increase as a result of  financing decision at the Alloy level?  15 \nA. Yes. First, Ms. Bulkley noted that in all future rate proceedings, the Commission will 16 \nhave the authority to determine a reasonable cost of debt to set for ratemaking 17 \npurposes, and can set a ratemaking cost of debt lower than the actual cost of debt if it 18 \nso chooses.70 Second, in their rebuttal testimony, the Petitioners committed that, for 19 \nthree years following the Acquisition, if Minnesota Power’s cost of debt increases above 20 \n \n68 Ex.

MP- __ at 5 (Bulkley Rebuttal).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 41 its current levels, ratepayers will be held harmless unless Minnesota Power can 1 \ndemonstrate that the increase was not caused by the Acquisition.71  2 \n 3 \nQ. How do you respond?  4 \nA. While I generally agree with Ms. Bulkley that the Commission will set Minnesota 5 \nPower’s cost of debt for ratemaking purposes, if the Company’s cost of debt increases, 6 \nit will be  because its risk in the real world has increased, and there would  be negative 7 \nreal- world  implications associated with that increase in risk. Simply pretending for 8 \npurposes of setting rates that the Company is not riskier does not erase those negative 9 \neffects, and in fact might exacerbate the problems by reducing the Company’s cash 10 \nflows, which would further harm its credit metrics.  11 \n  The  three -year commitment to hold ratepayers harmless from increases in the 12 \ncost of debt resulting from the transaction is a weak concession. The cost of debt for 13 \nratemaking purposes is determined using a utility’s embedded cost of debt, or the 14 \naverage interest rate on its outstanding bonds, weighted by the principal balances of 15 \nthose bonds. The embedded cost of debt therefore changes slowly, as new debt 16 \nissuances get averaged into the utility’s existing stock of debt. Therefore , there is not a 17 \ngreat potential for Minnesota Power’s embedded cost of debt to rise much in just three 18 \nyears.   19 \n \n71 Ex.

Please summarize your conclusions.  2 \nA. My conclusions are unchanged from my direct testimony. I continue to conclude that:  3 \n• The Acquisition is unlikely to provide Minnesota Power with meaningfully 4 \nimproved access to capital, and there is at least some potential that the 5 \nAcquisition will worsen the Company’s access to capital.  6 \n• Access to the Partners’ expertise resulting from the Acquisition is unlikely to 7 \nprovide any meaningful benefits to Minnesota Power’s ratepayers or the public 8 \ninterest generally.  9 \n• If the Partners employ financial engineering strategies to increase the returns 10 \nthey earn from their investments in Alloy, the extra debt may cause Minnesota 11 \nPower’s cost of capital to rise, which would result in rates that are higher than 12 \nthey otherwise would have been absent the Acquisition.  13 \n• Ultimately, the Acquisition should not be expected to provide any meaningful 14 \nbenefits to ratepayers or the public interest, and poses several significant risks, 15 \nas discussed above and by Department witness Stephanie Vavro. As a result, 16 \nsubstantial binding commitments by the Petitioners to fully address governance 17 \nand Alloy indebtedness would be necessary for  the Acquisition to pass the 18 \nCommission’s balancing test, as the potential detriments presently outweigh the 19 \npotential benefits.   20 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION REDACTED\n \n \nAddonizio Surrebuttal / 43 Q.

Test the theory.\nBy John H. Cochrane May 20, 2014 CBR - Finance\nIn 1970, in “Efcient Capital Markets: a Review of\nTheory and Empirical Work,” Eugene F.\nFama  dened a market to be “informationally\nefcient” if prices at each moment incorporate all\navailable information about future values. Informational\nefciency is a natural consequence of competition,\nrelatively free entry, and low costs of information. If there\nis a signal, not incorporated in market prices, that future\nvalues will be high, competitive traders will buy on that\nsignal. In doing so, they bid the price up, until it fully\nreects the information in the signal.Much of the confusion about “efciency” reects simple\nignorance of this denition. Fama used a common word\nto dene a precise phenomenon apart from the word’s\ncolloquial meaning. Researchers dene terminology this\nway all the time—“efcient” estimators in statistics,\n“Pareto-efcient” allocations in economics, and so forth\nhave precise denitions. But people who don’t know those\ndenitions can say and write nonsense about the\nacademic work.3/24/25, 4:45 PM Eugene F.

An informationally efcient market can\nhave economically inefcient runs and crashes, so long\nas those crashes are not predictable. To say “the crash\nproves markets are inefcient” or “markets are inefcient;\nnance academics did not foresee the crash” is a classic\nreection of this ignorance. The main prediction of Gene’s\nefcient-markets hypothesis is exactly that stock price\nmovements are unpredictable! An informationally\nefcient market is not supposed to be clairvoyant.

DOC-__, CMA-S-3 \nPage 3 of 10\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE  \nSECRET  INFORMATION REDACTED\nI once told a reporter that I thought markets were pretty\nefcient. He quoted me as saying that markets are “self-\nregulating.” Here is somebody with no clue about the\ndenition of the term (although I had explained its\ndenition). Informational efciency means one and only\none thing: prices reect available information.A simple\ntheory and\ncomplex\nfactsThe efcient-markets theory did not become famous\nbecause it is complex. The greatness of Fama’s\ncontribution lies in the fact that efcient-markets became\nthe organizing principle for decades of empirical work in\nnancial economics. This empirical work taught us much\nabout the world, and in turn affected the world deeply.When you think of Fama, don’t think of Einstein, churning\nout equations in the solitude of the Swiss patent ofce.\nThink of Darwin, who also saw that a simple principle—\nevolution by natural selection—organized and gave\npurpose to a vast collection of facts. Fama is really most\nfamous for putting all the facts together, personally\ncollecting a lot of nch beaks, and guring out how the\ncuriosities collected by others t in to the framework, in\noften challenging and unexpected ways.Furthermore, though the principle is simple, its\nimplications are often surprising, subtle, and remain\ncontroversial to this day. Efciency implies that simple\ntrading rules (e.g. “buy when the market went up\nyesterday”) should not work. This is a testable proposition,3/24/25, 4:45 PM Eugene F. Fama, Efficient Markets, and the Nobel Prize | Chicago Booth Review\nhttps://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/eugene-fama-efficient-markets-and-the-nobel-prize 4/10\nDocket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nEx. DOC-__, CMA-S-3 \nPage 4 of 10\nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE  \nSECRET  INFORMATION REDACTED\nand an army of nancial economists, including Gene,\nchecked it. The surprising empirical result is that trading\nrules, technical systems, market newsletters, and so on\nhave essentially no power beyond that of luck to forecast\nstock prices. This is not a theorem, an axiom, a\nphilosophy, or a religion: it is an empirical prediction that\ncould easily have come out the other way, and sometimes\ndoes.Similarly, if markets are informationally efcient,\nfundamental analysis performed by investment rms has\nno power to select stocks, and professional active\nmanagers should do no better at picking stock portfolios\nthan monkeys with darts. This is a remarkable\nproposition. In any other eld of human endeavor,\nseasoned professionals systematically outperform\namateurs. But other elds are not so ruthlessly\ncompetitive as nancial markets.Many studies checked this proposition. It’s not easy.\nAmong other problems, you only hear from the winners.\nNobody writes articles celebrating the worst-performing\nmutual fund manager. You need to collect data from the\nlosers, too, and separate luck from skill.\nThese studies found, surprisingly, that the data are much\ncloser to the efcient-markets prediction than anybody\nthought. Professional managers do not systematically\noutperform well-diversied passive investments. This\ncould easily have come out the other way. It would have\nbeen lovely had it come out the other way. Academics who\nearn our salaries teaching MBA students would be\ndelighted to instruct them that better knowledge and\ntraining lead to more protable investment management.\nToo bad the facts say otherwise.If markets are informationally efcient, corporate news\nevents such as earnings announcements should be\nimmediately reected in stock prices. Now, actually\nchecking stock-price reactions to corporate events is also\nnot as straightforward as it sounds. But Gene and his\ncoauthors provided the standard solution to all of the3/24/25, 4:45 PM Eugene F.

The\nimmense event-study literature followed, allowing\nacademic accounting to measure the effect of corporate\nevents by the associated stock price movements.\nThe practical implications of the nding that markets are\nsurprisingly efcient are enormous. The rise of the index\nfund owes much to efciency. Without efciency, we\nmight all be invested with high-fee active managers who\npromise us higher returns at someone else’s expense.\nStandard procedures in accounting, regulation, and law\nnow routinely presume that asset prices are the best\nmeasure of value.Are markets completely efcient? No, and Gene said so in\nhis very rst article. Efciency, like all perfect-competition\nsupply-and-demand economics, is an ideal, which real-\nworld markets can only approach. Empirical work can nd\nonly how close to or far from the ideal a given market is.\nBringing\nscience to\nﬁnanceToo much nance is ex post storytelling, with not much\nmore content than “markets went up—the gods must be\npleased.” More than a theory, efcient-markets was the\nbanner for bringing scientic method to the study of\nnancial markets. Rather than ask, “What are Warren\nBuffett’s three secrets of success?” or interview the latest\nsoothsayer, researchers started to collect clean data, and\nexamine theories systematically and objectively. Gene\nwas the leader of this movement, and set the\nmethodological standard for how academics do empirical\nresearch.3/24/25, 4:45 PM Eugene F.

Event studies of the release of inside information\nusually nd large stock-market reactions. Evidently, that\ninformation is not fully incorporated ex ante into prices.\nRestrictions on insider trading are somewhat effective.\nWhen markets are not efcient, the tests verify the fact. A\ntheory that can be rejected is a real theory.These are only a few examples. The nancial world is full\nof novel claims, especially that there are easy ways to\nmake money. Investigating each anomaly takes time,\npatience, and sophisticated empirical skill. One has to\ncheck whether the gains were not luck, and whether the\ncomplex systems do not generate good returns by\nimplicitly taking on more risk.For nearly half a century, Gene Fama’s efcient-markets\nframework has provided the organizing principle for\nempirical nancial economics, and continues to do so. A\nnew round of studies is examining again the abilities of\nfund managers, focusing on new ways of sorting the lucky\nfrom the skillful in past data.Gene’s bottom line is always: Look at the facts. Collect the\ndata. Test the theory. Like astronomy, every time we look,\nthe world surprises us totally. And it will again.\nJohn H.

BACKGROUND AND QUALIFICATIONS 1 \nQ1.  Please state your name and employer. 2 \nA1.  My name is Douglas B. Jester. I am Managing Partner of 5 Lakes Energy, a Michigan 3 \nlimited liability corporation, located at PO Box 869, Northport, Michigan 49670.  4 \nQ2.  On whose behalf is this testimony being offered?  5 \nA2. I am testifying on behalf of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota.  6 \nQ3.  Are you the same Douglas Jester wh o previously submitted direct testimony in this 7 \nproceeding?   8 \nA3. Yes. 9 \nQ4.  Are you sponsoring any Schedule s in relation to your surrebuttal testimony ?  10 \nA4. No.  11 \nII. PURPOSE OF TESTIMONY 12 \nQ5.  What is the purpose and scope of your testimony? 13 \nA5. I am responding to the rebuttal testimony of John Quackenbush in support of the Petition 14 \nof Minnesota Power in the present case. Mr. Quackenbush rebuts my direct testimony in this 15 \nproceeding. 16 \nIII. RESPONSE TO JOHN QUACKENBUSH REBUTTAL TO MY DIRECT 17 \nTESTIMONY 18 \nQ6. Please summarize Mr. Quackenbush’s rebuttal to your direct testimony . 19 \nA6. In his direct testimony in this case, Mr. Quackenbush testified about the Michigan Public 20 \nService Commission’s approval of the transfer of control of Upper Peninsula Power Company 21 \n(“UPPCO”) to Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners in 2014  in settlement of Case No. U -17564 22 \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nJester Surrebuttal \n2\n and the subsequent transfer of control of UPPCO to Axium UP Holdings LLC after settlement of 1 \nCase No. U -20995. 2 \nIn my direct testimony, I reported that several subsequent UPPCO cases  before the Michigan 3 \nPublic Service Commission  were very contentious as UPPCO sought to recover significant cost 4 \nincreases related to the transfer of control  and sought a high cost of capital on its rate base. 5 \nIn rebuttal, Mr. Quackenbush walks through each of the issues I identified as contentious sequelae 6 \nto the  UPPCO  transfer of control  and attempts to  represent that these issues were not a result of 7 \nthe transfer of control or that the Michigan Public Service Commission satisfactorily resolved the 8 \nissue when presented.  The issues I raised in direct testimony that Mr. Quackenbush undertakes to 9 \nrebut were:  10 \n•UPPCO requested a large increase in its return on common equity, partly on the basis 11 \nthat it was now a small, higher -risk, utility than when it was a wholly owned subsidiary 12 \nof Integrys . 13 \n•UPPCO requested substantial increases in expenses to recover increases in pension 14 \ncosts, notwithstanding the representation of the parties in the transfer of control case 15 \nthat the UPPCO pension was fully funded by Integrys, which was compounded by an 16 \nextremely high ratio of pensioners to employees that was not examined in the transfer 17 \nof control case. 18 \n•UPPCO reduced distribution system maintenance investment during the transfer of 19 \ncontrol and until its next rate case, then proposed a large increase for the future test 20 \nyear. 21 \n•UPPCO requested substantial costs to increase staffing as it separated from shared 22 \nmanagement services previously provided by Integrys  as well as substantial costs for 23 \nadditional office space and for new information systems. 24 \n•UPPCO was slow to terminate an above -market power purchase agreement with a 25 \nprevious affiliate utility .126 \n1 Michigan Public Service Commission Case No U -17911, Direct testimony of Douglas B Jester available from https://mi -\npsc.my.site.com/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/068t0000001UPGEAA4.  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nJester Surrebuttal \n \n3 \n • UPPCO’s debt while it was owned by Balfour Beatty was entirely owed to Balfour 1 \nBeatty through an affiliate transaction. In my opinion, the costs of that debt were 2 \npersistently high compared to the costs of debt directly to various other Michigan 3 \nutilities.  4 \nQ7.  What is your reply to Mr. Quackenbush’s rebuttal testimony?   5 \nA7. The significance of my direct testimony was that a commission considering authorizing a 6 \ntransfer of control should not take at face value an applicant’s claim that transfer of control will 7 \nnot cause an increase in rates but  should be diligent about considering possible issues the applicant 8 \nmight raise in the aftermath of obtaining control of a utility and  should address those in the transfer 9 \nof control proceeding. Failure to do so leads to significant case costs for the commission and 10 \nintervenors, some risk of rate increases caused by the transfer of control, and likely disappointment 11 \nof expectations on the part of the investor that took control of the utility.  12 \nQ8. What is your reply to Mr. Quackenbush  regarding UPPCO’s request for a large increase 13 \nin its return on common equity  in the first UPPCO rate case following transfer of control?  14 \nA8. Mr. Quackenbush characterizes the dispute about return on common equity in Michigan Public 15 \nService Commission Case No. U -17274 as routine and not a result of the transfer of control  of 16 \nUPPCO.2 I agree that is not uncommon for utilities to propose increases in return on equity in rate 17 \ncases, and for Commission’s to adjudicate  those proposals. The distinguishing feature of the 18 \nargument about return on equity in this case was that most of the requested increase in return on 19 \nequity was inclusion of a premium due to the risk associated with UPPCO being a small utility.  20 \nBut UPPCO had become a small utility as a result of  the transfer of control, when it had previously 21 \nbeen controlled by a reasonably large utility holding company. Balfour Beatty either 22 \nmisrepresented their intentions  when they represented in  the transfer of control case that the 23 \ntransfer of control would not affect rates, or they reneged on that claim  when filing the next 24 \nsubsequent rate case. An expectation on this topic could have been included in the terms of the 25 \ntransfer of control settlement.  26 \n \n2 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for the Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Gl obal \nInfrastructure Partners, Rebuttal Testimony of John D. Quackenbush, Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 (March 4, 2025) \n(“Quackenbush Rebuttal”),  28: 1- 15. \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nJester Surrebuttal \n \n4 \n Q9. What is your reply to Mr. Quackenbush regarding UPPCO’s request for recovery of 1 \nincreases in pension costs?   2 \nA9. Mr. Quackenbush acknowledges that pension costs were an issue in Michigan Public Service 3 \nCommission Case No. U -17274 and represents this as a benign selection amongst alternatives 4 \nproposed by UPPCO to deal with a newly established stand- alone pension plan.3 The fundamental 5 \nissue about the pension in that case was that Integrys apparently placed every Integrys employee 6 \nor pensioner that had worked for UPPCO into the new UPPCO pension plan, creating a pension 7 \nplan with more  pensioners than active employees. Then UPPCO obtained a pension funding 8 \nanalysis after the transfer of control  that showed a substantial shortfall of pension assets relative 9 \nto projected pension requirements. The result was a need for significant additional funding for the 10 \npension, for which UPPCO presented alternatives. Scrutiny of the arrangements for the new 11 \npension plan could have had greater scrutiny in the transfer of control case.  12 \nQ10. What is your reply to Mr. Quackenbush regarding UPPCO’s  changes in distribution 13 \nsystem maintenance investment around the transfer of control?   14 \nA10. Mr. Quackenbush represents that the “timing of distribution system maintenance investment 15 \nduring the UPPCO transition” was not abnormal.4 The issue I raised in my direct testimony was 16 \nthat UPPCO , under Integrys control , appeared to  significantly reduce normal distribution system 17 \nadditions during the period when transfer of control was under consideration; then UPPCO , under 18 \nBalfou r Beatty  control, accelerated investments to catch up on routine maintenance.  19 \nAccording to UPPCO  FERC Form 1, Page 206, line  75, column (c)  for years  2013 through 2014 20 \nand 2019 and thereafter  and FERC Form 1, Page 208(M), line 76, column (c)  for years 2015 21 \nthrough 2018,5 the annual additions to distribution plant for UPPCO were as follows:  22 \n 23 \nYear  Additions to Distribution Plant  \n2013  $8,813,531  \n2014  $4,749,021  \n \n3 Quackenbush Rebuttal , 28: 17- 28 \n4 Quackenbush Rebuttal , 29:1-10 \n5 Obtained from https://www.michigan.gov/mpsc/consumer/electricity/data -price/electric -annual -reports on March 24, 2025. \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nJester Surrebuttal \n \n5 \n 2015  $7,523,938  \n2016  $4,391531  \n2017  $10,506612  \n2018  $10,941,976  \n 1 \nBearing in mind that the transfer of control case was filed in late 2013 and settled in 2014, and the 2 \nsubsequent rate case was filed in September 2015 based on a projected test year  that mostly falls 3 \nin 2017, this pattern is as I described. From 2014 through 2016, distribution system maintenance 4 \ncapital additions were lower, then increased as I described in my direct testimony. This behavior  5 \ncould have been addressed in the transfer of control case, with an expectation that  the sale of 6 \nUPPCO was priced premised on routine maintenance investments  rather than post -sale catchup 7 \ninvestments that would add to rates. 8 \nQ11. What is your reply to Mr. Quackenbush regarding UPPCO’s increased staffing costs 9 \nas it separated from shared management services previously provided by Integrys?   10 \nA11.  Mr. Quackenbush simply uses his rebuttal on this issue to explain that this will not happen 11 \nin the proposed transfer of control of ALLETE.6 I do not dispute nor agree with his position on 12 \nthis aspect of the proposed transfer of control of ALLETE in the present case. The fact remains 13 \nthat there were significant transition costs at UPPCO that were not accounted for in representations  14 \nby the Applicants in the UPPCO transfer of control case —including Applicants’ representations  15 \nthat the transfer of control would not affect rates. Diligence during the transfer of control case 16 \ncould have uncovered these costs and informed the Commission’s decision about the transfer of 17 \ncontrol. 18 \nQ12. What is your reply to Mr. Quackenbush regarding UPPCO’s  slowness in terminating 19 \nan above- market power purchase agreement with a previous affiliate utility ?  20 \nA12. Mr. Quackenbush asserts that my criticism of  UPPCO  on this matter simply reflects that the 21 \nCommission did not agree with me.7 In fact, the problem was that UPPCO did not timely give 22 \n \n6 Quackenbush Rebuttal , 29:12- 22 \n7 Quackenbush R ebuttal , 29:24 through 30: 11 \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nJester Surrebuttal \n \n6 \n notice of an intent to cancel. A commitment to cancellation could have been included in the  transfer 1 \nof control case.  2 \nQ13. What is your reply to Mr . Quackenbush regarding UPPCO’s cost of debt held by 3 \nBalfour Beatty?  4 \nA13. Mr. Quackenbush implicitly  dismisses this issue because my client  in various UPPCO cases , 5 \nCitizens Against R ate Excess  (CARE) , did not pursue the issue. He also hastens to add that this 6 \nwill not be an issue with the ALLETE transfer of control, because ALLETE plans to borrow  from 7 \nthe public debt market.8 Given that CARE was highly resource constrained, Mr. Quackenbush’s 8 \nimplied critique is meaningless. I do not dispute or affirm his assertion that this issue will not arise 9 \nin the case of ALLETE transf er of control in the present case. This issue, like the others discussed 10 \nabove, was to illustrate that a commission considering transfer of control should be diligent about 11 \nexploring issues that might arise as a result of the transfer of control. 12 \nIV. RECOMMENDATIONS  13 \nQ14. Based on your experience in the UPPCO transfer-of- control cases, what d o you 14 \nrecommend to the Minnesota Commission?   15 \nA14. In my direct testimony, I stated that “if the Commission approves the proposed transfer of 16 \ncontrol of ALLETE, I recommend that the Commission do so on the basis of an explicit financial 17 \nstructure that is rendered as explicit conditions on the transfer of control as well  as addressing 18 \nother concerns the Commission may have about aspects of ALLETE’s current or near future 19 \noperations.” I stand by that recommendation.   20 \n \n8 Quackenbush Rebuttal , 30:13- 26 \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA-24-198 \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nJester Surrebuttal"

    "content": "Ms. Elizabeth M. Brama , Legal Counsel  \nAllete/Minnesota Power  \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board  \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners/Black Rock  \n \nDear Ms. Brama : \n \nPlease accept this message as notiﬁcation that Commission Staff will be asking some questions at \nthe upcoming evidentiary hearings related to MPUC Docket No. E-015/PA- 24-198  (OAH Docket No. \n25-2500 -40339 ). \n \nQuestions we intend to ask are:  \n1. Would Mr. Quackenbush  be willing to ﬁle into e -Dockets the 2024 10K  he references on \npage 3 of his March 4, 2025 Rebuttal Testimony ? \n2. Please reconcile the capital needs described in testimony in this proceeding with the \ncapital needs as  described in the 10K ﬁling mentioned above , and  with  the capital needs \nthat will be required as described in  the Company’s recently ﬁled Integrated Resource Plan \n(IRP)  in MPUC Docket No. E -015/RP -25-127 . \n3. How did the proposed transaction inﬂuence the planning of the IRP mentioned above?  \n4. For any regulated utility where, independently or collectively, either the Canada Pension \nPlan Investment Board and/or Global Infrastructure Partners/Black Rock currently has an ownership interest of 40%  or more , please provide those utility’s capital structure before \nclosing and its most current capital structure.  \n5. For any regulated utility where, independently or collectively, either the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and/or Global Infrastructure Partners/Black Rock previously had, but \nno longer has, an ownership interest of 40% or more, please provide those utility’s capital \nstructure before closing and its capital structure at the time of divesture.  \n6. If the Commission were to approve the sale , would the “new Minnesota Power” accept the \nfollowing conditions:  \nA. Limit s to the capital structure  used for ratemaking purposes ? \nB. In the Company’s ﬁrst rate case after the acquisition, would the Company be willing to \nextend its statutory deadline for a ﬁnal Commission Order?  \nC. \nCommit to using an “all -in” allocation for the determination of retail rates in future \nrate cases, where all transmission facilities revenues are used to oﬀset costs.  \nSo that these questions can be directed to the appropriate Company witnesses, Commission Staff requests that, at Friday’s conference call with the ALJ, the Company provide the information \nregarding which witnesses will be able to address these questions.  \nThank you.  \nSincerely,  \nRobert Manning"
