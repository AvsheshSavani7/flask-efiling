They make promises innegotiations that are often not enforceable like keeping the headquarters in Duluth. They are knownto acquire a company in order to grow their own portfolios and cash flow relying heavily on debt,cost cutting, and raising costs to the consumers. They have investors interests first and foremost,not the consumer or the environment. It is a mistake to hand over this public company to this kindof private equity firm particularly in this environment of loosening regulations at the federal level."

It has always been a company that valued and served local interests and itsclients. KThe acquisition by a fund such as BlackWater is very dangerous and can derail the excellentpublic service Allete has started. It is realized Allete is a business and must be aware of futureplans. But this acquisition would take the backbone of services for Northern MN and bringthem to a group who has no local ties.   And also could sell off.  The US is losing control of its own infrastructure to foreign or business-first investorsPlease do not vote for this acquisition. Thank youSusan J IsernhagenDuluth MN"

We can see that\nBlackRock does not put people over profit, because they play a large part in, and profit off thedeforestation of the Amazon Rainforest.We can also look to other places where acquisitions of this type have occurred… One utility in Texastaken over by private equity went bankrupt, another owned by private equity in Michigan has muchhigher residential rates than the neighboring co-op utilities also serving Michigan’s UP. \nI also feel concerned about the conflict of interest with Blackrock’s commitment to spending 100\nBillion dollars in AI Data centers throughout the world, and how these data centers are beingproposed in Minnesota as of recently.

They will undo all the progress we’ve made onrenewable energy all in the name of shareholder value.\nMP/Allete represent the values of Duluth, Blackrock most\ncertainly does not."

As a NE MN resident, I have\nfamiliarized myself with the issue and it is clear that the proposed sale would benefit the buyers and not the public.There are better ways for MN Power to raise the capital they claim to require to meet current and future needs.

This acquisition is notconsistent with the public interest.\nI have done a fair amount of research on private equity and they generally do not act in the public interest.  Nursing\nhomes run by private equity companies have death rates 10% higher than other nursing homes .  The reason we haveutility companies is to ensure that important services are provided to the public in an effective manner.  BlackRockdoesn't share that goal.  It would be fool hearted to establish a precedent of selling off our utilities to private equitycompanies. Furthermore pension funds are not reliable utility operators.  All they care about is funding theirpensions not whether electricity is delivered in a consistent and cost effective manner.  Pls opposé this sale.  It\nwould be opening a Pandora's box.\nThe interests of big private equity investors for outsized profits is inconsistent with the need to provide Minnesota\nPower customers and communities with the affordable, reliable, clean, and safe electricity we all need. This is a baddeal for Minnesota.\nOur state has committed to clean energy by 2040.  Black Rock does not share that goal.  Furthermore BlackRock\noperates without any transparency.\nPlease uphold the intention behind the creation of public utilities and don't sell away our services to the highest\nbidder.\nSincerely,\nlisa franchett\nMinneapolis, MN 55409-1923lisafranchett@gmail.com\nFrom: jianhuaqian@everyactioncustom.com  on behalf of JIANHUA QIAN\nTo: Staff, CAO (PUC)\nSubject: Reject the ALLETE/MN Power acquisition by Canada PPI Board & GIP (BlackRock) / PUC Docket Number 24-198\nDate: Monday, April 7, 2025 10:32:27 PM\n[You don't often get email from jianhuaqian@everyactioncustom.com.

This acquisition is not consistent with the public interest.\nWhile regulated utilities like Minnesota Power are guaranteed a profit when they build or expand infrastructure (like\nbuilding a new gas plant), they don’t make money on “operational” costs, like maintenance and customer service.Investors looking for a high rate of return aren’t incentivized to maximize the things that make their service safe andreliable, meaning customers would face deteriorating service reducing reliability. The new owners have much highertarget profits than the normal rate of return for a Minnesota utility, and need to extract that value from the companysomehow – cutting unprofitable activities would support this goal.\nThe interests of big private equity investors for outsized profits is inconsistent with the need to provide Minnesota\nPower customers and communities with the affordable, reliable, clean, and safe electricity we all need.

Learn why this is important\nYour honor,\nMy name is Megan Perry-Spears.  I am a ratepayer in Duluth and I strongly oppose\nthis transaction which will negatively impact my family and neighbors and the futurestability of the northland of Minnesota. I urge you to deny approval. \nI want to remind you that the MN Public Utilities commission can not approve thisproposed acquisition unless it makes findings that it is in the public interest in order toapprove it. It is not.  Minnesota Power has not demonstrated the need for the\nproposed acquisition or any benefit to the people of the Northland.  –To be clear, thisis not in the public interest and I urge the Commission to deny the proposal, as thelaw requires.\nBlackrock is already embedded in the energy industry–especially by way of\ncompanies that have a history of harming the water and environment. To approve theproposal would be to create a huge conflict of interest. Blackrock’ is the single largestshareholder of Enbridge Energy. Enbridge is one of Minnesota Power’s pipelinecustomers. CPP is a major investor in resource extraction companies in Canada,including oil and gas drillers and Enbridge. \nThese conflicts of interest become super problematic when you look at the profit\nexpectations of private equity firms like Blackrock. This proposed acquisition is likelyto raise rates for customers, because private equity investors demand higher profitsthan normal market investors. Over and over and over again in these kinds ofacquisitions the cost of the demanded profits gets passed on to the consumer. Privateequity wants the most profit in the relative short term, which is NOT good for thenorthland.  Blackrock most likely will go for high profit infrastructure investment ratherthan what is best for the people and the environment.  \nI am worried about this for my kids.  Not only will they face the higher rates, they will\nbe left holding the bag environmentally.  Low cost solar and wind resources likely willnot align with the profit motive of private equity that will always choose maximizing\nprofits in the short term, before the ownership term is up. \nSpeaking of the ownership term, when private equity firms have raised the rates and\nsqueezed all the short-term profit they can at the expense of the people and the land,they will sell the system off to the highest bidder, likely to other private equity, makingit impossible for public bidders to make a competitive bid. If you allow this sale, that iswhat will happen.  GIP and CPP will take control of the ALLETE Board of Directors.This is a threat to local control, as they will seek influence of Minnesota Power’sbusiness plans, budget, investments and corporate strategy.  \nMy neighbors here in Duluth cannot afford to pay rising rates to fill the pockets of\nprivate equity billionaires. My children cannot afford the impact on the environment. GIP and CPP say they share the goal of transitioning to clean energy, but they will notcommit to things like retiring the Boswell coal plant on schedule. We know they willhave a conflict of energy in the extraction of oil and gas and  the pipeline industry. We don’t need a billionaire monopoly in our region controlling something so importantas our power.\nFor the sake of Minnesota, for the sake of the people, for the sake of my children and\nyour children, vote no. This sale is not in the best interest of the people. \nThank you, \nMegan Perry-SpearsDuluth Resident-- Megan Perry-Spears\nDo not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly now.

Learn why this is important\nTO: PUC regarding  PUC Docket Number 24-198\n \nI want to register my opposition to the possible purchase of Minnesota Power fromAllete, Inc., headquartered locally , by the two institutional investor conglomerates\n(especially GIP), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and GlobalInfrastructure Partners (GIP). My major concern is related to the term “headquarteredlocally,” which describes the current owner, Allete, Inc. Allete, Inc., is also primarilyinvested in regulated utilities and likely better understands this business better than anon-local institutional investor primarily focused on maximizing profits. To me, thismeans Allete, Inc., is much more likely aware of its public utility responsibility to itsusers of power as a service-provider in terms of long-term planning for maintainingquality, reliability, and efficiency -- and maintaining stable and reasonable costs for itscustomers. \n \nThank you,\n \nPaul M Anderson1972 Hartley RoadDuluth, MN 55803218-728-5853panderso@d.umn.edu\nNN Power customer\n \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nTo Whom It Concerns,\nI am a Duluth, MN resident/homeowner. I am alarmed to learn of the proposed sale of MN\nPower, by Allete, to the joint venture of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) andGlobal Infrastructure Partners (GIP). A significant portion of my concern lies in theknowledge that GIP is owned by BlackRock, the world’s largest private equity investmentfirm. \nAs a private equity company, BlackRock's only goal is to generate profit for their\nshareholders. They currently manage assets that exceed the GDP of most nations in the world. They could care less about the future viability of a relatively small utility company.  So theirinterest in this purchase is suspect, in my opinion. Purchasing our local utility under the guiseof CIP seems underhanded to me; and it is also clear in my mind that the customers who relyon fair pricing and good service from MN Power will be of little concern for this group.  \nI have read that the buyers have offered to pay between $393 million and $1.5 billion above\nMN Power's actual value. This would obviously be a windfall for ALLETE shareholders;however, the buyers will expect to recoup their investment through profits.  Such an over-inflated purchase price will create a challenging situation for CPP & GIP to recoup theirinvestment through generated profit. The customers of MN Power will be penalized in thissale with rate increases and diminished service. If the purchasers are unable to profit in thispurchase, it is likely our local utility service will be sold again ... further diminishing anyvested interest in our region. \nBlackRock has a reputation that disregards environmental concerns, such as solar and wind-\ngenerated power.  They are a known large investor in the oil industry.  I do not see how theirpurchase of our local utility will benefit our region.  They are purely profit-driven and have noconcern as to the damage they leave on local regions or economies, when they decide to moveon. \nAs a proud Minnesotan concerned about global climate change and equity issues that are\nfacing our world, and as a lifelong customer of MN Power, it breaks my heart to think that ourlocally owned utility will go the way of capitulation to billionaires. \nI respectfully implore the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to deny this sale.Respectfully yours,Rebecca G.

Learn why this is important\nHello,\nMy name is Alice Lesch and I work a lot in central and northern Minnesota and have\ndeveloped meaningful relationships with the people there. I am expressing my concernregarding the proposed acquisition of Minnesota Power/ALLETE by the Canada Pension PlanInvestment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners/BlackRock.\nDespite my extensive work in the area, I have not heard about this potential purchase until\ntoday. Thanks to the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, I was informed that I can and shouldsubmit a comment if I am concerned. \nI am particularly concerned regarding the proposed purchaser. I do not feel comfortable\nallowing a large Minnesota-based business to be purchased by BlackRock. Minnesotamust not compromise our democratic structure despite the current political climate whichfavors gross corporate greed and influence in state and federal government. Especially in thecase of a utility where the economies of scale are so large to enter the industry that thegovernment needs to accommodate these monopolies just to serve their constituents withpower. The following is a quote from the Citizens Utility Board which states this issue veryconcisely: \n\"The buyers have agreed to buy ALLETE at a substantial premium. They will want to make\nback their investment. \nExpert witnesses in the case have estimated that the buyers have offered to pay between $393million and $1.5 billion above the company’s actual value. This is a windfall for ALLETEshareholders that the buyers will expect to recoup, with profits.  \nWhile ALLETE holds multiple businesses, regulated utilities make up the majority of its\nrevenue (81% in 2024). It will be difficult, if not impossible, for the new owners to make backthe purchase premium without leaning on ratepayers, which could lead to rate increases forMinnesota Power customers.\nOf course, Minnesota Power’s rates must be approved by the PUC, and the company will\ncontinue to have to justify any rate increases. However, if the PUC denies the rate increasesthat Minnesota Power’s new owners want, the owners may decide it is not in their interest toinvest much more money in the company, to the detriment of the quality of service thatMinnesotans receive.\"\nThank you for taking your time to read my comment.\nAlice Lesch\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

For years\nthe stock price had steadily increased topping out at $87.60 per share on September 27, 2019.When COVID hit, the price dropped along with the rest of the stock market. The rest of the market isrecovering, but ALLETE with the purchase agreement in place, has no reason to go over the $67purchase price. Are we losing out on any possible gains due to this?\nAs a person that has a fair understanding of the stock market, why would the Partners want to\nincrease their investment in ALLETE unless they could increase their return? The only way to increasetheir return on investment would be to increase rates which would end up hurting the customers.\nAs a worker that has gone through a buyout, I know firsthand that there is no guarantee that they\nwill be treated the same after the current contract ends. I lost wages and benefits.\nAs a customer, I do not like the idea of a foreign group controlling my power utility with limited\naccountability. We are not given any choice on where we get our electricity. The price increases keepcoming in one form or another. On January 24, 2001 my bottom line cost for electricity was $0.069per kwh. My last bill was $0.19 per kwh. And there are more increases in the process. There is noreason for The Partners to buy us other than to make even more money off of us.\nSteven Schmidt\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.
