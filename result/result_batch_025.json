Business\nOverview.\nALLETE is a leader in the nation’s clean-energy transformation. Our businesses and dedicated employees deliver sustainable energy solutions that mitigate\nclimate change, build thriving communities, help customers reach their sustainability goals and drive value for shareholders. In 2020, ALLETE’s largest\nbusiness, Minnesota Power, reached a milestone of providing 50 percent renewable energy to its retail and municipal customers in Minnesota, and in 2024\ndelivered 55 percent renewable energy to those customers. Minnesota Power is making significant progress toward 100 percent carbon-free energy supply\n—a vision grounded in a steadfast commitment to climate, customers and community through its EnergyForward strategy. ALLETE Clean Energy, our\nsecond-largest business, is positioned at the heart of society’s clean-energy transformation and owns, operates and has developed for others more than\n1,600 megawatts of wind energy generation across eight states—helping some of the largest companies in the country reduce their carbon footprint. Our\nnewest business, New Energy, is a leading developer of community, commercial and industrial, and small utility-scale renewable energy projects that has\ncompleted more than 575 MW in its history.\nMinnesota Power’s latest IRP, approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9, 2023, outlines its clean-energy transition plans through 2035. These\nplans include expanding its renewable energy supply to 70 percent by 2030, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a\nresilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. Minnesota Power has also set a target to achieve an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by\n2035 compared to 2005 levels. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding up to 700 MW of new wind and solar energy resources, and\nceasing coal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Minnesota Power’s plans recognize that advances in technology will play\na significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably.\nIn recent years, Minnesota Power has transformed its company-owned energy supply from more than a 95 percent reliance on coal to become a leader in\nthe nation’s clean-energy transformation. Since 2013, the company has closed or converted seven of its nine coal-fired units and added nearly 900\nmegawatts of renewable energy sources. Additionally, Minnesota Power has been a leader in energy conservation, surpassing the state’s conservation goals\neach year for the past decade.\nOn February 7, 2023, the Minnesota Governor signed a law that updates the state’s renewable energy standard and requires Minnesota electric utilities to\nsource retail sales with 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. Ongoing progress towards compliance with Minnesota's carbon-free standard is evaluated\nin IRP proceedings at the MPUC. Minnesota Power's next IRP will be filed in March 2025 and address progress towards compliance with the 2040 law.\nMinnesota Power is also working with various stakeholders and participating in the regulatory process to implement this law. (See Regulated Operations –\nMinnesota Legislation.)\nOn May 5, 2024, ALLETE entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, on and subject to the conditions set forth therein,\nAlloy Merger Sub will merge with and into ALLETE, with ALLETE continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and becoming a subsidiary of\nAlloy Parent. (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger.)\nFor more information regarding the terms of the Merger, including a copy of the Merger Agreement, see ALLETE’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with\nthe SEC on May 5, 2024, and ALLETE’s definitive proxy statement relating to the special meeting of shareholders filed with the SEC on July 10, 2024.\nALLETE is committed to earning a financial return that rewards our shareholders, allows for reinvestment in our businesses, and sustains growth. ALLETE\nis predominately a regulated utility through Minnesota Power, SWL&P, and an investment in ATC. ALLETE’s strategy is to remain predominately a\nregulated utility while investing in ALLETE Clean Energy, New Energy and its Corporate and Other businesses to complement its regulated businesses,\nbalance exposure to the utility’s industrial customers, and provide potential long-term earnings growth.\nRegulated Operations includes our regulated utilities, Minnesota Power and SWL&P, as well as our investment in ATC, a Wisconsin-based regulated\nutility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. Minnesota Power provides\nregulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately 150,000 retail customers. Minnesota Power also has 14 non-affiliated\nmunicipal customers in Minnesota. SWL&P is a Wisconsin utility and a wholesale customer of Minnesota Power. SWL&P provides regulated utility\nelectric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately 15,000 electric customers, 13,000 natural gas customers and\n10,000 water customers. Our regulated utility operations include retail and wholesale activities under the jurisdiction of state and federal regulatory\nauthorities. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n8\nOverview (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects.

In 2024, industrial customers represented 56 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. Our industrial customers are primarily in\nthe taconite mining, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, and pipeline industries. Cliffs idled all production at its Northshore mine in 2022 and\nresumed partial pellet plant production in April 2023.

These taconite facilities are owned by Cliffs and USS Corporation. (See Large Power\nCustomer Contracts.) Sales to taconite customers represented 4,897 million kWh, or 70 percent, of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2024. Taconite,\nan iron bearing rock of relatively low iron content, is abundantly available in northern Minnesota and an important domestic source of raw material for the\nsteel industry. Taconite processing plants use large quantities of electric power to grind the iron-bearing rock, and agglomerate and pelletize the iron\nparticles into taconite pellets.\nMinnesota Power’s taconite customers are capable of producing approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in\nMinnesota are primarily shipped to North American steelmaking facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry, which continue to lead the world in\nenvironmental performance among steelmaking countries. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, steel production in the U.S. is the most energy\nefficient of any major steel producing country. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles,\nappliances, tubular applications for all industries, and in the construction industry. Steel is also a critical component of the clean energy transformation\nunderway today. The demand for more renewable energy and the need for additional infrastructure to transport green energy from the point of generation to\nthe end user both require steel. Historically, approximately 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside of North America.\nThere has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an\nassociation of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 76 percent of capacity in 2024 (75\npercent in 2023 and 78 percent in 2022). The World Steel Association, an association of steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations,\nand steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2025 will increase by\napproximately 2 percent compared to 2024.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n10\nREGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers (Continued)\nThe following table reflects Minnesota Power’s taconite customers’ production levels for the past ten years:\nMinnesota Power Taconite Customer Production\nYear Tons (Millions)\n  2024* 34\n2023 35\n2022 32\n2021 39\n2020 30\n2019 37\n2018 39\n2017 38\n2016 28\n2015 31\nSource: Minnesota Department of Revenue 2024 Mining T ax Guide for years 2015 - 2023.\n* Preliminary data fr om the Minnesota Department of Revenue.\nMinnesota Power’s taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term\ndemand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power’s taconite customers’ production would impact\nour annual earnings per share by approximately $0.07, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or\ncustomer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is\ntemporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a\npermanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue.\nIn addition to serving the taconite industry, Minnesota Power serves a number of customers in the paper, pulp and secondary wood products industry, which\nrepresented 714 million kWh, or 10 percent of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2024. Minnesota Power also has an agreement to provide steam for\none paper and pulp customer for use in the customer’s operations. The major paper and pulp mills we serve reported operating at similar levels in 2024\ncompared to 2023. Sofidel completed the acquisition of the Duluth Mill from ST Paper in the first quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, Sofidel\nannounced plans to invest between $200 million and $250 million to add a conversion facility and automated warehouse to the tissue plant. (See Outlook –\nRegulated Operations – Industrial Customers – Paper, Pulp and Secondary Wood Products – Sofidel.)\nLarge Power Customer Contracts. Minnesota Power had eight Large Power Customer contracts as of December 31, 2024, each serving requirements of\n10 MW or more of customer load. Certain facilities with common ownership are served under combined contracts. The customers as of December 31,\n2024, consisted of six taconite facilities owned by Cliffs and USS Corporation as well as four paper and pulp mills. Minnesota Power also serves\nNorthshore Mining through a PSA with its affiliate Silver Bay Power, in addition to the load served through its Large Power Customer contract with United\nTaconite and Northshore Mining. (See Silver Bay Power PSA.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n11\nREGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLarge Power Customer Contracts (Continued)\nLarge Power Customer contracts require Minnesota Power to have a certain amount of generating capacity available. In turn, each Large Power Customer\nis required to pay a minimum monthly demand charge that covers the fixed costs associated with having this capacity available to serve the customer,\nincluding a return on common equity. Most contracts allow customers to establish the level of megawatts subject to a demand charge on a three- to four-\nmonth basis and require that a portion of their megawatt needs be committed on a take-or-pay basis for at least a portion of the term of the agreement. In\naddition to the demand charge, each Large Power Customer is billed an energy charge for each kWh used that recovers the variable costs incurred in\ngenerating electricity. Five of the Large Power Customer contracts have interruptible service which provides a discounted demand rate in exchange for the\nability to interrupt the customers during system emergencies. Minnesota Power also provides incremental production service for customer demand levels\nabove the contractual take-or-pay levels. There is no demand charge for this service and energy is priced at an increment above Minnesota Power’s cost.\nIncremental production service is interruptible.\nAll contracts with Large Power Customers continue past the contract termination date unless the required advance notice of cancellation has been given.\nThe required advance notice of cancellation varies from two to four years. Such contracts reduce the impact on earnings that otherwise would result from\nsignificant reductions in kWh sales to such customers. Large Power Customers are required to take all of their purchased electric service requirements from\nMinnesota Power for the duration of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity and energy provided under these\ncontracts are subject to change through the same regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Regulatory Matters – Electric Rates.)\nMinnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large Power Customers to pay weekly for electric usage based on monthly\nenergy usage estimates. These customers receive estimated bills or make weekly prepayments based on Minnesota Power’s estimate of the customer’s\nenergy usage, forecasted energy prices and fuel adjustment clause estimates. Minnesota Power’s taconite producing Large Power Customers have generally\npredictable energy usage on a week-to-week basis and any differences that occur are trued-up the following month.\nContract Status for Minnesota Power Large Power Customers\nAs of December 31, 2024 \nCustomer Industry Location OwnershipEarliest\nTermination Date\nCliffs – Minorca Mine (a) Taconite Virginia, MN Cliffs December 31, 2028\nHibbing Taconite (a)(d) Taconite Hibbing, MN 85.3% Cliffs\n14.7% USS CorporationDecember 31, 2028\nUnited Taconite and Northshore\nMining (a)Taconite Eveleth, MN and Babbitt,\nMNCliffs December 31, 2028\nUSS Corporation\n(USS – Minnesota Ore) (b)(d)Taconite Mtn.

Minnesota Power has a PSA with Silver Bay Power through 2031 to supply its full energy requirements. Silver Bay Power supplies\napproximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power.\nResidential and Commercial Customers. In 2024, residential and commercial customers represented 19 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales.\nMunicipal Customers. In 2024, municipal customers represented 4 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales.\nMinnesota Power’s wholesale electric contracts with 14 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota have termination dates ranging from 2029\nthrough 2037, with a majority of contracts expiring in 2029. One of these wholesale contracts includes a termination clause requiring a 3-year notice to\nterminate. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nOther Power Suppliers. The Company also enters into off-system sales with Other Power Suppliers. These sales are at market based prices into the MISO\nmarket on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations.\nOur PSAs are detailed in Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraphs.\nMinnkota Power PSA. Minnesota Power has a PSA with Minnkota Power where Minnesota Power is selling a portion of its entitlement from Square Butte\nto Minnkota Power, resulting in Minnkota Power’s net entitlement increasing and Minnesota Power’s net entitlement decreasing until Minnesota Power’s\nshare is eliminated at the end of 2025. Of Minnesota Power’s 50 percent output entitlement, it sold approximately 41 percent to Minnkota Power in 2024\n(37 percent in 2023 and 32 percent in 2022). Minnkota Power’s net entitlement increases to approximately 46 percent in 2025 and 50 percent in 2026. (See\nPower Supply – Long-Term Purchased Power.)\nHibbing Public Utilities. Minnesota Power has a long-term power contract with Hibbing Public Utilities for the period of June 1, 2022, through May 31,\n2027.\nSeasonality\nThe operations of our industrial customers, which make up a large portion of our electric sales, are not typically subject to significant seasonal variations.\n(See Electric Sales / Customers.) As a result, Minnesota Power is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in electric sales; however,\nMinnesota Power and SWL&P electric and natural gas sales to other customers may be affected by seasonal differences in weather. In general, peak electric\nsales occur in the winter and summer months with fewer electric sales in the spring and fall months. Peak sales of natural gas generally occur in the winter\nmonths. Additionally, our regulated utilities have historically generated fewer sales and less revenue when weather conditions are milder in the winter and\nsummer.\nPower Supply\nIn order to meet its customers’ electric requirements, Minnesota Power utilizes a mix of its own generation and purchased power. In 2024, 55 percent of\nMinnesota Power’s power supply for its retail and municipal customers in Minnesota has been provided by renewable energy sources. This was enabled by\nthe completion of the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind energy facility in December 2020 and the GNTL in June 2020, which is used to deliver 250 MW of\nhydroelectric energy from Manitoba Hydro. Minnesota Power’s remaining operating coal-fired facilities are Boswell Units 3 and 4, which Minnesota\nPower plans to cease coal operations at by 2030 and 2035, respectively. (See Regulatory Matters.) Renewable energy percentages may vary year to year\nbased on weather, system demand and transmission constraints.\nThe following table reflects Minnesota Power’s generating capabilities as of December 31, 2024, and total electrical supply for 2024.

Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin region located in Montana and Wyoming. Coal\nconsumption in 2024 for electric generation at Minnesota Power’s coal-fired generating stations was 2.3 million tons (2.7 million tons in 2023; 2.7 million\ntons in 2022). As of December 31, 2024, Minnesota Power had coal inventories of 0.6 million tons (0.7 million tons as of December 31, 2023). Minnesota\nPower has coal supply agreements providing for the purchase of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2025. In 2025, Minnesota\nPower expects to obtain coal under these coal supply agreements and in the spot market. Minnesota Power continues to explore other future coal supply\noptions and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be available.\nMinnesota Power also has coal transportation agreements in place for the delivery of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2027.\nThe costs of fuel and related transportation costs for Minnesota Power’s generation are recoverable from Minnesota Power’s utility customers through the\nfuel adjustment clause.\nCoal Delivered to Minnesota Power\nYear Ended December 31 2024 2023 2022\nAverage Price per Ton $40.20 $41.23 $39.98 \nAverage Price per MBtu $2.20 $2.30 $2.25 \nLong-Term Purchased Power. Minnesota Power has contracts to purchase capacity and energy from various entities, including output from certain coal,\nwind, hydro and solar generating facilities.\nOur PPAs are detailed in Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraph.\nSquare Butte PPA. Under the PPA with Square Butte that extends through 2026, Minnesota Power is entitled to 50 percent of the output of Square Butte’s\n455 MW coal-fired generating unit. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) BNI Energy mines and sells lignite coal to Square Butte.\nThis lignite supply is sufficient to provide fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating unit. Square Butte’s cost of lignite consumed in 2024 was\napproximately $2.25 per MBtu ($2.36 per MBtu in 2023; $2.05 per MBtu in 2022). (See Electric Sales / Customers – Minnkota Power PSA.)\nManitoba Hydro. Minnesota Power has two long-term PPAs with Manitoba Hydro. The first PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase 250 MW of\ncapacity and energy from Manitoba Hydro through May 2035. The second PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase up to 133 MW of energy from\nManitoba Hydro through June 2040. A third PPA, which expired in April 2022 was an energy-only agreement, which primarily consisted of surplus hydro\nenergy on Manitoba Hydro’s system that was delivered to Minnesota Power on a non-firm basis.\nWind Energy. Minnesota Power has a long-term PPA with Nobles 2 that provides for Minnesota Power to purchase the energy and associated capacity from\na 250 MW wind energy facility in southwestern Minnesota through 2040. The agreement provides for the purchase of output from the facility at fixed\nenergy prices. There are no fixed capacity charges, and Minnesota Power will only pay for energy as it is delivered. (See Corporate and Other – Investment\nin Nobles 2.) Minnesota Power also has two long-term wind energy PPAs with an affiliate of NextEra Energy, Inc. to purchase the output from Oliver Wind\nI (50 MW) and Oliver Wind II (48 MW) located in North Dakota.\nSolar Energy. Minnesota Power purchases solar energy from approximately 20 MW of solar energy facilities located in Minnesota that are owned by an\nALLETE subsidiary, and a one MW community solar garden in northeastern Minnesota, which is owned and operated by a third party.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n15\nREGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)\nTransmission and Distribution\nWe have electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 kV (232 miles), 345 kV (241 miles), 250 kV (466 miles), 230 kV (715 miles), 161 kV (43\nmiles), 115 kV (1,387 miles) and less than 115 kV (6,685 miles). We own and operate 154 substations with a total capacity of 10,647 megavolt-amperes.\nSome of our transmission and distribution lines interconnect with other utilities, and we own some of our transmission lines jointly with other utilities. (See\nNote 3. Jointly-Owned Facilities and Assets and Outlook – Regulated Operations – Transmission.)\nGreat Northern Transmission Line. As a condition of the 250 MW long-term PPA entered into with Manitoba Hydro, construction of additional\ntransmission capacity was required. As a result, Minnesota Power constructed the GNTL, an approximately 220 ‑ mile 500-kV transmission line between\nManitoba and Minnesota’s Iron Range that was proposed by Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro in order to strengthen the electric grid, enhance\nregional reliability and promote a greater exchange of sustainable energy. In June 2020, Minnesota Power placed the GNTL into service with project costs\nof approximately $310 million incurred by Minnesota Power. Total project costs, including those costs contributed by a subsidiary of Manitoba Hydro,\ntotaled approximately $660 million. The 250 MW PPA with Manitoba Hydro commenced when the GNTL was placed into service.\nInvestment in ATC\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, ALLETE Transmission Holdings, owns approximately 8 percent of ATC, a Wisconsin-based utility that owns and maintains\nelectric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. We account for our investment in ATC under the equity method of\naccounting. As of December 31, 2024, our equity investment in ATC was $194.4 million ($179.7 million as of December 31, 2023). (See Note 6. Equity\nInvestments.)\nATC’s authorized return on equity was 10.02 percent, or 10.52 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission\norganization, based on a 2020 FERC order which is subject to various outstanding legal challenges related to the return on equity calculation and refund\nperiod ordered by the FERC. On August 9, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the 2020 FERC\norder back to the FERC. On October 17, 2024, FERC ordered a return on equity of 9.98 percent, or 10.48 percent including an incentive adder for\nparticipation in a RTO, effective September 28, 2016.\nIn addition, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in April 2021 to limit the 50 basis point incentive adder for participation in a regional\ntransmission organization to only the first three years of membership in such an organization. If this proposal is adopted, our equity in earnings from ATC\nwould be reduced by approximately $1 million pre-tax annually.\nATC’s most recent 10-year transmission assessment, which covers the years 2024 through 2033, identifies a need for between $8.9 billion and $10.9 billion\nin transmission system investments. These investments by ATC, if undertaken, are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated\ncash, debt and investor contributions. As opportunities arise, we plan to make additional investments in ATC through general capital calls based upon our\npro rata ownership interest in ATC.\nProperties\nOur Regulated Operations businesses own office and service buildings, an energy control center, repair shops, electric plants, transmission and distribution\nfacilities and storerooms in various localities in Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota. All of the electric plants are subject to mortgages, which\ncollateralize the outstanding first mortgage bonds of Minnesota Power and SWL&P. Most of the generating plants and substations are located on real\nproperty owned by Minnesota Power or SWL&P, subject to the lien of a mortgage, whereas most of the transmission and distribution lines are located on\nreal property owned by others with appropriate easement rights or necessary permits from governmental authorities. WPPI Energy owns 20 percent of\nBoswell Unit 4. WPPI Energy has the right to use our transmission line facilities to transport its share of Boswell generation. (See Note 3. Jointly-Owned\nFacilities and Assets.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n16\nREGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRegulatory Matters\nWe are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory authorities and other organizations. Regulatory matters and proceedings are detailed in Note 4.\nRegulatory Matters, with a summary included in the following paragraphs.\nElectric Rates. All rates and contract terms in our Regulated Operations are subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities. Minnesota Power and\nSWL&P design their retail electric service rates based on cost of service studies under which allocations are made to the various classes of customers as\napproved by the MPUC or the PSCW. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses, which may adjust electric service rates for changes in the\ncost of fuel and purchased energy, recovery of current and deferred conservation improvement program expenditures and recovery of certain transmission,\nrenewable and environmental investments.\nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission. The MPUC has regulatory authority over Minnesota Power’s retail service area in Minnesota, retail rates, retail\nservices, capital structure, issuance of securities and other matters. Minnesota Power’s retail base rates through 2022 were based on a 2018 MPUC retail\nrate order that allowed for a 9.25 percent return on common equity and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. Interim rates were implemented in Minnesota Power’s\n2022 general rate case beginning in January 2022, and the resolution of Minnesota Power’s 2022 general rate case changed the allowed return on equity to\n9.65 percent and the equity ratio to 52.50 percent beginning October 1, 2023. (See 2022 Minnesota General Rate Case.) Minnesota Power expects to\nimplement updated rates based on the 2024 MPUC retail rate order in the first quarter of 2025. This order allows for a return on equity of 9.78 percent and\nan equity ratio of 53.00 percent. As authorized by the MPUC, Minnesota Power also recognizes revenue under cost recovery riders for transmission and\nrenewable investments.\n2024 Minnesota General Rate Case. On November 1, 2023, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average\nincrease of approximately 12.00 percent for retail customers, net of rider revenue incorporated into base rates. The rate filing sought a return on equity of\n10.30 percent and a 53.00 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would have generated approximately $89 million in\nadditional revenue. In separate orders dated December 19, 2023, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and approved an annual interim rate increase of\napproximately $64 million, net of rider revenue, beginning January 1, 2024, subject to refund.\nOn May 3, 2024, Minnesota Power entered into a settlement agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Minnesota Office of the Attorney\nGeneral, Residential Utilities Division, and Large Power Intervenors to settle the retail rate increase request. As part of the settlement agreement, the parties\nagreed on all issues, including an overall rate increase of $33.97 million, net of rider revenue and amounts transferring to the fuel adjustment clause, a\nreturn on equity of 9.78 percent, an equity ratio of 53.00 percent, all non-financial items and cost allocation. In an order dated November 25, 2024, the\nMPUC approved the settlement agreement. Final rates are expected to be implemented in the first quarter of 2025; interim rates will be collected through\nthis period with reserves recorded as necessary. As a result of the settlement, Minnesota Power recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund of\n$23.0 million pre-tax as of December 31, 2024, which is subject to MPUC approval of Minnesota Power’s refund calculation.\n2022 Minnesota General Rate Case. In an order dated February 28, 2023, the MPUC made determinations regarding Minnesota Power’s general rate case\nincluding allowing a return on common equity of 9.65 percent and a 52.50 percent equity ratio. In March 2023, Minnesota Power filed a petition for\nreconsideration with the MPUC requesting reconsideration and clarification of certain decisions in the MPUC’s order. The MPUC denied the requests for\nreconsideration in an order dated May 15, 2023.\nIn an order dated September 29, 2023, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power’s final rates, which were implemented beginning on October 1, 2023. The\nMPUC order also approved Minnesota Power’s interim rate refund plan. Interim rates were collected through the third quarter of 2023 with reserves\nrecorded as necessary. Minnesota Power recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund of approximately $39 million pre-tax as of September 30, 2023\n(approximately $18 million as of December 31, 2022), which was refunded to customers during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nMinnesota Power appealed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals (Court) specific aspects of the MPUC’s February 2023 and May 2023 rate case orders for\nthe ratemaking treatment of Taconite Harbor and Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset. On September 9, 2024, the Court affirmed the MPUC’s\nTaconite Harbor treatment, but reversed and remanded the treatment of Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset back to the MPUC. The Court directed\nthe MPUC to determine the amount of Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset to be included in rate base. The MPUC has not yet determined the next\nprocedural steps in implementing the Court’s decision.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n17\nREGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRegulatory Matters (Continued)\nMinnesota Power Land Sales. In August 2020, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC for approval to sell land that surrounds several reservoirs\non its hydroelectric system and is no longer required to maintain its operations. The land had an estimated value of approximately $100 million, and\nMinnesota Power proposed to credit ratepayers the net proceeds from the sales in a future rate case or through its renewable resources rider to mitigate\nfuture rate increases. In a November 2021 order, the MPUC authorized the land sales and directed the net proceeds to be refunded to ratepayers subject to\ncertain conditions and required compliance filings. As of December 31, 2024, we have a regulatory liability recorded of $59.7 million related to these sales.\n2021 Integrated Resource Plan. On February 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed its latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9,\n2023. The approved IRP, which reflects a joint agreement reached with various stakeholders, outlines Minnesota Power’s clean-energy transition plans\nthrough 2035. These plans include expanding its renewable energy supply, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a\nresilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding up to 700 MW of new wind and solar\nenergy resources, and ceasing coal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Minnesota Power’s plans recognize that advances\nin technology will play a significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. Minnesota Power is expected to\nfile its next IRP in March 2025.\nMinnesota Power is making significant progress toward 100 percent carbon-free energy supply, continuing its commitment to climate, customers and\ncommunities through its EnergyForward strategy. This vision builds on Minnesota Power’s achievement, in 2020, of providing 50 percent renewable\nenergy to its customers.\nPublic Service Commission of Wisconsin. The PSCW has regulatory authority over SWL&P’s retail sales of electricity, natural gas and water, issuances\nof securities and other matters. SWL&P’s retail rates through 2022 were based on a December 2018 order by the PSCW that allowed for a return on equity\nof 10.40 percent and a 55.00 percent equity ratio. The resolution of SWL&P’s 2022 general rate case changed the allowed return on equity to 10.00 percent\nand maintained an equity ratio of 55.00 percent. (See 2022 Wisconsin General Rate Case.) The resolution of SWL&P’s 2024 general rate case further\nchanged the allowed return on equity to 9.80 percent and continued to maintain an equity ratio of 55.00 percent beginning January 1, 2025. (See 2024\nWisconsin General Rate Case.)\n2024 Wisconsin General Rate Case. On March 29, 2024, SWL&P filed a rate increase request for its electric, gas and water utilities with the PSCW. The\nfiling sought an overall return on equity of 10.00 percent and a 55.00 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested change would have\nincreased rates by approximately 5.90 percent for retail customers and generate an estimated $7.3 million of additional revenue. In an order dated\nDecember 12, 2024, the PSCW approved an annual increase of approximately $5.5 million reflecting a return on equity of 9.80 percent and a 55.00 percent\nequity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2025.\n2022 Wisconsin General Rate Case. In an order dated December 20, 2022, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $3.3 million reflecting a return on\nequity of 10.00 percent and a 55.00 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2023.\nNorth Dakota Public Service Commission. The NDPSC has jurisdiction over site and route permitting of generation and transmission facilities in North\nDakota.\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the establishment of rates and charges\nfor transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, electricity sold at wholesale (including the rates for Minnesota Power’s municipal and wholesale\ncustomers), natural gas transportation, certain accounting and recordkeeping practices, certain activities of our regulated utilities and the operations of ATC.\nFERC jurisdiction also includes enforcement of NERC mandatory electric reliability standards. Violations of FERC rules are subject to enforcement action\nby the FERC including financial penalties up to $1 million per day per violation.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n18\nRegional Organizations\nMidcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. Minnesota Power, SWL&P and ATC are members of MISO, a regional transmission organization.\nWhile Minnesota Power and SWL&P retain ownership of their respective transmission assets, their transmission networks are under the regional\noperational control of MISO. Minnesota Power and SWL&P take and provide transmission service under the MISO open access transmission tariff. In\ncooperation with stakeholders, MISO manages the delivery of electric power across 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.\nNorth American Electric Reliability Corporation. The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC\nensures the reliability of the North American bulk power system. The NERC oversees six regional entities that establish requirements, approved by the\nFERC, for reliable operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and transmission systems. Minnesota Power is subject to these reliability\nrequirements and can incur significant penalties for noncompliance.\nMidwest Reliability Organization (MRO). Minnesota Power and ATC are members of the MRO, one of the six regional entities overseen by the NERC.\nThe MRO's primary responsibilities are to: ensure compliance with mandatory reliability standards by entities which own, operate or use the\ninterconnected, international bulk power system; conduct assessments of the grid's ability to meet electricity demand in the region; and analyze regional\nsystem events. The MRO region spans the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and all or parts of 16 states.\nMinnesota Legislation\nRenewable and Carbon-Free Energy Requirements. On February 7, 2023, the Minnesota Governor signed into law legislation that updates the state’s\nrenewable energy standard and requires Minnesota electric utilities to source retail sales with 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The law increases\nthe renewable energy standard from 25 percent renewable by 2025 to 55 percent renewable by 2035, and requires investor-owned Minnesota utilities to\nprovide 80 percent carbon-free energy by 2030, 90 percent carbon-free energy by 2035 and 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The law utilizes\nrenewable energy credits as the means to demonstrate compliance with both the carbon-free and renewable energy standards, includes an off ramp\nprovision that enables the MPUC to protect reliability and customer costs through modification or delay of either the renewable energy standard, the\ncarbon-free standard, or both, and streamlines development and construction of wind energy projects and transmission in Minnesota. Ongoing progress\ntowards compliance with Minnesota's Carbon Free Standard is evaluated in the IRP proceedings at the MPUC. Minnesota Power's next IRP will be filed in\nMarch 2025 and discuss progress towards compliance with the 2040 law. Minnesota Power is also working with various stakeholders and participating in\nthe regulatory process to implement this legislation.\nIn 2024, 55 percent of Minnesota Power’s power supply for its retail and municipal customers in Minnesota has been provided by renewable energy\nsources. Minnesota Power’s plans include expanding its renewable energy supply to 70 percent renewable energy by 2030. Minnesota Power has also set a\ntarget to achieve an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – EnergyForward.)\nMinnesota Solar Energy Standard. Minnesota law requires at least 1.5 percent of total retail electric sales, excluding sales to certain customers, to be\ngenerated by solar energy. At least 10 percent of the 1.5 percent mandate must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic\ndevices with a nameplate capacity of 40 kW or less and community solar garden subscriptions. Minnesota Power has met both parts of the solar mandate to\ndate.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n19\nREGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)\nCompetition\nRetail electric energy sales in Minnesota and Wisconsin are made to customers in assigned service territories. As a result, most retail electric customers in\nMinnesota do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. Large energy users of 2 MW and above that are located outside of a municipality are\nallowed to choose a supplier upon MPUC approval. Minnesota Power served eight Large Power Customers under contracts of at least 10 MW in 2024,\nnone of which have engaged in a competitive rate process. (See Electric Sales / Customers.) No other large commercial or small industrial customers in\nMinnesota Power’s service territory have sought a provider outside Minnesota Power’s service territory. Retail electric and natural gas customers in\nWisconsin do not have the ability to choose their energy supplier. In both states, however, electricity may compete with other forms of energy. Customers\nmay also choose to generate their own electricity, or substitute other forms of energy for their manufacturing processes.\nIn 2024, 4 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales were to municipal customers in Minnesota. These customers have the right to seek an energy supply\nfrom any wholesale electric service provider upon contract expiration. Minnesota Power’s wholesale electric contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities\nCommission is effective through 2037. Minnesota Power’s wholesale electric contracts with 13 other non-affiliated municipal customers are effective\nthrough 2029. (See Electric Sales / Customers.)\nThe FERC has continued with its efforts to promote a competitive wholesale market through open-access electric transmission and other means. As a\nresult, our electric sales to Other Power Suppliers and our purchases to supply our retail and wholesale load are made in a competitive market.\nFranchises\nMinnesota Power holds franchises to construct and maintain an electric distribution and transmission system in certain cities within its service territory. The\nremaining cities, villages and towns served by Minnesota Power do not require a franchise to operate. SWL&P serves customers under electric, natural gas\nor water franchises in one city and 14 villages and towns.\nALLETE CLEAN ENERGY\nALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns,\noperates, or has developed more than 1,600 megawatts of wind energy generation in five major energy markets and eight states across the U.S. with a\nmajority contracted under PSAs of various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate\nunder long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations – Outlook – ALLETE Clean Energy.)\nALLETE Clean Energy believes the market for renewable energy in North America is robust, driven by several factors including environmental regulation,\ntax incentives such as the extension of production tax credit and investment tax credits, societal expectations and continual technology advances. State\nrenewable portfolio standards, state or federal regulations to limit GHG emissions and the extension of production tax credit and investment tax credits are\nexamples of environmental regulation or public policy that we believe will drive renewable energy development.\nALLETE Clean Energy’s strategy includes the safe, reliable, optimal and profitable operation of its existing facilities. This includes a strong safety culture,\nthe continuous pursuit of operational efficiencies at existing facilities and cost controls. ALLETE Clean Energy generally acquires facilities in liquid power\nmarkets and its strategy includes the exploration of PSA extensions upon expiration of existing contracts, production tax credit requalification of existing\nfacilities or the sale of facilities.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n20\nALLETE CLEAN ENERGY (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy manages risk by having a diverse portfolio of assets, which includes PSA expiration, technology and geographic diversity. The\ncurrent operating portfolio is subject to typical variations in seasonal wind with higher wind resources typically available in the winter months. The\nmajority of its planned maintenance leverages this seasonality and is performed during lower wind periods. ALLETE Clean Energy’s current operating\nportfolio is as follows:\nRegion Wind Energy Facility Capacity MW MW PSA Expiration\nEast Armenia Mountain 101\nPSA 1 50% 2031\nPSA 2 50% 2031\nMidwest Lake Benton 104 100% 2028\nStorm Lake I 108 100% 2027\nStorm Lake II 77\nMerchant 90% n/a\nPSA 10% 2032\nOther 17 100% 2028\nSouth Caddo 303\nMerchant 27% n/a\nPSA 1 66% 2034\nPSA 2 7% 2034\nDiamond Spring 303\nPSA 1 58% 2035\nPSA 2 25% 2032\nPSA 3 17% 2035\nWest Condon 50 100% 2028\nGlen Ullin 106 100% 2039\nSouth Peak 80 100% 2035\nThe majority of ALLETE Clean Energy’s wind operations are located on real property owned by others with easement rights or necessary consents of\ngovernmental authorities. ALLETE Clean Energy’s Glen Ullin, South Peak, Diamond Spring and Caddo wind energy facilities are subject to tax equity\nfinancing structures. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.)\nCORPORATE AND OTHER\nNew Energy\nIn April 2022, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ALLETE acquired 100 percent of the membership interests of New Energy for a purchase price of $165.5\nmillion.

Minnesota Power is expected to purchase approximately 20 percent of the facility's output starting upon the completion of the facility\npursuant to a capacity dedication agreement. Construction of NTEC is subject to obtaining additional permits from local, state and federal authorities. The\ntotal project cost is estimated to be approximately $700 million, of which South Shore Energy will be responsible for approximately 20 percent. South\nShore Energy’s portion of NTEC project costs incurred through December 31, 2024, is approximately $10 million.\nBNI Energy\nBNI Energy is a supplier of lignite coal in North Dakota, producing approximately 4 million tons annually and has an estimated 650 million tons of lignite\ncoal reserves. Two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI Energy’s production of lignite under\ncost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements extending through December 31, 2037. (See Item 1. Business – Regulated Operations – Power Supply – Long-\nTerm Purchased Power and Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) The mining process disturbs and reclaims between 200 and 250 acres\nper year. Laws require that the reclaimed land be at least as productive as it was prior to mining. As of December 31, 2024, BNI Energy’s total reclamation\nliability is estimated at $82.1 million, which is included in Other Non-Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its present value. These\ncosts are included in the cost-plus fixed fee contract, for which an asset reclamation cost receivable was included in Other Non-Current Assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The asset reclamation obligation is guaranteed by surety bonds and a letter of credit. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees\nand Contingencies.)\nALLETE Properties\nALLETE Properties represents our legacy Florida real estate investment. ALLETE Properties’ major project in Florida is Town Center at Palm Coast,\nwhich consists of approximately 200 acres of land as well as various residential units and non-residential square footage. In addition to the Town Center at\nPalm Coast project, ALLETE Properties has approximately 500 acres of other land available for sale. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – Corporate and Other – ALLETE Properties.)\nSeller Financing. ALLETE Properties occasionally provides seller financing to qualified buyers. As of December 31, 2024, outstanding finance\nreceivables were $3.5 million, net of reserves, with maturities through 2029. These finance receivables accrue interest at market-based rates and are\ncollateralized by the financed properties.\nRegulation. A substantial portion of our development properties in Florida are subject to federal, state and local regulations, and restrictions that may\nimpose significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop the properties. Much of our property is vacant land and some is located in areas where\ndevelopment may affect the natural habitats of various protected wildlife species or in sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.\nNon-Rate Base Generation and Miscellaneous\nCorporate and Other also includes other business development and corporate expenditures, unallocated interest expense, a small amount of non-rate base\ngeneration, land holdings in Minnesota, and earnings on cash and investments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, non-rate base generation consists of 29 MW of natural gas and hydro generation at Rapids Energy Center in Grand Rapids,\nMinnesota, which is primarily dedicated to the needs of one customer, UPM Blandin, and approximately 20 MW of solar energy facilities located in\nSylvan, Hoyt Lakes, and Duluth, Minnesota, which sell energy generated to Minnesota Power.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n22\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOur businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the\nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities over the\npast several years. Minnesota Power’s facilities are subject to additional requirements under many of these regulations. Minnesota Power is reshaping its\ngeneration portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and\npolicy during rulemaking implementation.\nWe consider our businesses to be in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and believe all necessary permits have been\nobtained. We anticipate that with many state and federal environmental regulations and requirements finalized, or to be finalized in the near future,\npotential expenditures for future environmental matters may be material and require significant capital investments. Minnesota Power has evaluated various\nenvironmental compliance scenarios using possible outcomes of environmental regulations to project power supply trends and impacts on customers.\nWe review environmental matters on a quarterly basis. Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. Accruals are adjusted as assessment\nand remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. Costs related to\nenvironmental contamination treatment and cleanup are expensed unless recoverable in rates from customers. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and\nContingencies.)\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, recognize and retain high quality talent, align with strategic business objectives\nand support the Company’s values.

Both meetings are scheduled for May 13, 2025.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n25\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties discussed below could materially affect our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and\nshould be carefully considered by stakeholders. The risks and uncertainties in this section are not the only ones we face; additional risks and uncertainties\nthat we are not presently aware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations, financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows. Accordingly, the risks described below should be carefully considered together with other information set forth in this report and\nin future reports that we file with the SEC.\nRegulated Operations Risks\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted if our taconite, paper and pipeline customers experience an economic downturn, incur\nwork stoppages, fail to compete effectively, experience decreased demand, fail to economically obtain raw materials, fail to renew or obtain\nnecessary permits, or experience a decline in prices for their product.\nMinnesota Power’s Large Power Customers (see Item 1. Business – Regulated Operations – Electric Sales / Customers) and Silver Bay Power accounted\nfor 31 percent of our 2024 consolidated operating revenue (24 percent in 2023 and 29 percent in 2022) and 38 percent of Regulated Operations operating\nrevenue (36 percent in 2023 and 36 percent in 2022). Minnesota Power’s taconite customers, which are currently owned by only two entities at the end of\n2024, accounted for approximately 27 percent of consolidated operating revenue and 33 percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue in 2024. This\nconcentrated ownership presents customer concentration risk for the Company, and could lead to further capacity consolidation for both steel blast furnaces\nand related Minnesota iron ore production. These customers are also involved in cyclical industries that by their nature are adversely impacted by economic\ndownturns and are subject to strong competition in the marketplace. The North American paper and pulp industry also faces declining demand due to the\nimpact of electronic substitution for print and changing customer needs. As a result, certain paper and pulp customers have reduced their existing\noperations or idled facilities in recent years and have pursued or are pursuing product changes in response to declining demand. Additionally, the taconite\nindustry could be impacted by changing technology in the steel industry such as the adoption of electric arc furnaces for steelmaking, which could result in\ndeclining demand for taconite and the electricity used during its production.\nMinnesota Power also serves two pipeline customers that accounted for 2 percent of our 2024 consolidated operating revenue (2 percent in 2023 and in\n2022) and 2 percent of Regulated Operations revenue in 2024 (3 percent in 2023 and 2 percent in 2022). These customers are involved in an industry that is\nseeing increased environmental pressure for construction of new or expanded pipeline infrastructure for the transportation of fossil fuels. Changes in\nregulatory rulings or permit proceedings could result in changes to operations of the pipeline network in our service territory.\nAccordingly, if our industrial customers experience an economic downturn, incur a work stoppage (including strikes, lock-outs or other events), fail to\ncompete effectively, experience decreased demand, fail to economically obtain raw materials or operate their facilities, fail to renew or obtain necessary\npermits, or experience a decline in demand or prices for their product, there could be adverse effects on their operations and, consequently, this could have\na negative impact on our results of operations as we are unable to remarket at similar prices the energy that would otherwise have been sold to such\ncustomers.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategic objectives of growing load at our utilities if current or potential industrial or\nmunicipal customers are unable to successfully implement expansion plans, including the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits and\napprovals.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we pursue new wholesale and retail loads in and around our service territories. Currently, there are several companies in\nnortheastern Minnesota that are in the process of developing natural resource-based projects that represent long-term growth potential and load diversity for\nour Regulated Operations businesses. These projects may include construction of new facilities and restarts of old facilities, both of which require\npermitting and approvals to be obtained before the projects can be successfully implemented. If a project does not obtain any necessary governmental\n(including environmental) permits and approvals or if these customers are unable to successfully implement expansion plans, our long-term strategy and\nthus our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n26\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRegulated Operations Risks (Continued)\nOur businesses, investments and customers are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework under federal and state laws as well as\nregulations imposed by other organizations that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur businesses, investments and customers are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state law including\nregulations administered by the FERC, MPUC, MPCA, PSCW, NDPSC and EPA as well as regulations administered by other organizations including the\nNERC. These laws and regulations relate to allowed rates of return, capital structure, financings, rate and cost structure, acquisition and disposal of assets\nand facilities, construction and operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities (including the ongoing maintenance and reliable operation of\nsuch facilities), recovery of purchased power costs and capital investments, approval of integrated resource plans and present or prospective wholesale and\nretail competition, renewable portfolio standards that require utilities to obtain specified percentages of electric supply from eligible renewable generation\nsources, among other things. Energy policy initiatives at the state or federal level could increase or accelerate renewable and carbon-free energy standards\nor incentives for distributed generation, municipal utility ownership, or local initiatives could introduce generation or distribution requirements that could\nchange the current integrated utility model. (See Item 1. Business – Regulated Operations – Minnesota Legislation.) Our transmission systems and electric\ngeneration facilities are subject to the NERC mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. Compliance with these standards may lead\nto increased operating costs and capital expenditures which are subject to regulatory approval for recovery. If it was determined that we were not in\ncompliance with these mandatory reliability standards or other statutes, rules and orders, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions,\nwhich could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThese laws and regulations significantly influence our operations and may affect our ability to recover costs from our customers. We are required to have\nnumerous permits, licenses, approvals and certificates from the agencies and other organizations that regulate our business. We believe we have obtained\nthe necessary permits, licenses, approvals and certificates for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws;\nhowever, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies and other organizations.\nChanges in regulations, timing of approvals, the adoption of new regulations or the expansion of jurisdiction by these agencies and other organizations\ncould have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our ability to manage changing regulations could be impacted by our\nrights and obligations under joint ownership agreements.\nOur ability to obtain rate adjustments to maintain reasonable rates of return depends upon regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and\nwe cannot provide assurance that rate adjustments will be obtained or reasonable authorized rates of return on capital will be earned. Minnesota Power and\nSWL&P, from time to time, file general rate cases with, or otherwise seek cost recovery authorization from, federal and state regulatory authorities. If\nMinnesota Power and SWL&P do not receive an adequate amount of rate relief in general rate cases, including if rates are reduced, if increased rates are\nnot approved or recovered on a timely basis, if fuel adjustment clause recoveries or cost recovery for other items are not granted at the requested level, or\ncosts are otherwise unable to be recovered through rates, we may experience an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash\nflows. We are unable to predict the impact on our business and results of operations from future legislation or regulatory activities of any of these agencies\nor organizations.\nOur regulated operations present certain environmental risks that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, including\neffects of environmental laws and regulations, physical risks associated with climate change and initiatives designed to reduce the impact of GHG\nemissions.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our past, present and future operations, including air quality,\nwater quality and usage, waste management, reclamation, hazardous wastes, avian mortality and natural resources. These laws and regulations, or new laws\nand regulations that may be passed, can result in increased capital expenditures and increased operating and other costs as a result of compliance,\nremediation, containment and monitoring obligations, particularly with regard to laws relating to emissions, coal ash and water discharge at generating\nfacilities.\nThese laws and regulations could restrict the output of some existing facilities, limit the use of some fuels in the production of electricity, require the\ninstallation of additional pollution control equipment, require participation in environmental emission allowance trading, and lead to other environmental\nconsiderations and costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business, operations and results of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n27\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRegulated Operations Risks (Continued)\nThese laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other\napprovals. Violations of these laws and regulations could expose us to regulatory and legal proceedings, disputes with, and legal challenges by,\ngovernmental authorities and private parties, as well as potential significant civil fines criminal penalties and other sanctions. On August 12, 2024,\nMinnesota Power received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the MPCA, related to the spill at Boswell from a pipeline carrying ash wastewater from an\ninactive onsite storage pond to Blackwater Creek, which the Company reported on July 16, 2024. Minnesota Power continues to work with state and\nfederal agencies to evaluate and mitigate the impacts from this event. We are unable to predict the mitigation or other costs related to the ash wastewater\nspill at this time; however, the costs could be material. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nExisting environmental regulations may be revised and new environmental regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional\nregulations which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from\ncustomers, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding if and when new laws, regulations or administrative policies will be adopted to reduce or limit GHG and the\nimpact any such laws or regulations would have on us. In 2024, our operating coal-fired generating facilities consisted of the 352 MW Boswell Unit 3 and\nthe 468 MW Boswell Unit 4. (See Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Outlook –\nEnergyForward.) Any future limits on GHG emissions at the federal or state level, or action taken by regulators, before these facilities are retired or\nbecome coal-free may require us to incur significant capital expenditures and increases in operating costs, or could result in early closure of coal-fired\ngenerating facilities, stranded assets, an impairment of assets, denial of full recovery of decommissioning costs in excess of amounts previously collected,\nor otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if resulting expenditures and costs are not fully recoverable from customers.\nOur regulated operations may be adversely impacted by the physical and financial risks associated with climate change. See Entity-wide Risks for\nadditional discussion of risks related to GHG and climate change.\nWe cannot predict the amount or timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of uncertainty as to applicable regulations or\nrequirements. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially\nresponsible parties. Violations of certain environmental statutes, rules and regulations could expose ALLETE to third party disputes and potentially\nsignificant monetary penalties, as well as other sanctions for noncompliance.\nThe operation and maintenance of our regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities are subject to operational risks that\ncould adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe operation of generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up operational risks, breakdown or failure of facilities, the dependence on a\nspecific fuel source, inadequate fuel supply, availability of fuel transportation, and the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural\nevents, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. A significant portion of our facilities contain older generating\nequipment, which, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to continue operating at\npeak efficiency. Generation, transmission and distribution facilities and equipment are also likely to require periodic upgrades and improvements due to\nchanging environmental standards and technological advances. Our ability to manage and operate certain facilities could also be impacted by our rights and\nobligations under the joint ownership agreements. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce or deliver power,\nincluding failure caused by breakdown, forced outage or limited availability of fuel or fuel transportation, as well as the repair of damage to facilities due to\nbreakdown, storms, natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events. This could also lead to requiring additional purchased\npower to meet requirements of serving our retail load, which for Minnesota Power is subject to recovery under the fuel adjustment clause. Should these\ncosts be denied or are otherwise unable to be recovered, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n28\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRegulated Operations Risks (Continued)\nOur ability to successfully and timely complete capital repairs or improvements to existing regulated facilities or in the development of new\nelectric generation and transmission facilities or other capital projects is contingent upon many variables.\nWe expect to incur significant capital expenditures in making capital repairs or improvements to our existing electric generation and transmission facilities\nand in the development and construction of new electric generation and transmission facilities. Should any such efforts be unsuccessful, not completed in a\ntimely manner, if we are unable to obtain the necessary permits, land rights and regulatory approvals, or if there are increases in the costs for or limited\navailability of key materials, supplies, labor and services, we could be subject to additional costs or impairments, and projects may be delayed or canceled\nwhich could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows.\nOur regulated electric operations may not have access to adequate and reliable transmission and distribution facilities necessary to deliver\nelectricity to our customers.\nWe depend on our own transmission and distribution facilities, as well as facilities owned by other utilities, to deliver the electricity sold to our customers,\nand to other energy suppliers. If transmission capacity is inadequate or transmission and distribution facilities we rely on are damaged, our ability to sell\nand deliver electricity may be limited. We may have to forgo sales or may have to buy more expensive wholesale electricity that is available in a capacity-\nconstrained area. The ability to restore adequate capacity or repair damaged infrastructure may be impacted by the availability of key materials, supplies,\nlabor and services, which if unavailable may prolong the impact of capacity constraints or damaged facilities. In addition, any infrastructure failure or\ndamage that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity to our customers could negatively impact the satisfaction of our customers, which could have an\nadverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe price of electricity may be volatile and fuel may be volatile and availability may be limited.\nVolatility in market prices for electricity and volatility and limited availability of fuel could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations\nand may result from:\n•severe or unexpected weather conditions and natural disasters;\n•seasonality;\n•changes in electricity usage;\n•transmission or transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies;\n•availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;\n•changes in supply and demand for energy;\n•changes in power production capacity;\n•outages at our generating facilities or those of our competitors;\n•availability of fuel and transportation of fuel;\n•changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, crude oil and refined products;\n•wars, sabotage, terrorist acts, cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events; and\n•federal, state, local and foreign energy, environmental, or other regulation and legislation, including the direct and indirect effects of new or\nchanges in tariffs.\nVolatility in market prices for our fuel and purchased power costs impacts our sales to retail, municipal and Other Power Suppliers. Fluctuations in our fuel\nand purchased power costs related to our retail and municipal customers are passed on to customers through the fuel adjustment clause; however, our\nresults of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted if increased fuel adjustment clause rates are not approved or recovered on a timely basis, if\ncost recovery is not granted at the requested level, or costs are otherwise unable to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause.\nWholesale prices for electricity have also declined in recent years primarily due to the extension of renewable tax credits and additional renewable\ngeneration commencing operations. If there are reductions in demand from current customers, we lose retail customers, or we lose municipal customers that\ndo not renew existing contracts, we will market any available power to Other Power Suppliers in an effort to mitigate any earnings impact. Sales to Other\nPower Suppliers are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations. Due to\nwholesale prices for electricity being below our rates for retail and municipal customers, we do not expect that our power marketing efforts would fully\noffset the reduction in earnings resulting from the lower demand from existing customers or the loss of customers. (See Item 1. Business – Regulated\nOperations – Electric Sales / Customers.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n29\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRegulated Operations Risks (Continued)\nDemand for energy may decrease.\nOur results of operations are impacted by the demand for energy in our service territories, our municipal customers and other power suppliers. There could\nbe lower demand for energy due to a loss of customers as a result of economic conditions, customers constructing or installing their own generation\nfacilities, higher costs and rates charged to customers, eligible municipal and other power suppliers choosing an alternative energy provider, or loss of\nservice territory or franchises. Further, energy conservation and technological advances that increased energy efficiency may temporarily or permanently\nreduce the demand for energy products. In addition, we are impacted by state and federal regulations requiring mandatory conservation measures, which\nreduce the demand for energy products. Continuing technology improvements and regulatory developments may make customer and third party-owned\ngeneration technologies such as rooftop solar systems, WTGs, microturbines and battery storage systems more cost effective and feasible for certain\ncustomers. If customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline. There may not be future economic growth opportunities\nthat would enable us to replace the lost energy demand from these customers. Therefore, a decrease in demand for energy could adversely impact our\nfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks\nThe inability to successfully manage and grow our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company's strategy includes adding customers, new geographies, and growth through acquisitions or project development with long-term PSAs in\nplace for the output or to be sold upon completion. This strategy depends, in part, on the Company’s ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition\nor development opportunities and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms and obtain all required permits and approvals. The Company may compete\nwith other companies for these acquisition and development opportunities, which may increase the Company’s cost of making acquisitions and the\nCompany may be unsuccessful in pursuing these acquisition opportunities. Other companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to\nidentify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than the Company’s financial or human resources permit. New laws and regulations\npromoting renewable energy generation may result in increased competition. Our ALLETE Clean Energy business is experiencing return pressures from\nincreased competition, and lower forward price curves, as a growing amount of investment capital is being directed into wind energy generation\nopportunities. In addition, current and potential new project developments at our businesses can be negatively affected by a lower ALLETE stock price,\nwhich may result in such projects not being accretive, or otherwise unable to satisfy our financial objectives criteria to proceed. Additionally, tax law\nchanges may adversely impact the economic characteristics of potential acquisitions or investments. If the Company is unable to execute its strategy of\ngrowth through acquisitions, project development for others, or the addition of new customers and geographies, it may impede our long-term objectives\nand business strategy.\nAcquisitions and operations of recently acquired entities are subject to uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage future\nacquisitions and strategic investments, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our actual results may also differ from our\nexpectations due to factors such as the ability to obtain timely regulatory or governmental approvals, integration and operational issues and the ability to\nretain management and other key personnel.\nThe generation of electricity from wind and solar energy facilities depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions.\nAlthough our electric generation facilities are located in diverse geographic regions to reduce the potential impact that may be caused by unfavorable\nweather in a particular region, suitable meteorological conditions are variable and difficult to predict. If wind or solar conditions are unfavorable or\nmeteorological conditions are unsuitable, electricity generation and revenue from wind and solar energy facilities may be substantially below our\nexpectations. The electricity produced, production tax credits received, and revenues generated by a wind or solar energy facility are highly dependent on\nsuitable wind conditions and associated weather conditions, which are variable and beyond our control. We base our decisions about which wind and solar\nprojects to build or acquire as well as our electricity generation estimates, in part, on the findings of long-term wind and other meteorological studies\nconducted on the project site and its region; however, the unpredictable nature of wind and solar conditions, weather and meteorological conditions can\nresult in material deviations from these studies and our expectations. Furthermore, components of our systems could be damaged by severe weather, such\nas hailstorms, lightning or tornadoes. In addition, replacement and spare parts for key components may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be\nunavailable. Unfavorable wind and solar conditions, weather or changes to meteorological patterns could impair the effectiveness of our electric generation\nfacility assets, reduce their output beneath their rated capacity or require shutdown of key equipment, impeding operation of our wind energy facilities or\nlead to an impairment of assets.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n30\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks (Continued)\nThe construction, operation and maintenance of our electric generation facilities or investment in facilities are subject to operational risks that\ncould adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe construction and operation of generating facilities involves many risks, including the performance by key contracted suppliers and maintenance\nproviders; increases in the costs for or limited availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services; start-up operations risks; breakdown or failure of\nfacilities; curtailment of facilities by counterparties or due to inadequate transmission capacity; the dependence on the availability of wind resources; or the\nimpact of unusual, adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.\nSome of our facilities contain older generating equipment, which even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant\ncapital expenditures to continue operating at peak efficiency. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce and deliver\npower, including failure caused by breakdown or forced outage, as well as the repair of damage to facilities due to storms, natural disasters, wars, sabotage,\nterrorist acts and other catastrophic events.\nThe price of electricity may be volatile, which may impact results of operations at ALLETE Clean Energy wind energy facilities under contracts\nwith commercial and industrial (C&I) customers.\nUnusual, adverse weather conditions or other natural events and different settlement prices between hub and node can cause volatility in market prices for\nelectricity and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ALLETE Clean Energy’s power sales agreements with C&I\ncustomers at its Diamond Spring and Caddo wind energy facilities are contracts for differences where power is delivered to the market, a fixed price is paid\nby the customers to ALLETE Clean Energy, and differences between the market price and the fixed price are paid to or received from the customers.\nCertain contracts also settle with the market at the hub price whereas ALLETE Clean Energy settles with the customer at the node price which can vary\nsignificantly based on multiple factors. These settlement provisions can result in an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash\nflows when market prices are volatile, or lead to potential impairment of property, plant and equipment if these conditions persist for an extended period of\ntime.\nAs contracts with counterparties expire, we may not be able to replace them with agreements on similar terms or divest the related assets at a\nprofit.\nALLETE Clean Energy is party to PSAs that expire in various years between 2027 and 2039. These PSA expirations are prior to the end of the estimated\nuseful lives of the respective wind energy facilities. If, for any reason, ALLETE Clean Energy is unable to enter into new agreements with existing or new\ncounterparties on similar terms once the current agreements expire, sell energy in the wholesale market resulting in similar revenue, or enter into a contract\nto sell the facility at a profit, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected, which includes potential impairment of\nproperty, plant and equipment.\nCounterparties to turbine and other generation supply, service and maintenance, or power sale agreements may not fulfill their obligations.\nOur businesses are party to turbine and other generation supply agreements, service and maintenance agreements, and PSAs under various durations with a\nlimited number of creditworthy counterparties. If, for any reason, any of the counterparties under these agreements do not fulfill their related contractual\nobligations, and we are unable to mitigate non-performance by a key supplier or maintenance provider or remarket PSA energy resulting in similar revenue,\nour financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nALLETE has a significant amount of goodwill. A determination that goodwill has been impaired could result in a significant non-cash charge to\nearnings.\nWe had approximately $155 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024, related to New Energy. If we\nchange our business strategy, fail to deliver on our projected results or if market or other conditions adversely affect the operations of New Energy, we may\nbe required to record an impairment charge. Declines in projected operating cash flows at New Energy could also result in an impairment charge. An\nimpairment charge would result in a non-cash charge to earnings that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n31\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy / Corporate and Other Risks (Continued)\nBNI Energy may be adversely impacted by its exposure to customer concentration, and environmental laws and regulations.\nBNI Energy sells lignite coal to two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, and could be adversely impacted if these\ncustomers were unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations, or change the way in which they operate their generating facilities. In\naddition, BNI Energy and its customers may be adversely impacted by existing or new environmental laws and regulations which could have an adverse\neffect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, insurance companies have decreased the available coverage for policy\nholders in the mining industry, impacting the availability of coverage, and leading to higher deductibles and premiums.\nReal estate market conditions where our legacy Florida real estate investment is located may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s strategy related to the real estate assets of ALLETE Properties incorporates the possibility of a bulk sale of its entire portfolio, in addition\nto sales over time, however, adverse market conditions could impact the timing of land sales, which could result in little to no sales, while still incurring\noperating expenses such as community development district assessments and property taxes, resulting in net operating losses at ALLETE Properties.\nFurthermore, weak market conditions could put the properties at risk for an impairment charge. An impairment charge would result in a non-cash charge to\nearnings that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEntity-wide Risks\nWe could be materially adversely affected by health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks.\nHealth epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, as well as the related federal and state government responses, can have widespread impacts on the\neconomy and on our employees, customers, contractors and suppliers, such as those experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be uncertainty\nregarding the length of time an epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak will last, how they will evolve, or the extent and duration of any measures attempted\nto try and contain them.\nA disruption of economic activity or an extended disruption of economic activity may lead to adverse impacts on our taconite, paper, pulp and secondary\nwood products, and pipeline customers’ operations including reduced production or the temporary idling or indefinite shutdown of facilities, which would\nresult in lower sales and revenue from these customers. A disruption in capital markets could lead to increased borrowing costs or adversely impact our\nability to access capital markets or other financing sources, which would adversely affect our ability to maintain our businesses or to implement our\nbusiness plans. An epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak may also result in a disruption to our supply chains which could adversely impact our operations\nand capital projects resulting in project and operational delays, project cancellations, lower returns on projects and cost increases.\nDespite any efforts made to mitigate the impacts on the Company of an epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak, their ultimate impact also depends on factors\nbeyond our control, including their duration and severity as well as governmental and third-party actions taken to contain their spread and mitigate their\npublic health effects. As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of an epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and\nwhether it will have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on access to financing sources and capital markets. If we do not have access to capital on acceptable terms or are unable to obtain capital\nwhen needed, our ability to execute our business plans, make capital expenditures or pursue other strategic actions that we may otherwise rely on\nfor future growth would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on access to financing sources and the capital markets, on acceptable terms and at reasonable costs, as sources of liquidity for capital requirements\nnot satisfied by our cash flows from operations. Rising interest rates, inflation and market disruptions or a downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the\ncost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access and finance in the capital markets or to access other financing sources such as tax equity\nfinancing. Such disruptions or causes of a downgrade could include but are not limited to: weakening of the Company’s cash flow metrics; a loss of, or a\nreduction in sales to, our taconite, paper and pipeline customers if we are unable to offset the related lost margins; weaker operating performance; adverse\nregulatory outcomes; disproportionate increase in the contribution to net income from ALLETE Clean Energy and our Corporate and Other businesses as\ncompared to that from our Regulated Operations; deteriorating economic or capital market conditions; or volatility in commodity prices.  \nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n32\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nEntity-wide Risks (Continued)\nIf we are not able to access capital on acceptable terms in sufficient amounts and when needed, or at all, the ability to maintain our businesses or to\nimplement our business plans would be adversely affected. This would include our ability to make the significant capital expenditures planned in order to\nachieve Minnesota Power’s clean-energy transition plans. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations – Capital Requirements.)\nA deterioration in general economic conditions, an inflationary environment or supply chain disruptions may have adverse impacts on our\nfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, we experience an inflationary environment or supply chains are disrupted on a national, regional or global level, it may\nhave a negative impact on our customers and the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This impact may include volatility and\nunpredictability in the demand for the products and services offered by our businesses, the loss of existing customers, tempered growth strategies, customer\nproduction cutbacks, customer bankruptcies and increases in costs for or limited availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services for our operations\nand capital projects. An uncertain economy could also adversely affect expenses including pension costs, interest costs, and uncollectible accounts, or lead\nto reductions in the value of certain real estate and other investments.\nOur utility infrastructure and generating facilities, ongoing and future capital and development projects, and other operations require components, supplies,\nmaterials, labor and services sourced from suppliers or providers who, in turn, may source components from their suppliers. A shortage of key components,\nsupplies, materials, labor or services in which an alternative supplier or provider is not identified could significantly impact project plans or our operations.\nSuch impacts could include project delays, including potential for project cancellation, lower project returns, increased costs or the inability to provide\nservice to customers, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy or changes\nin taxes, tariffs, duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate and deliver it.\nAny reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy, or the imposition of additional\nor increased sourcing of components subject to taxes, tariffs, duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate and\ndeliver it, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development or financing of new renewable energy projects and\nreduced project returns on current or future projects.\nThe U.S. government currently imposes anti-dumping and countervailing duties on certain imported photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules from China and\nTaiwan. Such duties can change over time pursuant to annual reviews conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). On August 18, 2023, the\nU.S. DOC issued a final affirmative determination that imports of certain PV cells and modules assembled and completed in Cambodia, Malaysia,\nThailand, and Vietnam are circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duties. Duties were not collected on imports before June 2024 as a result of a\ntemporary duty suspension ordered by the U.S. President. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if this U.S. DOC circumvention determination\nresults in duties assessed on future purchases made by our businesses after the current moratorium ends, or if additional anti-dumping and countervailing\nduties are imposed by the U.S. government on products purchased by our businesses.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n33\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nEntity-wide Risks (Continued)\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in governmental policy related to taxes, tariffs and duties, as well as grants and\nother incentives.\nOur business, investments and customers could be adversely affected by the direct and indirect effects of recently proposed and new tariffs, or changes in\nexisting tariffs, on purchases from suppliers located outside of the U.S. or suppliers with products sourced from outside of the U.S.\nMinnesota Power has PPAs that provide for the purchase of capacity and energy from Manitoba Hydro in Canada and also purchases other energy and\ncapacity through MISO or under bilateral contracts with other power suppliers that may be sourced from outside of the U.S. A portion of SWL&P’s natural\ngas purchases for resale in its regulated service territory is also sourced from Canada. In addition, the Company has various other agreements for the\npurchase of equipment and other components for use in our operations or capital projects that may be sourced from outside the U.S. We are evaluating the\nimpact of proposed tariffs on our operations, capital projects and purchases from and agreements with suppliers.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) previously awarded grants on two transmission projects that are currently under various stages of development.\n(See Outlook – Transmission – North Plains Connector Development Agreement and HVDC Transmission System Project.) These projects could be\nmaterially affected by changes in DOE’s funding policies.\nOur businesses, investments and customers are subject to extensive state and federal legislation and regulation, compliance with which could have\nan adverse effect on our businesses.\nOur businesses, investments and customers are subject to, and affected by, extensive state and federal legislation and regulation. If it was determined that\nour businesses failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or be required to implement additional\ncompliance measures or actions, the cost of which could be material. If we are unable to obtain all required permits and approvals for our development\nprojects, it could negatively impact our ability to execute on our EnergyForward strategy. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, public\npolicy positions or practices and their interpretations by federal and state agencies, or changes to or a failure to comply with current laws, rules, regulations,\nprinciples, public policy positions or practices and their interpretations, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows.\nThe inability to attract and retain a qualified workforce including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with\nspecialized skills, could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe success of our business heavily depends on the leadership of our executive officers and key employees to implement our business strategy. The\ninability to maintain a qualified workforce, including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with specialized skills, may\nnegatively affect our ability to service our existing or new customers, or successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Personnel\ncosts may increase due to competitive pressures, inflation or terms of collective bargaining agreements with union employees.\nMarket performance and other changes could decrease the value of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, which may result in\nsignificant additional funding requirements and increased annual expenses.\nThe performance of the capital markets impacts the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations to these plans and the trusts hold significant assets. These assets are subject to market\nfluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of the pension and other\npostretirement benefit plan assets would increase the funding requirements under our benefit plans if asset returns do not recover. Additionally, our pension\nand other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially\nincreasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs are generally recoverable in our electric rates\nas allowed by our regulators or through our cost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements at BNI Energy; however, there is no certainty that regulators will\ncontinue to allow recovery of these rising costs in the future.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n34\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nEntity-wide Risks (Continued)\nWe are exposed to significant reputational risk.\nThe Company could suffer negative impacts to its reputation as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate compliance policies, such as our\ncode of business conduct, by employees, directors of ALLETE, contractors, vendors and others who do business with or on behalf of ALLETE, regulatory\nviolations, operations that produce or enable the production of GHG emissions or other events which may result in negative customer perception, increased\nregulatory oversight, and negative consequences to our credit ratings and ability to access capital, each of which could have an adverse effect on our\nfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other catastrophic events, such as natural disasters and acts of\nwar.\nCatastrophic events at or near Company facilities and equipment on which the Company depends upon or that otherwise impact the Company such as fires,\nwildfires, including the impact to Company facilities and operations or potential liability if caused by Company equipment, earthquakes, explosions, and\nfloods, severe weather, such as ice storms, hailstorms, or tornadoes or similar occurrences, as well as acts of war, could adversely affect the Company’s\nfacilities, operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although the Company has contingency plans and employs crisis management\nto respond and recover operations in the event of a severe disruption resulting from a catastrophic event, these measures may not be successful.\nFurthermore, despite these measures, if a catastrophic event were to occur, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely\naffected.\nThe scientific community generally accepts that emissions of GHG are linked to global climate change. Physical risks of climate change, such as more\nfrequent, longer duration or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, increased risk of wildfires, changes to ground\nand surface water availability, and other related phenomena, could affect some, or all, of our operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters could be\ndestructive, which could result in increased costs or limit the availability of key materials, supplies, labor and services used in our operations or to respond\nto damaged facilities. An extreme weather event can also directly affect our capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to facility outages,\ndowned wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment.\nClimate-related risks that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations include effects of environmental- or economic-based laws,\nregulations, incentives or initiatives designed to reduce the quantity or impact of GHG emissions, the ability of our regulated businesses to obtain rate\nadjustments to recover costs and investments to implement clean-energy transition plans, or disruptions to the economy or energy markets caused by\nclimate change. This includes the risk of laws or regulations that create mandates that do not allow for a transition that protects the safety, reliability or\naffordability of energy for our customers, are implemented before cost-effective technology is developed and regulatory policy is established, or require the\nelectric sector to decarbonize faster than other sectors. Additionally, restrictions on land use, wildlife impacts, and other environmental regulations could\naffect the siting, construction and operation of new or existing generation and transmission facilities needed to transition to lower-carbon generation\nsources.\nThese all have the potential to adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe are vulnerable to acts of terrorism or cybersecurity attacks.\nOur operations may be targets of terrorist activities or cybersecurity attacks, which could disrupt our ability to provide utility service at our regulated\nutilities, develop or operate our renewable energy projects at ALLETE Clean Energy, or operate our other businesses. The impacts may also impair the\nfulfillment of critical business functions, negatively impact our reputation, subject us to litigation or increased regulation, or compromise sensitive,\nconfidential and other data.\nThere have been cybersecurity attacks on U.S. energy infrastructure in the past and there may be such attacks in the future. Our generation, transmission\nand distribution facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or otherwise be\nmaterially adversely affected by such activities. Hacking, computer viruses, terrorism, theft and sabotage could impact our systems and facilities, or those\nof third parties on which we rely, which may disrupt our operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n35\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nEntity-wide Risks (Continued)\nOur businesses require the continued operation of sophisticated custom-developed, purchased, and leased information technology systems and network\ninfrastructure as well as the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. Although we\nmaintain security measures designed to prevent cybersecurity incidents and protect our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure\nand other assets, our technology systems, or those of third parties on which we rely, may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to\nhacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism as well as other causes. If those technology systems fail or are breached and not recovered in a timely manner, we\nmay be unable to perform critical business functions including effectively maintaining certain internal controls over financial reporting, our reputation may\nbe negatively impacted, we may become subject to litigation or increased regulation, and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised. If\nour business were impacted by terrorist activities or cybersecurity attacks, such impacts could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties we face.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties we face. The occurrence of these risks and uncertainties, if not fully covered\nby insurance, could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernment challenges to our tax positions, as well as tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of our\noperations and business decisions, could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations in order to estimate our\nobligations to taxing authorities. The obligations, which include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes, involve complex matters that ultimately\ncould be litigated. We also estimate our ability to use tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards and tax credits that are recorded as deferred\ntax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A disallowance of some or all of these tax benefits could have an adverse impact on our financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nWe are currently utilizing, and plan to utilize in the future, our carryforwards and tax credits to reduce our income tax obligations. If we cannot generate\nenough taxable income in the future to utilize all of our carryforwards and tax credits before they expire, we may incur adverse charges to earnings.\nIf federal or state tax authorities deny any deductions or tax credits, negatively change existing tax laws or policies, or fail to extend or renew policies\nbeneficial to the Company, such as those for renewable energy production tax credits, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be\nadversely impacted.\nOur business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected by adverse results of litigation.\nWe are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business. Unfavorable resolution of legal or administrative proceedings in which we are\ninvolved or other future legal or administrative proceedings may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n36\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRisks Relating to the Merger\nOn May 5, 2024, ALLETE entered into the Merger Agreement. (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger.)\nThere is no assurance when or if the Merger will be completed, and there could be an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition or cash flows if the Merger is not completed or is delayed.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including: (1) approval of the shareholders of ALLETE; (2) receipt of all required\nregulatory approvals without the imposition of a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (3) absence of any law or order prohibiting\nthe consummation of the Merger; (4) subject to materiality qualifiers, the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties; (5) each party’s\ncompliance in all material respects with its obligations and covenants under the Merger Agreement; and (6) the absence of a material adverse effect with\nrespect to the Company. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both ALLETE and Alloy Parent, including if the Merger is not\nconsummated by August 5, 2025 (subject to extension for an additional two successive three-month periods if all of the conditions to closing, other than the\nconditions related to obtaining regulatory approvals, have been satisfied). While the shareholders of ALLETE voted to approve and adopt the Merger\nAgreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, at a special meeting of the shareholders that was held on August 21,\n2024, there can be no assurance that the other conditions to completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to\ndelay or result in the failure to close the proposed Merger. The Merger Agreement also provides for certain termination rights for each of ALLETE and\nAlloy Parent. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various material, adverse consequences to the Company, including that the Company\ncould be required to pay Alloy Parent a termination fee of $116 million under certain specified circumstances. If the Merger is not completed or delayed,\nthere may be negative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the price of ALLETE’s common stock due to the fact that the current price\nmay reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger, during which the Company is subject to certain operating restrictions, could have an adverse\neffect on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could disrupt the Company’s businesses, and uncertainty about the effect of the Merger may have an\nadverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties could affect existing employee relationships, disrupt the business of the Company, and could cause\nsuppliers, vendors, partners, lenders and others that deal with the Company to: (1) defer entering into contracts with the Company; or (2) make other\ndecisions concerning the Company or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with the Company.\nThe Merger Agreement also requires the Company to obtain Parent’s consent prior to taking certain specified actions while the Merger is pending. These\nrestrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or making other changes to its business prior to the\ncompletion of the Merger.\nThe Company will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger.\nThe Company has incurred transaction costs of $22.6 million after-tax through December 31, 2024, and expects to incur additional material expenses in\nconnection with the Merger and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Further, even if the proposed Merger is not\ncompleted, the Company will need to pay certain costs relating to the proposed Merger incurred prior to the date the proposed Merger was abandoned, such\nas legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n37\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nRisks Relating to the Merger (Continued)\nPending litigation related to the Merger could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits\nare without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs to us and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff\nis successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being\ncompleted. A complaint has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, disclosure deficiency in the Preliminary Proxy, and seeking to enjoin the transaction until certain disclosures are\ncorrected. On September 3, 2024, that complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Two additional complaints were filed on August 6, 2024, and\nAugust 7, 2024, in New York State Supreme Court, alleging negligent misrepresentation and negligence related to alleged deficiencies in the Preliminary\nProxy. Those complaints have not been served on any defendant. The Company believes that the complaints are without merit.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nALLETE employs a multilayer approach to addressing cybersecurity risk based on the NIST framework. It has established a dedicated cybersecurity team\nthat utilizes internal and external assessments, automated monitoring tools, and input from public and private partners to identify potential cyber threats.\nExternal third-party security firms are engaged to assist with cybersecurity risk assessments, penetration testing and system security analysis. ALLETE’s\ncybersecurity team works in conjunction with the risk management, legal, finance, accounting, operations, and information technology areas to assess the\nrisk these identified cybersecurity threats present to the organization. To ensure consistency, these cybersecurity risk assessments are incorporated into\nALLETE’s Enterprise Risk Management process, ALLETE’s information technology leadership reviews the company’s enterprise risk management-level\ncybersecurity risks on a quarterly basis, and key cybersecurity risks are incorporated into ALLETE’s enterprise risk management framework. Cybersecurity\nrisks are managed and controlled through multiple overlapping layers of cybersecurity defenses that include:\n•expert input from both public and private partnerships;\n•the implementation of a comprehensive cybersecurity policy that encompasses but is not limited to social media, acceptable use (devices, wireless,\nremote access, internet use), information governance, monitoring, authentication, encryption, vulnerability management, third-party management,\nand recovery;\n•required annual cybersecurity training for all employees with additional supplemental cybersecurity training required based on role;\n•random employee phish testing and follow-up;\n•procedural and automated cyber controls in conjunction with robust detection, mitigation, and recovery capabilities;\n•the integration of multiple threat intelligence sources into our cybersecurity tools and processes;\n•the retention of external cybersecurity threat response resources;\n•the formation of a multidisciplinary cybersecurity incident response team; and\n•multiple cyber event simulation and tabletop exercises per year to hone the cybersecurity incident response team preparedness.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n38\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity (Continued)\nThe ALLETE board of directors provides enterprise-level oversight of risks associated with cybersecurity threats through the Audit Committee, which\nassists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding the Company’s policies and processes with respect to risk assessment and risk\nmanagement, including any significant non-financial risk exposures; reviewing and discussing the Company’s information security policies and internal\ncontrols regarding information security; and reviewing the Company’s annual disclosures concerning the role of the Board in the risk oversight of the\nCompany. The Audit Committee performs an annual review of the Company’s cybersecurity program and receives quarterly updates on key cybersecurity\nrisks, the cybersecurity risk management plan, and cyber incident event trends.\nALLETE’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) has primary responsibility for the development and oversight of ALLETE’s cybersecurity team and the\ndevelopment and maintenance of the company’s related cybersecurity policies and procedures. The CTO has over 25 years’ experience working in the\ninformation and operational technology field and is a registered professional engineer in the State of Minnesota. The company’s cybersecurity team\ncontinuously assesses the evolving cyber threat landscape based on their expertise and that of our third-party partners. They then work with all parts of\nALLETE to protect against, detect, identify, respond to, and recover from the risks that cybersecurity threats present. The cybersecurity team views and\nresponds to cybersecurity risks in a holistic manner, applying a comprehensive multilayered strategy to prevent, detect, and mitigate them. They have\nidentified ALLETE’s critical cyber assets and taken appropriate steps to protect them. External expertise is regularly engaged to assess ALLETE’s\ncybersecurity program and help the cybersecurity team to strengthen the organization’s monitoring, alerting, prevention, mitigation, and recovery\ncapabilities. Tabletop simulations, third-party cyber vulnerability assessments, maturity assessments, and partnerships are used to assess and refine all\nelements of our cybersecurity program.\nIn addition to managing our own cybersecurity preparedness, we also consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with the use of third-party\nservice providers. Risk assessments are performed against third-party service providers with a specific focus on any sensitive data that is to be shared with\nthem. The internal business owners of ALLETE’s applications are required to document user access reviews regularly. We request a System and\nOrganizational Controls (SOC) 2 report from the vendors of our enterprise cloud applications. If they do not provide us with a SOC 2, we seek additional\ncompensating risk assurance in our contract language with them. Risks associated with the use of third-party service providers are managed as part of our\noverall cybersecurity risk management framework.\nTo continually manage and control the material risks that cybersecurity threats present to the organization, ALLETE invests significantly in the\ncybersecurity elements outlined above. In addition, the Company has made significant investments to fulfill the operational and financial regulatory\nrequirements laid out by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards and Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nALLETE faces a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with its business. Although we believe such risks have not materially affected us, including\nour business strategy, results of operations, and financial conditions, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to and breaches of our data systems,\nincluding malware, phishing and computer virus attacks. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding our organization’s cybersecurity\nrisks, which should be read together with this Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n39\nItem 2. Properties\nA discussion of our properties is included in Item 1. Business and is incorporated by reference herein.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nDiscussions of material regulatory and environmental proceedings are included in Note 4. Regulatory Matters and Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and\nContingencies, and are incorporated by reference herein.\nWe are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business. Also in the normal course of business, we are involved in tax, regulatory and other\ngovernmental audits, inspections, investigations and other proceedings that involve state and federal taxes, safety, and compliance with regulations, rate\nbase and cost of service issues, among other things. We do not expect the outcome of these matters to have a material effect on our financial position,\nresults of operations or cash flows.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires issuers to include in periodic reports filed with the SEC\ncertain information relating to citations or orders for violations of standards under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Safety Act).\nInformation concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and this Item are included in\nExhibit 95 to this Form 10-K.\nPart II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol ALE. We have paid dividends, without interruption, on our common stock since 1948. A\nquarterly dividend of $0.73 per share on our common stock is payable on March 1, 2025, to the shareholders of record on February 14, 2025. The timing\nand amount of future dividends will depend upon earnings, cash requirements, the financial condition of the Company, applicable government regulations\nand other factors deemed relevant by the ALLETE Board of Directors. As of February 1, 2025, there were approximately 17,000 common stock\nshareholders of record. On May 5, 2024, ALLETE entered into the Merger Agreement. (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger.)\nWe do not have a publicly announced stock repurchase program and we did not repurchase any equity securities during the quarter ended December 31,\n2024. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company cannot repurchase shares of common stock, subject to limited exceptions, without the prior written\nconsent of Alloy Parent. (See Note 15.

The S&P 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic\neconomy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. Because this composite index has a broad industry\nbase, its performance may not closely track that of a composite index comprised solely of electric utilities. The Philadelphia Utility Index is a\ncapitalization-weighted index of 20 utility companies involved in the generation of electricity.\nThe calculations assume a $100 investment on December 31, 2019, and reinvestment of dividends.\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nALLETE $100 $80 $88 $90 $89 $99\nS&P 500 Index $100 $118 $152 $125 $157 $197\nPhiladelphia Utility Index $100 $103 $121 $122 $111 $134\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n41\nItem 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes to those statements and the other financial\ninformation appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Form 10-K contain\nforward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction\nwith our disclosures in this Form 10-K under the headings: “Forward ‑ Looking Statements” located on page 7 and “Risk Factors” located in Item 1A. The\nrisks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not presently\naware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could\nsuffer if the risks are realized.\nOverview\nBasis of Presentation. We present two reportable segments: Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. Our segments were determined in\naccordance with the guidance on segment reporting. We measure performance of our operations through budgeting and monitoring of contributions to\nconsolidated net income by each business segment.\nRegulated Operations includes our regulated utilities, Minnesota Power and SWL&P, as well as our investment in ATC, a Wisconsin-based regulated\nutility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. Minnesota Power provides\nregulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately 150,000 retail customers. Minnesota Power also has 14 non-affiliated\nmunicipal customers in Minnesota. SWL&P is a Wisconsin utility and a wholesale customer of Minnesota Power. SWL&P provides regulated utility\nelectric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately 15,000 electric customers, 13,000 natural gas customers and\n10,000 water customers. Our regulated utility operations include retail and wholesale activities under the jurisdiction of state and federal regulatory\nauthorities. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns,\noperates, or has developed more than 1,600 megawatts of wind energy generation in five major energy markets and eight states across the U.S. with a\nmajority contracted under PSAs of various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate\nunder long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion.\nCorporate and Other is comprised of New Energy, a renewable development company; our investment in Nobles 2, an entity that owns and operates a\n250 MW wind energy facility in southwestern Minnesota; South Shore Energy, our non-rate regulated, Wisconsin subsidiary developing NTEC, an\napproximately 600 MW proposed combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating facility; BNI Energy, our coal mining operations in North Dakota; ALLETE\nProperties, our legacy Florida real estate investment; other business development and corporate expenditures; unallocated interest expense; a small amount\nof non-rate base generation; land holdings in Minnesota; and earnings on cash and investments.\nALLETE is incorporated under the laws of Minnesota. Our corporate headquarters are in Duluth, Minnesota. Statistical information is presented as of\nDecember 31, 2024, unless otherwise indicated. All subsidiaries are wholly-owned unless otherwise specifically indicated. References in this report to\n“we,” “us” and “our” are to ALLETE and its subsidiaries, collectively.\nOn May 5, 2024, ALLETE entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, on and subject to the conditions set forth therein,\nAlloy Merger Sub will merge with and into ALLETE, with ALLETE continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and becoming a subsidiary of\nAlloy Parent. (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n42\n2024 Financial Overview\nThe following net income discussion summarizes a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2024, to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNet income attributable to ALLETE in 2024 was $179.3 million, or $3.10 per diluted share, compared to $247.1 million, or $4.30 per diluted share, in\n2023. Net income in 2024 includes transaction expenses of $22.6 million after-tax, or $0.39 per share, related to the Merger. (See Note 15. Agreement and\nPlan of Merger.) Net income in 2023 included transaction expenses of $3.6 million after-tax, or $0.06 per share, related to the Merger and a $40.5 million,\nor $0.71 per share, after-tax gain recognized for a favorable arbitration ruling involving a subsidiary of ALLETE Clean Energy. (See Note 9. Commitments,\nGuarantees and Contingencies.) Earnings per share dilution in 2024 was $0.02 due to additional shares of common stock outstanding in 2024 compared to\n2023.\nRegulated Operations net income attributable to ALLETE was $160.9 million in 2024, compared to $147.2 million in 2023. Net income at Minnesota\nPower was higher compared to 2023 reflecting the implementation of interim rates on January 1, 2024, net of reserves related to Minnesota Power’s rate\ncase settlement (see Note 4. Regulatory Matters), and higher transmission margins, which were partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax\nexpenses as well as lower margins from industrial customers. Net income at SWL&P was lower than 2023 primarily due to higher operating and\nmaintenance expenses. Our after-tax equity earnings in ATC were higher than 2023 reflecting period over period changes in ATC’s estimate of a refund\nliability related to the FERC decision on MISO return on equity complaints in 2024. (See Note 6. Equity Investments.)\nALLETE Clean Energy net income attributable to ALLETE was $17.8 million in 2024 compared to $71.7 million in 2023. Net income in 2024 includes a\n$3.5 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Whitetail wind project. Net income in 2023 reflected a $44.3 million after-tax gain recognized for a favorable\narbitration ruling involving a subsidiary of ALLETE Clean Energy. Net income in 2023 also included the gain on sale of the Red Barn project in 2023 of\n$4.3 million after-tax and higher interest income related to interest awarded as part of the arbitration ruling. Net income in 2024 and 2023 reflected a forced\noutage located near its Caddo wind energy facility beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023 through the second quarter of 2024 resulting in lower earnings.\nCorporate and Other net income attributable to ALLETE was $0.6 million in 2024 compared to $28.2 million in 2023. Net income in 2024 includes\ntransaction expenses of $22.6 million after-tax related to the Merger (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger), and also reflects lower earnings from\nMinnesota solar projects as investment tax credits were recognized in 2023 for the projects and lower earnings from ALLETE Properties reflecting fewer\nland sales in 2024 compared to 2023. Net income in 2023 reflects a $3.8 million after-tax expense for the consolidated income tax impact resulting from\nthe gain on the favorable arbitration ruling. Net income at New Energy was $20.2 million in 2024 compared to $17.6 million in 2023.\n2024 Compared to 2023\n(See Note 14.

These increases were partially offset by lower transmission revenue, kWh sales and gas sales as well as a\nreduction related to the expected utilization of North Dakota investment tax credits.\nInterim retail rates for Minnesota Power, subject to refund, were approved by the MPUC and became effective January 1, 2024, resulting in revenue of\n$41.1 million, net of reserves related to Minnesota Power’s rate case settlement and rider revenue incorporated into base rates. (See Note 4. Regulatory\nMatters.)\nFuel adjustment clause revenue increased $3.4 million due to higher fuel and purchased power costs attributable to retail and municipal customers.\n(See Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas – Utility.)\nLower kWh sales decreased revenue by $15.3 million from 2023 reflecting lower sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers as well as\nlower sales to other power suppliers. Sales to residential and commercial customers decreased from 2023 primarily due to milder weather in 2024\ncompared to 2023. Sales to industrial customers decreased primarily due to lower sales to taconite and pipeline customers, partially offset by higher\nsales to paper, pulp and secondary wood product customers. Sales to other power suppliers, which are sold at market-based prices into the MISO\nmarket on a daily basis or through PSAs of various durations, decreased reflecting fewer market sales, partially offset by higher market prices in 2024\ncompared to 2023.\n \nKilowatt-hours Sold 2024 2023Quantity\nVariance%\nVariance\nMillions     \nRegulated Utility     \nRetail and Municipal     \nResidential 1,069 1,089 (20) (1.8)\nCommercial 1,322 1,347 (25) (1.9)\nIndustrial 7,022 7,044 (22) (0.3)\nMunicipal 469 466 3 0.6 \nTotal Retail and Municipal 9,882 9,946 (64) (0.6)\nOther Power Suppliers 2,680 2,819 (139) (4.9)\nTotal Regulated Utility Kilowatt-hours Sold 12,562 12,765 (203) (1.6)\nRevenue from electric sales to taconite and mining customers accounted for 32 percent of regulated operating revenue in 2024 (32 percent in 2023).\nRevenue from electric sales to paper, pulp and secondary wood product customers accounted for 5 percent of regulated operating revenue in 2024 (5\npercent in 2023). Revenue from electric sales to pipelines and other industrial customers accounted for 11 percent of regulated operating revenue in\n2024 (11 percent in 2023).\nTransmission revenue decreased $13.8 million primarily due to lower MISO-related revenue. Transmission revenue in 2024 included the refund of\nMISO transmission payments that were over collected during 2023. (See Transmission Services – Utility).\nCost recovery rider revenue decreased by $8.1 million from 2023 due to period over period changes in the estimate of North Dakota investment tax\ncredits expected to be utilized by Minnesota Power. If the estimate of North Dakota investment tax credits expected to be utilized by Minnesota Power\nincreases, an income tax benefit is recognized and a corresponding decrease in revenue is recognized to offset the impact of higher North Dakota\ninvestment tax credits on income tax expense.\nRevenue from gas sales at SWL&P decreased $3.7 million reflecting fewer gas sales resulting from warmer winter weather and lower gas prices in\n2024 compared to 2023. (See Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas – Utility.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n44\n2024 Compared to 2023 (Continued)\nRegulated Operations (Continued)\nOperating Expenses decreased $0.2 million from 2023.\nFuel, Purchased Power and Gas – Utility expense decreased $4.6 million, or 1 percent, from 2023 primarily due to lower kWh sales as well as lower\ngas sales and prices. These decreases were partially offset by less company-owned generation in 2024 compared to 2023 resulting in more sales being\nsupplied through higher cost purchased power.\nTransmission Services – Utility expense decreased $23.6 million, or 27 percent, from 2023 primarily due to lower MISO-related expense. Transmission\nServices – Utility expense in 2024 included the refund of MISO transmission payments that were over billed during 2023. (See Operating Revenue –\nUtility).\nOperating and Maintenance expense increased $2.9 million, or 1 percent, from 2023 primarily due to higher salaries and wages, benefit costs, and\ncontract and professional services. These increases were partially offset by a reduction to expense for liquidated damages related to contractor\nunderperformance under a maintenance agreement.\nDepreciation and Amortization expense increased $17.1 million, or 10 percent, from 2023 primarily due to the impact of estimated compliance costs\nrelated to the EPA’s CCR Legacy Impoundment Rule finalized in May 2024 and a higher plant in service balance in 2024.\nTaxes Other than Income Taxes increased $8.0 million, or 18 percent, from 2023 primarily due to higher property tax expense. Property tax expense in\n2023 included the favorable impact of an updated estimate for 2022 property tax expense recorded in 2023.\nInterest Expense increased $2.2 million, or 3 percent, from 2023 primarily due to higher interest rates and interest on Minnesota Power’s reserve for\ninterim rate refunds in 2024.\nEquity Earnings increased $3.4 million, or 15 percent, from 2023 primarily due to period over period changes in ATC’s estimate of a refund liability\nrelated to the FERC decision on MISO return on equity complaints in 2024. (See Note 6. Equity Investments.)\nOther Income increased $3.1 million from 2023 reflecting lower pension and other postretirement benefit plan non-service costs.\nIncome Tax Expense decreased $4.8 million from 2023. This is primarily due to the updated expected future use of North Dakota investment tax\ncredits.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n45\n2024 Compared to 2023 (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy\nYear Ended December 31 2024 2023\nMillions   \nOperating Revenue\nContracts with Customers – Non-utility $79.3 $413.4 \nOther – Non-utility (a) 5.0 5.1 \nCost of Sales – Non-utility 18.3 342.2 \nOperating and Maintenance 46.5 52.1 \nDepreciation and Amortization 57.5 57.5 \nTaxes Other than Income Taxes 10.4 10.0 \nOperating Loss (48.4) (43.3)\nInterest Expense (0.3) (0.8)\nOther Income (b) 7.5 68.0 \nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes (41.2) 23.9 \nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit) (15.6) 2.7 \nNet Income (Loss) (25.6) 21.2 \nNet Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest (b) (43.4) (50.5)\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE $17.8 $71.7 \n(a) Repr esents non-cash amortization of differ ences between contract prices and estimated market prices on assumed PSAs.\n(b) See Note 1.

In addition, operating revenue in 2024 was negatively\nimpacted by a network outage located near Caddo. The network outage began in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulting from a forced outage of a\nsubstation and the transmission lines feeding that substation. This forced outage increased congestion experienced by Caddo resulting in lower kWh\nsales and pricing. The forced outage was resolved in June 2024.

Commitments, Guarantees, and Contingencies.)\nIncome Tax Expense decreased $18.3 million from 2023 primarily due to lower pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023.\nNet Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest decreased $7.1 million from 2023 reflecting lower availability at ALLETE Clean Energy’s tax\nequity financed wind energy facilities resulting from the impacts of a network outage near Caddo and a transformer outage at Diamond Spring. This\ndecrease was partially offset by a higher production tax credit rate, as determined by the Internal Revenue Service, in 2024 compared to 2023.\nCorporate and Other\nOperating Revenue decreased $20.2 million, or 9 percent, from 2023 reflecting lower revenue from New Energy and lower revenue from ALLETE\nProperties reflecting fewer land sales in 2024 compared to 2023.\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE was $0.6 million in 2024 compared to $28.2 million in 2023. Net income in 2024 includes transaction expenses\nof $22.6 million after-tax related to the Merger (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger), and also reflects lower earnings from Minnesota solar\nprojects as investment tax credits were recognized in 2023 for the projects and lower earnings from ALLETE Properties reflecting fewer land sales in\n2024 compared to 2023. Net income in 2023 reflects a $3.8 million after-tax expense for the consolidated income tax impact resulting from the gain on\nthe favorable arbitration ruling. Net income at New Energy was $20.2 million in 2024 compared to $17.6 million in 2023.\nIncome Taxes – Consolidated\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the effective tax rate was an expense of 3.7 percent (expense of 13.5 percent for the year ended December 31,\n2023). The lower effective tax rate for 2024 is primarily due to lower pre-tax income. (See Note 11. Income Tax Expense.)\n2023 Compared to 2022\nThe comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, is included in Management's Discussion in the Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n47\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make various estimates and assumptions\nthat affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates and assumptions may be revised, which may have a material effect\non the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. These policies are discussed with the Audit\nCommittee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis. We believe the following policies are most critical to our business and the understanding of our\nresults of operations.\nRegulatory Accounting. Our regulated utility operations are subject to accounting standards for the effects of certain types of regulation. These standards\nrequire us to reflect the effect of regulatory decisions in our financial statements. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they\nare probable for recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for\nwhich the related costs have not yet been incurred. The Company assesses quarterly whether regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for\nprobability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment and recent\nrate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction. If future recovery or refund of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities\nwould be recognized in current period net income or other comprehensive income. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nPension and Postretirement Health and Life Actuarial Assumptions. We account for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in\naccordance with the accounting standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These standards require the use of several important\nassumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and mortality assumptions, among others, in determining our\nobligations and the annual cost of our pension and other postretirement benefits. In establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we\ndetermine the long-term historical performance of each asset class and adjust these for current economic conditions while utilizing the target allocation of\nour plan assets to forecast the expected long-term rate of return. Our pension asset allocation as of December 31, 2024, was approximately 57 percent\nequity securities, 40 percent fixed income and 3 percent real estate. Our postretirement health and life asset allocation as of December 31, 2024, was\napproximately 67 percent equity securities, and 33 percent fixed income. Equity securities consist of a mix of market capitalization sizes with domestic and\ninternational securities. In 2024, we used weighted average expected long-term rates of return of 6.84 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension\nexpense and 6.28 percent in our actuarial determination of our other postretirement expense. The actuarial determination uses an asset smoothing\nmethodology for actual returns to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. We review our expected long-term rate of return\nassumption annually and will adjust it to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the expected long-term rate of return\nwould increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately $2.1 million, pre-tax.\nThe discount rate is computed using a bond matching study which utilizes a portfolio of high quality bonds that produce cash flows similar to the projected\ncosts of our pension and other postretirement plans. In 2024, we used weighted average discount rates of 5.38 percent and 5.42 percent in our actuarial\ndetermination of our pension and other postretirement expense, respectively. We review our discount rates annually and will adjust them to respond to\nchanging market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement\nbenefits by approximately $0.2 million, pre-tax.\nThe mortality assumptions used to calculate our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024, considered a modified PRI-\n2012 mortality table and MP-2021 mortality projection scale. (See Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)\nValuation of Business Combinations and Resulting Goodwill. When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at\ntheir respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us\nto make significant estimates. These estimates may include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those\ncash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset’s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic and competitive risks.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n48\nCritical Accounting Policies (Continued)\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired businesses.\nIn accordance with GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses whether there has been an impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth\nquarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill\nis done at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting unit. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash\nflows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value. The fair value of the New Energy reporting unit was determined using a discounted\ncash flow model, using significant assumptions which included a discount rate of 12.5 percent, cash flow forecasts through 2033, gross margins, and a\nterminal growth rate of 3.5 percent. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in the forecasted cash flows and other assumptions could\nsignificantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of New Energy. The results of our annual impairment test are discussed in Note 1. Operations\nand Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7. Fair Value in this Form 10-K. Goodwill was $154.9 million as of December 31, 2024.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We review our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for\nproperty, plant and equipment on a quarterly basis.\nIn accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment, if indicators of impairment exist, we test our long-lived assets for\nrecoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Cash flows\nare assessed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The undiscounted future net cash flows are impacted by trends and factors known to us at the\ntime they are calculated and our expectations related to: management’s best estimate of future sales prices; holding period and timing of sales; method of\ndisposition; and future expenditures necessary to maintain the operations. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.)\nTaxation. We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate\nour obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes. Judgments related to income taxes\nrequire the recognition in our financial statements of the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained on audit. Tax\npositions that do not meet the “more-likely-than-not” criteria are reflected as a tax liability in accordance with the accounting standards for uncertainty in\nincome taxes. We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred\ntax assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. We make assumptions and judgments each reporting period to estimate our income tax assets,\nliabilities, benefits and expenses. Judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections. Our assumptions and judgments\ninclude the application of tax statutes and regulations, and projections of future federal taxable income, state taxable income, and state apportionment to\ndetermine our ability to utilize NOL and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Significant changes in assumptions regarding future federal and state\ntaxable income or a change in tax rates could require new or increased valuation allowances which could result in a material impact on our results of\noperations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n49\nOutlook\nALLETE is an energy company committed to earning a financial return that rewards our shareholders, allows for reinvestment in our businesses, and\nsustains growth. The Company has a long-term objective of achieving consolidated earnings per share growth within a range of 5 percent to 7 percent.\nALLETE is predominately a regulated utility through Minnesota Power, SWL&P, and an investment in ATC. ALLETE’s strategy is to remain\npredominately a regulated utility while investing in ALLETE Clean Energy, New Energy and its Corporate and Other businesses to complement its\nregulated businesses, balance exposure to the utility’s industrial customers, and provide potential long-term earnings growth. ALLETE expects net income\nfrom Regulated Operations to be approximately 75 percent of total consolidated net income in 2025. ALLETE expects its businesses to generally provide\nregulated, contracted or recurring revenues, and to support sustained growth in net income and cash flow.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. We believe our businesses will benefit from certain provisions of this law including from\nthe extension and transferability of production tax credits and investment tax credits, among others. We have sold certain tax credits generated in 2023 and\n2024, and we plan to continue selling certain tax credits generated in 2025 and beyond. We do not currently anticipate any impact from the new alternative\nminimum tax. We will continue to assess the impact of the law as additional implementation guidance becomes available and monitor any changes related\nto new public policies.\nMinnesota Carbon-Free Legislation. On February 7, 2023, the Minnesota Governor signed a law that updated the state’s renewable energy standard and\nrequires Minnesota electric utilities to source retail sales with 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The law increases the renewable energy standard\nfrom 25 percent renewable by 2025 to 55 percent renewable by 2035, and requires investor-owned Minnesota utilities to provide 80 percent carbon-free\nenergy by 2030, 90 percent carbon-free energy by 2035 and 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. The law utilizes renewable energy credits as the\nmeans to demonstrate compliance with both the carbon-free and renewable standards, includes an off-ramp provision that enables the MPUC to protect\nreliability and customer costs through modification or delay of either the renewable energy standard, the carbon-free standard, or both, and streamlines\ndevelopment and construction of wind energy projects and transmission in Minnesota. Ongoing progress towards compliance with Minnesota's Carbon\nFree Standard is evaluated in the IRP proceedings at the MPUC. Minnesota Power's next IRP will be filed in March 2025 and discuss progress towards\ncompliance with the 2040 law.\nRegulated Operations. Minnesota Power’s long-term strategy is to be the leading electric energy provider in northeastern Minnesota by providing safe,\nreliable and cost-competitive electric energy, while complying with environmental permit conditions and renewable energy requirements. Keeping the cost\nof energy production competitive enables Minnesota Power to effectively compete in the wholesale power markets and minimizes retail rate increases to\nhelp maintain customer viability. As part of maintaining cost competitiveness, Minnesota Power intends to reduce its exposure to possible future carbon\nand GHG legislation by reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal. Minnesota Power is making significant progress toward\n100 percent carbon-free energy supply. (See EnergyForward.) We will monitor and review proposed environmental regulations and may challenge those\nthat add considerable cost with limited environmental benefit. Minnesota Power will continue to pursue customer growth opportunities and cost recovery\nrider approvals for transmission, renewable and environmental investments, as well as work with regulators to earn a fair rate of return.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n50\nOutlook (Continued)\nRegulatory Matters. Entities within our Regulated Operations segment are under the jurisdiction of the MPUC, FERC, PSCW and NDPSC. See Note 4.\nRegulatory Matters for discussion of regulatory matters within these jurisdictions.\n2024 Minnesota General Rate Case. On November 1, 2023, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average\nincrease of approximately 12.00 percent for retail customers, net of rider revenue incorporated into base rates. The rate filing sought a return on equity of\n10.30 percent and a 53.00 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would have generated approximately $89 million in\nadditional revenue. In separate orders dated December 19, 2023, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and approved an annual interim rate increase of\napproximately $64 million, net of rider revenue, beginning January 1, 2024, subject to refund.\nOn May 3, 2024, Minnesota Power entered into a settlement agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Minnesota Office of the Attorney\nGeneral, Residential Utilities Division, and Large Power Intervenors to settle the retail rate increase request. As part of the settlement agreement, the parties\nagreed on all issues, including an overall rate increase of $33.97 million, net of rider revenue and amounts transferring to the fuel adjustment clause, a\nreturn on equity of 9.78 percent, an equity ratio of 53.00 percent, all non-financial items and cost allocation. In an order dated November 25, 2024, the\nMPUC approved the settlement agreement. Final rates are expected to be implemented in the first quarter of 2025; interim rates will be collected through\nthis period with reserves recorded as necessary. As a result of the settlement, Minnesota Power recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund of\n$23.0 million pre-tax as of December 31, 2024, which is subject to MPUC approval of Minnesota Power’s refund calculation.\n2022 Minnesota General Rate Case. Minnesota Power appealed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals (Court) specific aspects of the MPUC’s February\n2023 and May 2023 rate case orders for the ratemaking treatment of Taconite Harbor and Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset. On September 9, 2024,\nthe Court affirmed the MPUC’s Taconite Harbor treatment, but reversed and remanded the treatment of Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset back to\nthe MPUC. The Court directed the MPUC to determine the amount of Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset to be included in rate base. The MPUC has\nnot yet determined the next procedural steps in implementing the Court’s decision.\n2024 Wisconsin General Rate Case. On March 29, 2024, SWL&P filed a rate increase request for its electric, gas and water utilities with the PSCW. The\nfiling sought an overall return on equity of 10.00 percent and a 55.00 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested change would increase\nrates by approximately 5.90 percent for retail customers and generate an estimated $7.3 million of additional revenue. In an order dated December 12,\n2024, the PSCW approved an annual increase of approximately $5.5 million reflecting a return on equity of 9.80 percent and a 55.00 percent equity ratio.\nFinal rates went into effect January 1, 2025.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n51\nOutlook (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers. Electric power is one of several key inputs in the taconite mining, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, pipeline and other\nindustries. Approximately 56 percent of our regulated utility kWh sales in 2024 (55 percent in 2023 and 52 percent in 2022) were made to our industrial\ncustomers. We expect industrial sales of approximately 6.9 million MWh in 2025 (7.0 million MWh in 2024 and 7.0 million MWh in 2023). (See Item 1.\nBusiness – Regulated Operations – Electric Sales / Customers.)\nTaconite. Minnesota Power’s taconite customers are capable of producing up to approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets\nproduced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steelmaking facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry, which continue to lead\nthe world in environmental performance among steelmaking countries. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, steel production in the U.S. is the\nmost energy efficient of any major steel producing country. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of\nautomobiles, appliances, tubular applications for all industries, and in the construction industry. Steel is also a critical component of the clean energy\ntransformation underway today. Meeting the demand for more renewable energy and the need for additional infrastructure to transport green energy from\nthe point of generation to the end user both require steel. Historically, approximately 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside\nof North America.\nThere has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an\nassociation of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 76 percent of capacity in 2024 (75\npercent in 2023 and 78 percent in 2022). The World Steel Association, an association of steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations,\nand steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2025 will increase by\napproximately 2 percent compared to 2024.\nMinnesota Power’s taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term\ndemand changes or maintenance outages. The Minnesota Department of Revenue Mineral Tax Office expects taconite production from our taconite\ncustomers to be approximately 34 million tons in 2025. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power’s taconite customers’ production\nwould impact our annual earnings per share by approximately $0.07, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric\nprices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets\nthat is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a\npermanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue.\nUSS Corporation. USS Corporation completed a $150 million investment to produce direct reduced-grade (DR-grade) pellets at its Keetac plant in late\n2023. USS Corporation broke ground on the project in the third quarter of 2022, and confirmed the first shipment of DR-grade pellets in 2024. This\ninvestment enables the existing pelletizing plant to not only create DR-grade pellets for use as a feedstock for a direct reduced iron (DRI) or hot briquetted\niron (HBI) process that ultimately supplies electric arc furnace steelmaking but also maintains the optionality to continue producing blast furnace-grade\npellets. USS Corporation’s Minntac and Keetac plants are Large Power industrial customers of Minnesota Power. USS Corporation has the capability to\nannually produce approximately 15 million tons of blast furnace-grade pellets at its Minntac plant and 5 million tons of blast-furnace grade pellets, or 4\nmillion tons of DR-grade pellets, at its Keetac plant.\nOn December 18, 2023, USS Corporation announced it entered into a definitive agreement in which Nippon Steel will acquire all of the shares of USS\nCorporation. USS Corporation expected the transaction to close by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals, at which time USS Corporation stated\nit will continue to operate under the U.S. Steel brand name and will maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On January 3, 2025, President\nBiden issued an order blocking the transaction, a decision currently being challenged in court.\nOn January 27, 2025, USS Corporation exercised its rights under its electric service agreement with Minnesota Power to provide a four-year notice of\ntermination. Minnesota Power and USS Corporation are working together to meet USS Corporation’s evolving energy needs. Absent any other action by\nthe parties, the termination of the current electric service agreement would be effective January 27, 2029, and USS Corporation would become a non-\ncontract large power customer of Minnesota Power.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n52\nOutlook (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers (Continued)\nCleveland-Cliffs, Inc. (Cliffs). Cliffs is the largest flat-rolled steel producer and the largest iron ore pellet producer in North America, and is also Minnesota\nPower’s largest customer. Its acquisition in 2020 of substantially all of the operations of ArcelorMittal USA LLC and its subsidiaries included\nArcelorMittal’s Minorca mine in Virginia, Minnesota, and its ownership share of Hibbing Taconite in Hibbing, Minnesota, which are both large industrial\ncustomers of Minnesota Power. The acquisition increased customer concentration risk for the Company and could lead to further capacity consolidation for\nboth steel blast furnaces and related Minnesota iron ore production. In 2024, Cliffs announced and completed an acquisition of Stelco Holdings, enhancing\nCliffs’ position as the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America, diversifying Cliffs’ end-markets, and expanding its geographical presence in\nCanada.\nNorthshore Mining. Cliffs idled all production at its Northshore mine in 2022, and subsequently resumed partial pellet plant production in April 2023.\nCliffs indicated it will continue to utilize Northshore Mining as a swing facility. Northshore Mining has the capability to produce approximately 6 million\ntons annually. Minnesota Power has a PSA through 2031 with Silver Bay Power, which provides the majority of the electric service requirements for\nNorthshore Mining.\nHibbing Taconite. Hibbing Taconite is a joint venture between subsidiaries of Cliffs (85.3 percent ownership) and USS Corporation (14.7 percent\nownership). The joint venture is managed by Cliffs and is also a Large Power Customer of Minnesota Power. On May 25, 2023, the Minnesota Executive\nCouncil approved state mineral leases near Nashwauk, Minnesota, with Cliffs, the majority owner of Hibbing Taconite. Cliffs had stated that these leases\nwould provide Hibbing Taconite with more than two decades of additional mineral reserves. In October of 2023, Mesabi Metallics issued a notice of\ntermination of a private iron ore mineral lease agreement previously held by Cliffs, a decision that was affirmed in arbitration in 2024. Cliffs has stated that\nwithout these leases, the future of Hibbing Taconite is once again in question. Prior to the state mineral leases being awarded, Hibbing Taconite had proven\nmineral reserves to support its operations through 2026. Hibbing Taconite has the capability of producing 8 million tons of taconite annually.\nMinnesota Sulfate Wild Rice Water Quality Standard. In April, 2021, the EPA identified rivers and lakes in Minnesota in which wild rice grows that have\nsulfate levels that exceed Minnesota’s sulfate limit for wild rice waters. In September, 2021, three additional wild rice waters with sulfate levels that exceed\nMinnesota’s sulfate limit were identified. The EPA directed the MPCA to add these rivers and lakes to its list of impaired waters which can be used to set\nlimits in discharge permits for industrial activities such as mining. Minnesota Power’s taconite customers could be adversely impacted if they are required\nto significantly reduce sulfate discharges.\nPaper, Pulp and Secondary Wood Products. The North American paper and pulp industry continues to face declining demand due to the impact of\nelectronic substitution for print and changing customer needs. As a result, certain paper and pulp customers have reduced their existing operations in recent\nyears and have pursued or are pursuing product changes in response to the declining demand. The resulting reduction in production capacity outside of\nMinnesota for certain paper grades has solidified our paper customers’ operations, at least for the near term, and as such we expect operating levels in 2025\nat the major paper and pulp mills we serve to be at similar levels as in 2024.\nSofidel. ST Paper, a former Large Power Customer of Minnesota Power, sold its paper mill in Duluth, Minnesota to Sofidel, a privately held Italian\nmultinational company, in the first quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, Sofidel announced plans to invest between $200 million and $250 million\nto add a conversion facility and automated warehouse to the tissue plant.\nPipeline and Other Industries.\nCenovus Energy. In 2023, Cenovus Energy announced that it had commenced a restart of the facility and resumed full operations in 2024 following a\nrebuild from a fire in 2018.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n53\nOutlook (Continued)\nEnergyForward.

The plan includes completed and planned investments in wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric power, construction of\nadditional transmission capacity, the installation of emissions control technology and the idling and retirement of certain coal-fired generating facilities.\nMinnesota Power has a vision to deliver 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers, continuing its commitment to climate, customers and communities\nthrough its EnergyForward strategy. This vision builds on Minnesota Power’s achievement in 2020 of providing 50 percent renewable energy to its\ncustomers. In 2023, the Minnesota Governor signed into law legislation that updates the state’s renewable energy standard and requires Minnesota electric\nutilities to source retail sales with 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2040. Minnesota Power is working with various stakeholders and participating in the\nregulatory process to implement this legislation. (See Item 1. Business – Regulated Operations – Minnesota Legislation.)\n2021 IRP. In February 2021, Minnesota Power filed its latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in a January 2023. The approved IRP, which reflects a\njoint agreement reached with various stakeholders, outlines Minnesota Power’s clean-energy transition plans through 2035. These plans include expanding\nits renewable energy supply, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a resilient and flexible transmission and distribution\ngrid. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding up to 700 MW of new wind and solar energy resources, and ceasing coal operations at\nBoswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Minnesota Power’s plans recognize that advances in technology will play a significant role in\ncompleting its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. Minnesota Power is expected to file its next IRP in March 2025.\nIn recent years, Minnesota Power has transformed its energy supply from more than a 95 percent reliance on coal to become a leader in the nation’s clean-\nenergy transformation. Since 2013, the company has closed or converted seven of its nine coal-fired units and added nearly 900 megawatts of renewable\nenergy sources. Additionally, Minnesota Power has been a leader in energy conservation, surpassing the state’s conservation goals each year for the past\ndecade.\nNemadji Trail Energy Center.

ALLETE also has tax credits and other tax\nadjustments that reduce the combined statutory rate to the effective tax rate. These tax credits and adjustments historically have included items such as\nproduction tax credits, excess deferred taxes, non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, as well as other items. The annual effective rate can also be impacted\nby such items as changes in income before income taxes, state and federal tax law changes that become effective during the year, business combinations,\ntax planning initiatives and resolution of prior years’ tax matters. We expect that our effective tax rate will be lower than the combined statutory rate over\nthe next 5 to 10 years due to tax credits attributable to our wind and solar energy generation.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n58\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Position. ALLETE is well-positioned to meet its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $32.8 million,\n$325.8 million in available consolidated lines of credit, 2.1 million original issue shares of common stock available for issuance through a distribution\nagreement with Lampert Capital Markets, the option (per the Merger Agreement) to request that Alloy Parent purchase up to a total of $300 million of\npreferred stock of ALLETE in the second half of 2025 (see Securities), and a debt-to-capital ratio of 35 percent.\nCapital Structure. ALLETE’s capital structure for each of the last three years is as follows:\nAs of December 31 2024 % 2023 % 2022 %\nMillions     \nALLETE Equity $2,848.0 55 $2,809.6 54 $2,691.9 51 \nNon-Controlling Interest in Subsidiaries 542.1 10 597.0 11 656.4 12 \nShort-Term and Long-Term Debt (a) 1,808.0 35 1,799.4 35 1,929.1 37 \nRedeemable Non-Controlling Interest 0.4 — 0.5 — — — \n$5,198.5 100 $5,206.5 100 $5,277.4 100 \n(a) Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs.\nCash Flows. Selected information from ALLETE’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31 2024 2023 2022\nMillions   \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at Beginning of Period $79.4 $40.2 $47.7 \nCash Flows from (used in)   \nOperating Activities 457.1 585.3 221.3 \nInvesting Activities (340.7) (283.6) (384.0)\nFinancing Activities (140.6) (262.5) 155.2 \nChange in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (24.2) 39.2 (7.5)\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at End of Period $55.2 $79.4 $40.2 \nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was lower in 2024 compared to 2023 reflecting cash proceeds from the sales of ALLETE Clean\nEnergy’s Northern Wind and Red Barn projects in 2023, cash received from the favorable arbitration award by a subsidiary of ALLETE Clean Energy in\n2023, higher cash contributions to defined benefit pension in 2024, and timing of recovery under Minnesota Power’s fuel adjustment clause. These\ndecreases were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of renewable tax credits in 2024.\nCash provided by operating activities was higher in 2023 compared to 2022 reflecting cash proceeds from the sales of ALLETE Clean Energy’s Northern\nWind and Red Barn projects in 2023, cash received from the favorable arbitration award by a subsidiary of ALLETE Clean Energy in 2023, lower\npayments for inventories in 2023 related to the Northern Wind and Red Barn projects, and timing of recovery under Minnesota Power’s fuel adjustment\nclause. Cash provided by operating activities in 2023 also increased due to the timing of recovery under Minnesota Power’s fuel adjustment clause.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities was higher in 2024 compared to 2023 reflecting more payments for additions to property, plant and\nequipment compared to 2023, partially offset by state cash grants received for our HVDC Transmission System Project in 2024. (See Outlook.)\nCash used in investing activities was lower in 2023 compared to 2022 reflecting cash payments for the acquisition of New Energy in 2022. This decrease\nwas partially offset by more payments for additions to property, plant and equipment in 2023 compared to 2022.\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was lower in 2024 compared to 2023 reflecting higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt\ncompared in 2024, partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt in 2024.\nCash used in financing activities in 2023 reflected lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the issuance of long-term debt, and lower\nproceeds from the issuance of non-controlling interest in subsidiaries compared to 2022.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n59\nLiquidity and Capital Resources(Continued)\nWorking Capital. Additional working capital, if and when needed, generally is provided by consolidated bank lines of credit and the issuance of securities,\nincluding long-term debt, common stock and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2024, we had consolidated bank lines of credit aggregating\n$362.0 million ($423.1 million as of December 31, 2023), most of which expire in January 2027. We had $16.2 million outstanding in standby letters of\ncredit and $20.0 million outstanding draws under our lines of credit as of December 31, 2024 ($19.4 million in standby letters of credit and $34.1 million\noutstanding draws as of December 31, 2023). We also have other credit facility agreements in place that provide the ability to issue up to $180.0 million in\nstandby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, we had $118.4 million outstanding in standby letters of credit under these agreements.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had 2.4 million original issue shares of our common stock available for issuance through Invest Direct and\n2.1 million original issue shares of common stock available for issuance through a distribution agreement with Lampert Capital Markets. (See Securities.)\nThe amount and timing of future sales of our securities will depend upon market conditions and our specific needs.\nSecurities. The Merger Agreement also provides that ALLETE may notify Alloy Parent of our intent to raise equity capital of up to a total of $300 million\nin the second half of 2025, subject to certain parameters. If Alloy Parent declines to participate in the equity capital raises or fails to provide timely notice\nwith respect thereto, ALLETE will have the right to issue ALLETE common stock in the public markets for an amount equal to any unfunded amounts\nunder such equity capital raises up to certain limits. (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger.)\nWe entered into a distribution agreement with Lampert Capital Markets, in 2008, as amended most recently in 2020, with respect to the issuance and sale of\nup to an aggregate of 13.6 million shares of our common stock, without par value, of which 2.1 million shares remain available for issuance as of\nDecember 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, no shares of common stock were issued under this agreement (none in 2023; none in 2022).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued 0.3 million shares of common stock through Invest Direct, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and\nthe Retirement Savings and Stock Ownership Plan, resulting in net proceeds of $12.9 million (0.3 million shares for net proceeds of $14.9 million in 2023;\n0.3 million shares for net proceeds of $16.2 million in 2022). See Note 10. Common Stock and Earnings Per Share for additional detail regarding\nALLETE’s equity securities.\nFinancial Covenants. See Note 8. Short-Term and Long-Term Debt for information regarding our financial covenants.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Management considers various factors when making funding decisions, such as regulatory\nrequirements, actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements and contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions for the defined benefit\npension plans. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we made $25.0 million in cash contributions to the defined benefit pension plans. On January 15,\n2025, we contributed $19.1 million in cash to the defined benefit pension plans, and do not expect to make additional cash contributions to the defined\nbenefit pension plans in 2025. We do not expect to make any contributions to the defined benefit postretirement health and life plans in 2025. (See Note 10.\nCommon Stock and Earnings Per Share and Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. ALLETE has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the\nfuture, in addition to its capital expenditure programs. Material contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows:\nLong-Term Debt. ALLETE has material long-term debt obligations, including long-term debt due within one year. These obligations include the principal\namount of bonds, notes and loans which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, plus interest. (See Note 8. Short-Term and Long ‑ Term Debt.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n60\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments (Continued)\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include the current estimate of future benefit\npayments. Pension contributions are dependent on several factors including realized asset performance, future discount rate and other actuarial\nassumptions, Internal Revenue Service and other regulatory requirements, and contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions for the pension plans.\nFunding for the other postretirement benefit plans is impacted by realized asset performance, future discount rate and other actuarial assumptions, and\nutility regulatory requirements. Our obligations are estimates and will change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any\nchanges in governmental regulations. (See Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)\nOperating and Finance Lease Obligations. ALLETE has certain operating and finance lease obligations for the minimum payments required under various\nlease agreements which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.)\nEasement Obligations. ALLETE has easement obligations for the minimum payments required under our land easement agreements at our wind energy\nfacilities. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nPPA Obligations. PPA obligations represent our Square Butte, Manitoba Hydro and other PPAs. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and\nContingencies.)\nOther Purchase Obligations. ALLETE has other purchase obligations covering our minimum purchase commitments under coal supply and rail contracts,\nand long-term service agreements for wind energy facilities. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nCredit Ratings. Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit and ratings. Our securities have been rated by S&P and by\nMoody’s. Rating agencies use both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company’s credit rating. These measures include business risk,\nliquidity risk, competitive position, capital mix, financial condition, predictability of cash flows, management strength and future direction. Some of the\nquantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios, while the qualitative ones are more subjective. Our current credit ratings are listed\nin the following table:\nCredit Ratings S&P (a) Moody’s\nIssuer Credit Rating BBB Baa1\nCommercial Paper A-2 P-2\nFirst Mortgage Bonds (b) A2\n(a) On May 7, 2024, S&P Global Ratings revised its outlook on ALLETE to negative from stable and affirme d all of its ratings on ALLETE. S&P Global Ratings cited the\npossibility for higher leverage and weaker financial measur es because of the Mer ger as its rationale for issuing the negative outlook.\n(b)    Not rated by S&P .\nThe disclosure of these credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time\nby the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nCommon Stock Dividends. ALLETE is committed to providing a competitive dividend to its shareholders while at the same time funding its growth.\nALLETE’s long-term objective is to maintain a dividend payout ratio similar to our peers and provide for future dividend increases. Our targeted payout\nrange is between 60 percent and 70 percent. In 2024, we paid out 91 percent (63 percent in 2023; 77 percent in 2022) of our per share earnings in\ndividends. On January 30, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.73 per share, which is payable on March 1, 2025, to shareholders of\nrecord at the close of business on February 14, 2025.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed not to declare or pay dividends except for quarterly cash dividends payable by us in respect of\nshares of our common stock on a schedule consistent with our past practices in an amount not to exceed 5 percent per share more than the dividend payable\nduring the prior 12-month period, subject to certain other exceptions. (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger).\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n61\nCapital Requirements\nALLETE’s projected capital expenditures for the years 2025 through 2029 are presented in the following table. Actual capital expenditures may vary from\nthe projections due to changes in forecasted plant maintenance, regulatory decisions or approvals, future environmental requirements, base load growth,\ncapital market conditions or executions of new business strategies.

(See Outlook – T ransmission.)\n(b) These capital expenditur es are part of Minnesota Power ’s clean-ener gy transition plans, which include its progress towar d 100 percent carbon-fr ee energy supply , as\ndetailed in Minnesota Power’s latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in January 2023. These capital expenditur es are dependent on successful requests for\nproposal by Minnesota Power . (See Outlook – Ener gyForwar d.)\n(c) Capital expenditur es do not include costs related to developing projects that will be sold upon completion as these costs are accounted for as inventory and reflected in\nInventories – Net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(d) Our portion of estimated capital expenditur es for construction of NTEC, an approximately 600 MW proposed combined-cycle natural gas-fir ed generating facility to be\nbuilt in Superior , Wisconsin, which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin and South Shor e Ener gy.\n(e) These amounts do not include capital expenditur es for pr ojects consider ed to be in their pr eliminary stages.\nWe are well positioned to meet our financing needs due to adequate operating cash flows, available additional working capital and access to capital\nmarkets. We will finance capital expenditures from a combination of internally generated funds, debt and equity issuance proceeds. We intend to maintain a\ncapital structure with capital ratios near current levels. (See Capital Structure.)\nEnvironmental and Other Matters\nOur businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the\nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities over the\npast several years. Minnesota Power’s facilities are subject to additional requirements under many of these regulations. Minnesota Power is reshaping its\ngeneration portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and\npolicy during rulemaking implementation. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nMarket Risk\nSecurities Investments.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities. As of December 31, 2024, our available-for-sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of securities held in other\npostretirement plans to fund employee benefits.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n62\nMarket Risk (Continued)\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to risks resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable rate debt. We manage our interest rate risk by varying\nthe issuance and maturity dates of our fixed rate debt, limiting the amount of variable rate debt, and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in\ninterest rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. The following table\npresents the long-term debt obligations and the corresponding weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2024:\n Expected Maturity Date\nInterest Rate Sensitive \nFinancial Instruments 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter TotalFair Value\nLong-Term Debt  \nFixed Rate – Millions $66.9 $80.2 $162.5 $55.8 $220.3 $1,174.5 $1,760.2 $1,620.2 \nAverage Interest Rate – % 5.4 3.5 4.5 3.8 4.9 4.5 4.5  \nVariable Rate – Millions $27.8 — $20.0 — — — $47.8 $47.8 \nAverage Interest Rate – % 3.7 — 5.7 — — — 4.5  \nInterest rates on variable rate long-term debt are reset on a periodic basis reflecting prevailing market conditions. Based on the variable rate debt\noutstanding as of December 31, 2024, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would impact the amount of pre-tax interest expense by $0.5 million.\nThis amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase to the average variable interest rate on the variable rate\ndebt outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nOur regulated utility operations incur costs for power and fuel (primarily coal and related transportation) in Minnesota, and power and natural gas\npurchased for resale in our regulated service territory in Wisconsin. Minnesota Power’s exposure to price risk for these commodities is significantly\nmitigated by the current ratemaking process and regulatory framework, which allows recovery of fuel costs in excess of those included in base rates or\ndistribution of savings in fuel costs to ratepayers. SWL&P’s exposure to price risk for natural gas is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking\nprocess and regulatory framework, which allows the commodity cost to be passed through to customers. We seek to prudently manage our customers’\nexposure to price risk by entering into contracts of various durations and terms for the purchase of power and coal and related transportation costs\n(Minnesota Power) and natural gas (SWL&P).\nPOWER MARKETING\nMinnesota Power’s power marketing activities consist of: (1) purchasing energy in the wholesale market to serve its regulated service territory when energy\nrequirements exceed generation output; and (2) selling excess available energy and purchased power. From time to time, Minnesota Power may have\nexcess energy that is temporarily not required by retail and municipal customers in our regulated service territory. Minnesota Power actively sells any\nexcess energy to the wholesale market to optimize the value of its generating facilities.\nWe are exposed to credit risk primarily through our power marketing activities. We use credit policies to manage credit risk, which includes utilizing an\nestablished credit approval process and monitoring counterparty limits.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.\nNew accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nSee Item 7.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based\non criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective\ninternal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n74\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters\nAs described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s regulated utility operations are subject to accounting standards for the\neffects of certain types of regulation. As of December 31, 2024, there was $373.3 million of regulatory assets and $602.0 million of regulatory liabilities\nrecorded. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable for recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities\nrepresent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. Management\nassesses quarterly whether regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. As disclosed by management,\nthese standards require the Company to reflect the effect of regulatory decisions in its financial statements. This assessment considers factors such as, but\nnot limited to, changes in the regulatory environment and recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction. If future recovery or\nrefund of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized in current period net income or other comprehensive income.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company’s accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a\ncritical audit matter is the significant judgment by management in determining the recoverability of costs; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the recoverability of costs.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s implementation of new regulatory orders,\nchanges to existing regulatory orders, and assessing the recoverability of costs. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating (i) the\nreasonableness of management’s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations, (ii)\nmanagement’s judgments related to the recoverability of regulatory assets and the establishment of regulatory liabilities, and (iii) the sufficiency of the\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Testing the regulatory assets and liabilities involved considering the provisions and formulas outlined\nin rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, and application of relevant regulatory precedents.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nFebruary 13, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1963.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n75\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nFinancial Statement Preparation. References in this report to “we,” “us,” and “our” are to ALLETE and its subsidiaries, collectively. We prepare our\nfinancial statements in conformity with GAAP. These principles require management to make informed judgments, best estimates, and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The presentation of certain prior\nperiod amounts on the Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted for comparative purposes.\nSubsequent Events. The Company performed an evaluation of subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the time of the financial\nstatements issuance.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of ALLETE, all of our majority owned subsidiary companies\nand variable interest entities of which ALLETE is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nVariable Interest Entities. The accounting guidance for “Variable Interest Entities” (VIE) is a consolidation model that considers if a company has a\nvariable interest in a VIE. A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following conditions: the entity’s equity at risk is not sufficient to permit the\nlegal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, equity owners are unable to direct the activities that most significantly\nimpact the legal entity’s economic performance (or they possess disproportionate voting rights in relation to the economic interest in the legal entity), or the\nequity owners lack the obligation to absorb the legal entity’s expected losses or the right to receive the legal entity’s expected residual returns. Entities are\nrequired to consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore are the primary beneficiary of that\nVIE, as defined by the accounting guidance for “Variable Interest Entities.” In determining whether ALLETE is the primary beneficiary of a VIE,\nmanagement considers whether ALLETE has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and is obligated to absorb losses or receive the\nexpected residual returns that are significant to the VIE. The accounting guidance for VIEs applies to certain ALLETE Clean Energy wind energy facilities,\ncertain New Energy Equity facilities, and our investment in Nobles 2. (See Tax Equity Financing.)\nBusiness Segments. We present two reportable segments: Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. Our segments were determined in accordance\nwith the guidance on segment reporting. We measure performance of our operations through budgeting and monitoring of contributions to consolidated net\nincome by each business segment.\nRegulated Operations includes our regulated utilities, Minnesota Power and SWL&P, as well as our investment in ATC, a Wisconsin-based regulated\nutility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. Minnesota Power provides\nregulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately 150,000 retail customers. Minnesota Power also has 14 non-affiliated\nmunicipal customers in Minnesota. SWL&P is a Wisconsin utility and a wholesale customer of Minnesota Power. SWL&P provides regulated utility\nelectric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately 15,000 electric customers, 13,000 natural gas customers and\n10,000 water customers. Our regulated utility operations include retail and wholesale activities under the jurisdiction of state and federal regulatory\nauthorities.\nALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns,\noperates, or has developed 1,600 MW of wind energy generation in five major energy markets and eight states across the U.S. with a majority contracted\nunder PSAs of various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate under long-term\nPSAs or for sale to others upon completion.\nCorporate and Other is comprised of New Energy, our investment in Nobles 2, South Shore Energy, BNI Energy, ALLETE Properties, other business\ndevelopment and corporate expenditures, unallocated interest expense, a small amount of non-rate base generation, land holdings in Minnesota, and\nearnings on cash and investments.\nNew Energy is a renewable energy development company with a primary focus on solar and storage facilities while also offering comprehensive\noperations, maintenance and asset management services.\nOur investment in Nobles 2 represents a 49 percent equity interest in Nobles 2, the entity that owns and operates a 250 MW wind energy facility in\nsouthwestern Minnesota pursuant to a 20-year PPA with Minnesota Power.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n81\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nSouth Shore Energy, ALLETE’s non-rate regulated, Wisconsin subsidiary, is developing NTEC, an approximately 600 MW proposed combined-cycle\nnatural gas-fired generating facility to be built in Superior, Wisconsin, which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin and South\nShore Energy. (See Note 3. Jointly-Owned Facilities and Assets.)\nBNI Energy mines and sells lignite coal to two North Dakota mine-mouth generating units, one of which is Square Butte. In 2024, Square Butte supplied\n50 percent (227.5 MW) of its output to Minnesota Power under long-term contracts. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nALLETE Properties represents our legacy Florida real estate investment. Our strategy incorporates the possibility of a bulk sale of the entire ALLETE\nProperties portfolio. Proceeds from a bulk sale would be strategically deployed to support growth at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy.\nALLETE Properties continues to pursue sales of individual parcels over time and will continue to maintain key entitlements and infrastructure.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash. We consider all investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents. As of December 31, 2024, restricted cash amounts included in Prepayments and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are primarily related\nto funds held in escrow for the purchase of land. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, restricted cash amounts included in Prepayments and Other also\ninclude deposits required under a tax equity financing agreement and collateral deposits required under an ALLETE Clean Energy loan agreement. The\nrestricted cash amounts included in Other Non-Current Assets represent collateral deposits required under an ALLETE Clean Energy loan agreement and\nPSAs. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheet that\naggregate to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAs of December 31 2024 2023 2022\nMillions\nCash and Cash Equivalents $32.8 $71.9 $36.4 \nRestricted Cash included in Prepayments and Other 19.9 5.1 1.5 \nRestricted Cash included in Other Non-Current Assets 2.5 2.4 2.3 \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash on the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows $55.2 $79.4 $40.2 \nSupplemental Statement of Cash Flow Information.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nYear Ended December 31 2024 2023 2022\nMillions   \nCash Paid During the Period for Interest – Net of Amounts Capitalized $75.1 $80.5 $72.8 \nCash Paid for Income Taxes $19.1 $19.5 $6.0 \nNoncash Investing and Financing Activities\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable for Capital Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment $15.5 $2.2 $(9.6)\nReclassification of Property, Plant and Equipment to Inventory (a) — — $99.7 \nCapitalized Asset Retirement Costs (b) $55.0 $5.8 $11.8 \nAFUDC–Equity $5.0 $3.6 $2.7 \n(a) The decommissioning of the existing Northern Wind assets resulted in a reclassification from Property , Plant and Equipment – Net to Inventories – Net in the second\nquarter of 2022 as they were repower ed and subsequ ently sold to a subsidiary of Xcel Ener gy Inc.

Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n82\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nAccounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is\nbased on our evaluation of the receivable portfolio under current conditions, overall portfolio quality, review of specific situations and such other factors\nthat, in our judgment, deserve recognition in estimating losses.\nAccounts Receivable\nAs of December 31 2024 2023\nMillions\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nBilled $115.9 $106.8 \nUnbilled 27.2 23.8 \nLess: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 1.7 1.6 \nTotal Trade Accounts Receivable 141.4 129.0 \nIncome Taxes Receivable 6.7 8.2 \nTotal Accounts Receivable $148.1 $137.2 \nConcentration of Credit Risk. We are subject to concentration of credit risk primarily as a result of accounts receivable. Minnesota Power sells electricity\nto eight Large Power Customers. Receivables from these customers totaled $13.3 million as of December 31, 2024 ($11.2 million as of December 31,\n2023). Minnesota Power does not obtain collateral to support utility receivables, but monitors the credit standing of major customers. In addition,\nMinnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large Power Customers to pay weekly for electric usage based on monthly\nenergy usage estimates, which allows us to closely manage collection of amounts due. Minnesota Power’s taconite customers, which are currently owned\nby two entities at the end of 2024, accounted for 33 percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue and 27 percent of consolidated operating revenue in\n2024 (32 percent of Regulated Operations operating revenue and 21 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2023 and 32 percent of Regulated\nOperations operating revenue and 26 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2022).\nLong-Term Finance Receivables. Long-term finance receivables relating to our real estate operations are collateralized by property sold, accrue interest at\nmarket-based rates and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We assess delinquent finance receivables by comparing the balance of such\nreceivables to the estimated fair value of the collateralized property. If the fair value of the property is less than the finance receivable, we record a reserve\nfor the difference. We estimate fair value based on recent property tax assessed values or current appraisals.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities. Available-for-sale debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale\ndebt securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale equity\nsecurities are recognized in earnings. We use the specific identification method as the basis for determining the cost of securities sold.\nInventories – Net. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories in our Regulated Operations segment are carried at an\naverage cost or first-in, first-out basis. Inventories in our ALLETE Clean Energy segment and Corporate and Other businesses are carried at an average\ncost, first-in, first-out or specific identification basis.\nInventories – Net\nAs of December 31 2024 2023\nMillions   \nFuel (a) $22.5 $27.2 \nMaterials and Supplies 107.6 115.7 \nRenewable Energy Facilities Under Development (b) 24.5 32.5 \nTotal Inventories – Net $154.6 $175.4 \n(a)    Fuel consists primarily of coal inventory at Minnesota Power .\n(b) Renewable Ener gy Facilities Under Development consists primarily of pr oject costs r elated to r enewable ener gy development pr ojects at New Ener gy.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n83\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nPrepayments and Other Current Assets. Prepayments and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included $32.4 million of costs in excess of billings\nat New Energy as of December 31, 2024 ($21.5 million as of December 31, 2023).\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at original cost and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of\naccumulated depreciation. Expenditures for additions, significant replacements, improvements and major plant overhauls are capitalized; maintenance and\nrepair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains or losses on property, plant and equipment for Corporate and Other operations, except New Energy, are\nrecognized when they are retired or otherwise disposed. When property, plant and equipment in our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy\nsegments as well as at New Energy are retired or otherwise disposed, no gain or loss is recognized in accordance with the accounting standards for\ncomposite depreciation except for certain circumstances where the retirement is unforeseen or unexpected. Our Regulated Operations capitalize AFUDC,\nwhich includes both an interest and equity component. AFUDC represents the cost of both debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions\nduring construction periods. AFUDC amounts capitalized are included in rate base and are recovered from customers as the related property is depreciated.\nUpon MPUC approval of cost recovery, the recognition of AFUDC ceases. (See Note 2. Property, Plant and Equipment.)\nWe believe that long-standing ratemaking practices approved by applicable state and federal regulatory commissions allow for the recovery of the\nremaining book value of retired plant assets. The MPUC order for Minnesota Power’s 2015 IRP directed Minnesota Power to retire Boswell Units 1 and 2,\nwhich occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. As part of the 2016 general retail rate case, the MPUC allowed recovery of the remaining book value of\nBoswell Units 1 and 2 through 2022. Minnesota Power’s latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9, 2023, includes ceasing\ncoal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Boswell Unit 3 and Unit 4 have a net book value of approximately $220 million\nand $395 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) Minnesota Power also retired Taconite Harbor in the first\nquarter of 2023 consistent with its latest IRP. As part of the 2022 general retail rate case, the MPUC allowed recovery of the remaining book value of\nTaconite Harbor through 2026. We do not expect to record any impairment charge as a result of these operating changes at Taconite Harbor and Boswell. In\naddition, we expect to be able to continue depreciating these assets for at least their established remaining useful lives; however, we are unable to predict\nthe impact of regulatory outcomes resulting in changes to their established remaining useful lives.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We review our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for\nproperty, plant and equipment on a quarterly basis. This includes our property, plant and equipment (see Property, Plant and Equipment) and land\ninventory. Land inventory is accounted for as held for use and is recorded at cost, unless the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable in\naccordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment, in which case the land inventory is written down to estimated fair value.\nIn accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment, if indicators of impairment exist, we test our long-lived assets for\nrecoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Cash flows\nare assessed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The undiscounted future net cash flows are impacted by trends and factors known to us at the\ntime they are calculated, and our expectations related to: management’s best estimate of future use; sales prices; holding period and timing of sales; method\nof disposition; and future expenditures necessary to maintain the operations.\nWe continue to monitor changes in the broader energy markets along with wind resource expectations that could indicate impairment at ALLETE Clean\nEnergy wind energy facilities upon contract expirations. A decline in energy prices or lower wind resource expectations could result in a future impairment.\nIn 2023 and 2022 there were triggering events identified for our property, plant, and equipment at certain ALLETE Clean Energy wind energy facilities. A\nrecoverability test was performed indicating that the undiscounted cash flows adequately supported the property, plant and equipment book values. As a\nresult, no impairment was recorded in 2023 or 2022. In 2024, there were no triggering events identified for our property, plant, and equipment at ALLETE\nClean Energy.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n84\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nGovernment Grants. We recognize government grants when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to\nthe grant and that the grant will be received. Grants whose primary condition is the purchase, construction, or acquisition of a long-lived asset are\nconsidered asset-based grants and are recognized as a reduction to such asset’s cost basis, which reduces future depreciation. Cash inflows from asset-based\ngrants are considered cash flows provided by investing activities. Other grants not related to long-lived assets are considered income-based grants, which\nare recognized as a reduction to the related cost of activities that generated the benefit are presented. Cash inflows from grants related to income are\nconsidered cash flows provided by operating activities.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Minnesota Power received $14.9 million in state funding related to its HVDC Transmission System Project as part of an energy\nand climate budget bill passed by the Minnesota Legislature in 2023. This was considered an asset-based grant and resulted in the reduction to cost basis\nfor the related assets, and it is subject to regulatory obligations with the MPUC.\nThere were no benefits recognized from income-based government grants in our consolidated statement of income in 2022, 2023 or 2024.\nDerivatives. ALLETE is exposed to certain risks relating to its business operations that can be managed through the use of derivative instruments.\nALLETE may enter into derivative instruments to manage those risks including interest rate risk related to certain variable-rate borrowings, and commodity\nprice and transmission congestion cost risk related to sales to electric customers. We have determined that either these agreements are immaterial to the\nfinancial statements, are not derivatives, or, if they are derivatives, these agreements qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception to\nderivative accounting guidance; therefore, derivative accounting is not required.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We apply the fair value recognition guidance for share-based payments. Under this guidance, we recognize\nstock-based compensation expense for all share-based payments granted, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. (See Note 13. Employee Stock and Incentive\nPlans.)\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. In\naccordance with GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is assessed annually in the fourth quarter for impairment and whenever an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level.\nAs of the date of our annual goodwill impairment testing in 2024, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment,\nproceeding directly to the two-step impairment test for the New Energy reporting unit. In performing Step 1 of the impairment test, we compared the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting\nunit, Step 2 of the impairment test would be performed. Step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value,\nif lower, as of the test date.\nFor Step 1 of the impairment test, we estimated the reporting unit's fair value using standard valuation techniques, including techniques which use estimates\nof projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. Such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes a growth\nrate on debt-free cash flows. These cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by\nmanagement regarding future performance. Our annual impairment test in 2024 indicated that the estimated fair value of New Energy exceeded its carrying\nvalue, and therefore no impairment existed. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model, using significant\nassumptions which included a discount rate of 12.5 percent, cash flow forecasts through 2033, gross margins, and a terminal growth rate of 3.5 percent.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n85\nOther Non-Current Assets\nAs of December 31 2024 2023\nMillions\nContract Assets (a) $15.9 $18.5 \nALLETE Properties 10.3 10.8 \nRestricted Cash 2.5 2.4 \nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans 107.6 106.3 \nOther 134.2 124.9 \nTotal Other Non-Current Assets $270.5 $262.9 \n(a)    Contract Assets include payments made to customers as an incentive to execute or extend service agr eements.

We determine if a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception and recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with a term greater\nthan 12 months. Our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases are included in Other Non-Current Assets, Other Current\nLiabilities and Other Non-Current Liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments\narising from the lease. Operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the estimated\npresent value of lease payments over the lease term. As our leases do not provide an explicit rate, we determine the present value of future lease payments\nbased on our estimated incremental borrowing rate using information available at the lease commencement date. The operating and finance lease right-of-\nuse assets includes lease payments to be made during the lease term and any lease incentives, as applicable.\nOur leases may include options to extend or buy out the lease at certain points throughout the term, and if it is reasonably certain at lease commencement\nthat we will exercise that option, we include those rental payments in our calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Lease and rent expense are\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases. Finance leases recognize interest expense using the interest expense method\nover the lease term and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term, unless a buy out option\nis reasonably certain to be exercised, for which we then amortize on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leases with a term of 12 months or\nless are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe majority of our operating leases are for heavy equipment, vehicles and land with fixed monthly payments which we group into two categories: Vehicles\nand Equipment; and Land and Other. Our largest operating lease is for the drag line at BNI Energy which includes a termination payment at the end of the\nlease term if we do not exercise our purchase option. The amount of this payment is $3 million and is included in our calculation of the right-of-use asset\nand lease liability recorded. None of our other leases contain residual value guarantees. We have one finance lease for heavy equipment which includes a\npurchase option we are reasonably certain to exercise when the lease terminates.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n87\nNOTE 1.

Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable\nthat a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. Accruals are\nadjusted as assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental\nliabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties.\nCosts related to environmental contamination treatment and cleanup are expensed unless recoverable in rates from customers. (See Note 9. Commitments,\nGuarantees and Contingencies.)\nRevenue.\nContracts with Customers – Utility includes sales from our regulated operations for generation, transmission and distribution of electric service, and\ndistribution of water and gas services to our customers. Also included is an immaterial amount of regulated steam generation that is used by customers in\nthe production of paper and pulp.\nContracts with Customers – Non-utility includes sales of goods and services to customers from ALLETE Clean Energy and our Corporate and Other\nbusinesses.\nOther – Non-utility is the non-cash adjustments to revenue recognized by ALLETE Clean Energy for the amortization of differences between contract\nprices and estimated market prices for PSAs that were assumed during the acquisition of various wind energy facilities.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected\nfrom customers, which are subsequently remitted to the appropriate governmental authorities. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur\nafter the customer obtains control of goods as a cost rather than an additional performance obligation thereby recognizing revenue at time of shipment and\naccruing shipping and handling costs when control transfers to our customers. We have a right to consideration from our customers in an amount that\ncorresponds directly with the value to the customer for our performance completed to date; therefore, we may recognize revenue in the amount to which we\nhave a right to invoice.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n89\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nRevenue (Continued)\nNature of Revenue Streams\nUtility\nResidential and Commercial includes sales for electric, gas or water service to customers, who have implied contracts with the utility, under rates governed\nby the MPUC, PSCW or FERC. Customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis and revenue is recognized for electric, gas or water service delivered during\nthe billing period. Revenue is accrued for service provided but not yet billed at period end. Performance obligations with these customers are satisfied at\ntime of delivery to customer meters and simultaneously consumed.\nMunicipal includes sales to 14 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota under long-term wholesale electric contracts. One of these wholesale\nelectric contracts include a termination clause requiring a three-year notice to terminate. These contracts have termination dates ranging through 2037, with\na majority of contracts expiring in 2029. Performance obligations with these customers are satisfied at the time energy is delivered to an agreed upon\nmunicipal substation or meter.\nIndustrial includes sales recognized from contracts with customers in the taconite mining, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, pipeline and other\nindustries. Industrial sales accounted for approximately 56 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. Within\nindustrial revenue, Minnesota Power had eight Large Power Customer contracts, each serving requirements of 10 MW or more of customer load as of\nDecember 31, 2024. These contracts automatically renew past the contract term unless a four-year written notice is given. Large Power Customer contracts\nhave earliest termination dates ranging from 2028 through 2029. We satisfy our performance obligations for these customers at the time energy is delivered\nto an agreed upon customer substation. Revenue is accrued for energy provided but not yet billed at period end. Based on current contracts with industrial\ncustomers, we expect to recognize minimum revenue for the fixed contract components of approximately $60 million per annum through 2028 and\napproximately $10 million in 2029, which reflects the termination notice period in these contracts. When determining minimum revenue, we assume that\ncustomer contracts will continue under the contract renewal provision; however, if long-term contracts are renegotiated and subsequently approved by the\nMPUC or there are changes within our industrial customer class, these amounts may be impacted. Contracts with customers that contain variable pricing or\nquantity components are excluded from the expected minimum revenue amounts.\nOther Power Suppliers includes the sale of energy under a long-term PSA with one customer as well as MISO market and liquidation sales. The expiration\ndate of this PSA is 2028. Performance obligations with these customers are satisfied at the time energy is delivered to an agreed upon delivery point\ndefined in the contract (generally the MISO pricing node). The current contract with one customer contains variable pricing components that prevent us\nfrom estimating future minimum revenue.\nOther Revenue includes all remaining individually immaterial revenue streams for Minnesota Power and SWL&P, and is comprised of steam sales to paper\nand pulp mills, wheeling revenue and other sources. Revenue for steam sales to customers is recognized at the time steam is delivered and simultaneously\nconsumed. Revenue is recognized at the time each performance obligation is satisfied.\nECO Financial incentives reflects certain revenue that is a result of the achievement of certain objectives for our ECO financial incentives. This revenue is\naccounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for alternative revenue programs which allow for the recognition of revenue under an alternative\nrevenue program if the program is established by an order from the utility’s regulatory commission, the order allows for automatic adjustment of future\nrates, the amount of revenue recognized is objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and the revenue will be collected within 24 months following\nthe end of the annual period in which it is recognized. ECO financial incentives are recognized in the period in which the MPUC approves the filing, which\nis typically mid-year.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n90\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nRevenue (Continued)\nNon-utility\nALLETE Clean Energy\nLong-term PSA revenue includes all sales recognized under long-term contracts for production, curtailment, capacity and associated renewable energy\ncredits from ALLETE Clean Energy wind energy facilities. Expiration dates of these PSAs range from 2027 through 2039. Performance obligations for\nthese contracts are satisfied at the time energy is delivered to an agreed upon point, or production is curtailed at the request of the customer, at specified\nprices. Revenue from the sale of renewable energy credits is recognized at the same time the related energy is delivered to the customer when sold to the\nsame party.\nSale of Wind Energy Facility includes revenue recognized for the design, development, construction, and sale of a wind energy facility to a customer.\nPerformance obligations for these types of agreements are satisfied at the time the completed project is transferred to the customer at the commercial\noperation date. Revenue from the sale of a wind energy facility is recognized at the time of asset transfer.\nOther is the non-cash adjustments to revenue recognized by ALLETE Clean Energy for the amortization of differences between contract prices and\nestimated market prices on assumed PSAs. As part of wind energy facility acquisitions, ALLETE Clean Energy assumed various PSAs that were above or\nbelow estimated market prices at the time of acquisition; the resulting differences between contract prices and estimated market prices are amortized to\nrevenue over the remaining PSA term.\nCorporate and Other\nLong-term Contract encompasses the sale and delivery of coal to customer generation facilities. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis at the cost of\nproduction plus a specified profit per ton of coal delivered to the customer. Coal sales are secured under long-term coal supply agreements extending\nthrough 2037. Performance obligations are satisfied during the period as coal is delivered to customer generation facilities.\nSale of Renewable Development Projects includes revenue recognized from development only and development plus construction type projects that are\nsold to a customer. For development only projects, revenue is recognized at point in time when all required development responsibilities have been\ncompleted and ownership has transferred to the customer. For development plus construction, the transaction price is allocated to two performance\nobligations based upon the standalone selling price of each obligation. Revenue is recognized on the development performance obligation upon satisfying\nall required development activities and ownership transferring to the customer. Revenue for the construction performance obligation is recognized over\ntime based on construction costs incurred, beginning at notice to proceed through the commercial operation date.\nOther primarily includes revenue from BNI Energy unrelated to coal, revenue from New Energy for asset management services and non-development\nactivities, the sale of real estate from ALLETE Properties, and non ‑ rate base steam generation that is sold for use during production of paper and pulp.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied when control transfers to the customer.\nPayment Terms. Payment terms and conditions vary across our businesses. Aside from taconite-producing Large Power Customers, payment terms\ngenerally require payment to be made within 15 days to 30 days from the end of the period that the service has been rendered. In the case of its taconite-\nproducing Large Power Customers, as permitted by the MPUC, Minnesota Power requires weekly payments for electric usage based on monthly energy\nusage estimates. These customers receive estimated bills based on Minnesota Power’s estimate of the customers’ energy usage, forecasted energy prices\nand fuel adjustment clause estimates. Minnesota Power’s taconite-producing Large Power Customers have generally predictable energy usage on a weekly\nbasis and any differences that occur are trued-up the following month. Due to the timing difference of revenue recognition from the timing of invoicing and\npayment, the taconite-producing Large Power Customers receive credit for the time value of money; however, we have determined that our contracts do not\ninclude a significant financing component as the period between when we transfer the service to the customer and when they pay for such service is\nminimal.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n91\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nRevenue (Continued)\nAssets Recognized From the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer. We recognize as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a\ncustomer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We expense incremental costs when the asset that would have resulted from\ncapitalizing these costs would have been amortized in one year or less. As of December 31, 2024, we have $15.9 million of assets recognized for costs\nincurred to obtain contracts with our customers ($18.5 million as of December 31, 2023). Management determined the amount of costs to be recognized as\nassets based on actual costs incurred and paid to obtain and fulfill these contracts to provide goods and services to our customers. Assets recognized to\nobtain contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term as a non-cash reduction to revenue. We recognized $2.4 million of non-cash\namortization for the year ended December 31, 2024 ($2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023).\nUnamortized Discount and Premium on Debt. Discount and premium on debt are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt instruments\nusing a method which approximates the effective interest method.\nTax Equity Financings. Certain subsidiaries of ALLETE have entered into tax equity financings that include forming limited liability companies (LLC)\nwith third-party investors for certain wind and solar projects. Tax equity financings have specific terms that dictate distributions of cash and the allocation\nof tax attributes among the LLC members, who are divided into two categories: the sponsor and third-party investors. ALLETE subsidiaries are the\nsponsors in these tax equity financings. The distributions of cash and allocation of tax attributes in these financings generally differ from the underlying\nownership percentage interests in the related LLC, with a disproportionate share of tax attributes (including accelerated depreciation and production tax\ncredits) allocated to third-party investors in order to achieve targeted after-tax rates of return, or target yield, from project operations, and a disproportionate\nshare of cash distributions made to the sponsor.\nThe target yield and other terms vary by tax equity financing. Once the target yield has been achieved or defined time period is met, a “flip point” is\nrecognized. In addition, tax equity financings typically provide that cash distributions can be temporarily increased to the third-party investors in order to\nmeet cumulative distribution thresholds. After the flip point, tax attributes and cash distributions are both typically disproportionately allocated to the\nsponsor.\nTax equity financings include affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to what a project lender would require in a project financing, such as\nfinancial reporting, insurance, maintenance and prudent operator standards. Most covenants are no longer applicable once the flip point occurs and any\nother obligations of the third-party investor have been eliminated.\nThe third-party investors’ portions of equity ownership in tax equity LLCs are recorded as non-controlling interest in subsidiaries on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet and earnings allocated to third-party investors are recorded as net loss attributable to non-controlling interest on the Consolidated Statement\nof Income.\nNon-Controlling Interest in Subsidiaries and Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest. Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries and redeemable non-\ncontrolling interest represent the portion of equity ownership, net income (loss), and comprehensive income (loss) in subsidiaries that is not attributable to\nequity holders of ALLETE. Non-controlling Interest in Subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, are related to the tax equity\nfinancings for ALLETE Clean Energy’s 106 MW Glen Ullin, 80 MW South Peak, 303 MW Diamond Spring and 303 MW Caddo wind energy facilities as\nwell as ALLETE’s equity investment in the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind energy facility. Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, is related to a tax equity financing entered into in the fourth quarter of 2023 for certain New Energy solar energy facilities totaling 14\nMW. This tax equity financing is classified as redeemable non-controlling interest as the redemption price and date are fixed and determinable.\nFor those wind and solar projects with tax equity financings where the economic benefits are not allocated based on the underlying ownership percentage\ninterests, we have determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries balance is the hypothetical\nliquidation at book value (HLBV) method. The HLBV method is a balance sheet approach which reflects the substantive economic arrangements in the tax\nequity financing structures.\nUnder the HLBV method, amounts reported as non-controlling interest in subsidiaries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent the amounts the third-\nparty investors would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet reporting date under the liquidation provisions of the LLC agreements, assuming the net\nassets of the wind and solar projects were liquidated at amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and distributed to the third-party investor and\nsponsor. The resulting non-controlling interest in subsidiaries balance in these projects is reported as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet as either Non-Controlling Interest in Subsidiaries or Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n92\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nThe results of operations for these projects attributable to non-controlling interest under the HLBV method is determined as the difference in non-\ncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and redeemable non-controlling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the start and end of each reporting period,\nafter taking into account any capital transactions between the projects and the third-party investors.\nFactors used in the HLBV calculation include GAAP income, taxable income (loss), tax attributes such as accelerated depreciation, investment tax credits\nand production tax credits, capital contributions, cash distributions, and the target yield specified in the corresponding LLC agreement. Changes in these\nfactors could have a significant impact on the amounts that third-party investors and sponsors would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation. The use of the\nHLBV method to allocate income to the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries may create variability in our results of operations as the application of the\nHLBV method can drive variability in net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries from period to period.\nOther Income (Expense) - Other\nYear Ended December 31 2024 2023 2022\nMillions\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Non-Service Credit (a) $13.6 $8.9 $9.8 \nInterest and Investment Income (b) 4.0 10.3 — \nAFUDC - Equity 5.0 3.6 2.7 \nGain on Land Sales 0.1 0.2 — \nPSA Liability (c) — — 10.2 \nGain on Arbitration Award (d) — 58.4 — \nOther Income (Expense) 0.3 3.6 (0.3)\nTotal Other Income (Expense) - Other $23.0 $85.0 $22.4 \n(a) These are components of net periodic pension and other postr etirement benefit cost other than service cost.

(See Note 9. Commitments,\nGuarantees and Contingencies.)\nIncome Taxes. ALLETE and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return as well as combined and separate state income tax returns. We\naccount for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with GAAP for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities are established for all temporary differences in the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to\nthe periods in which the taxes become payable.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n93\nNOTE 1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nDue to the effects of regulation on Minnesota Power and SWL&P, certain adjustments made to deferred income taxes are, in turn, recorded as regulatory\nassets or liabilities. Tax credits are recorded when earned unless there is a requirement to defer the benefit and amortize it over the book depreciable lives\nof the related property. The requirement to defer and amortize tax credits only applies to federal credits related to public utility property. In accordance with\nGAAP for uncertainty in income taxes, we are required to recognize in our financial statements the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is\n“more ‑ likely ‑ than ‑ not” to be sustained on audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position as of the reporting date. The term\n“more ‑ likely ‑ than ‑ not” means more than 50 percent likely. (See Note 11. Income Tax Expense.)\nExcise Taxes. We collect excise taxes from our customers levied by governmental entities. These taxes are stated separately on the billing to the customer\nand recorded as a liability to be remitted to the governmental entity. We account for the collection and payment of these taxes on a net basis.\nNew Accounting Standards.\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 requires that an entity provide enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses\nthat are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, among other disclosures. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and this Form 10-K includes the required disclosures. We expect to provide enhanced disclosures for quarterly periods beginning in\n2025.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 was issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by disclosing specific\ncategories in the rate reconciliation as well as providing additional information for reconciling items above a threshold. It also requires disclosure about\ncertain income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We do not\nanticipate ASU 2023-09 having a material effect on the presentation of ALLETE’s consolidated financial statements.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income\nStatement Expenses (ASU 2024-03). ASU 2024-03 was issued to improve expense disclosures by providing more detailed information about the types of\nexpenses in commonly presented expense captions. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 25, 2026, and quarterly periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2027. We do not anticipate ASU 2024-03 having a material effect on the presentation of ALLETE’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nSEC Climate-related Disclosures Rule. On March 6, 2024, the SEC issued the final rules regarding the enhancement and standardization of climate-related\ndisclosures for investors (Rule). The Rule requires registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their annual reports and registration\nstatements. These requirements include disclosing climate-related risks that materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect a registrant’s\nbusiness strategy, results of operations, or financial condition as well as certain disclosures related to greenhouse-gas emissions, and the effects of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions. The Rule provides that the disclosure requirements will begin phasing in for annual periods beginning in 2025.\nThe Company is evaluating the final rule to determine its impact on the Company’s disclosures. The Rule is currently being challenged before the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Eighth Circuit Court), and the SEC issued a voluntary stay of the Rule on April 4, 2024, pending judicial review.\nThere are no other new accounting standards that we anticipate having a material effect on the presentation of ALLETE’s consolidated financial statements.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n94\nNOTE 2.

We recognize, at fair value, obligations associated with the retirement of certain tangible, long-lived assets that result from\nthe acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of the asset. Asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate primarily to the decommissioning\nof our coal-fired and wind energy facilities, and land reclamation at BNI Energy. AROs are included in Other Non-Current Liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of the asset.\nRemoval costs associated with certain distribution and transmission assets have not been recognized, as these facilities have indeterminate useful lives.\nConditional asset retirement obligations have been identified for treated wood poles and remaining polychlorinated biphenyl and asbestos-containing\nassets; however, the period of remediation is indeterminable and removal liabilities have not been recognized.\nLong-standing ratemaking practices approved by applicable state and federal regulatory authorities have allowed provisions for future plant removal costs\nin depreciation rates. These plant removal cost recoveries are classified either as AROs or as a regulatory liability for non-AROs. To the extent annual\naccruals for plant removal costs differ from accruals under approved depreciation rates, a regulatory asset has been established in accordance with GAAP\nfor AROs. (See Note 4.

Minnesota Power is expected to purchase approximately 20 percent of the facility's output starting upon\ncompletion of the facility pursuant to a capacity dedication agreement. Construction of NTEC is subject to obtaining additional permits from local, state\nand federal authorities. The total project cost is estimated to be approximately $700 million, of which South Shore Energy will be responsible for\napproximately 20 percent. South Shore Energy’s portion of NTEC project costs incurred through December 31, 2024, is approximately $10 million.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n96\nNOTE 4. REGULATORY MATTERS\nElectric Rates. Entities within our Regulated Operations segment file for periodic rate revisions with the MPUC, PSCW or FERC. As authorized by the\nMPUC, Minnesota Power also recognizes revenue under cost recovery riders for transmission, renewable and environmental investments and expenditures.\n(See Transmission Cost Recovery Rider, Renewable Cost Recovery Rider, Solar Cost Recovery Rider and Environmental Improvement Rider.) Revenue\nfrom cost recovery riders was $20.0 million in 2024 ($57.0 million in 2023; $38.8 million in 2022).\nMinnesota Retail Rates. Minnesota Power’s retail base rates through 2022 were based on a 2018 MPUC retail rate order that allowed for a 9.25 percent\nreturn on common equity and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. Interim rates were implemented in Minnesota Power’s 2022 general rate case beginning in\nJanuary 2022, and the resolution of Minnesota Power’s 2022 general rate case changed the allowed return on equity to 9.65 percent and the equity ratio to\n52.50 percent beginning October 1, 2023. (See 2022 Minnesota General Rate Case.) Minnesota Power expects to implement updated rates based on the\n2024 MPUC retail rate order in the first quarter of 2025. This order allows for a return on equity 9.78 percent and an equity ratio of 53.00 percent.\n2024 Minnesota General Rate Case. On November 1, 2023, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average\nincrease of approximately 12.00 percent for retail customers, net of rider revenue incorporated into base rates. The rate filing sought a return on equity of\n10.30 percent and a 53.00 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would have generated approximately $89 million in\nadditional revenue. In separate orders dated December 19, 2023, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and approved an annual interim rate increase of\napproximately $64 million, net of rider revenue, beginning January 1, 2024, subject to refund.\nOn May 3, 2024, Minnesota Power entered into a settlement agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Minnesota Office of the Attorney\nGeneral, Residential Utilities Division, and Large Power Intervenors to settle the retail rate increase request. As part of the settlement agreement, the parties\nagreed on all issues, including an overall rate increase of $33.97 million, net of rider revenue and amounts transferring to the fuel adjustment clause, a\nreturn on equity of 9.78 percent, an equity ratio of 53.00 percent, all non-financial items and cost allocation. In an order dated November 25, 2024, the\nMPUC approved the settlement agreement. Final rates are expected to be implemented in the first quarter of 2025; interim rates will be collected through\nthis period with reserves recorded as necessary. As a result of the settlement, Minnesota Power recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund of\n$23.0 million pre-tax as of December 31, 2024, which is subject to MPUC approval of Minnesota Power’s refund calculation.\n2022 Minnesota General Rate Case. In an order dated February 28, 2023, the MPUC made determinations regarding Minnesota Power’s general rate case\nincluding allowing a return on common equity of 9.65 percent and a 52.50 percent equity ratio. In March 2023, Minnesota Power filed a petition for\nreconsideration with the MPUC requesting reconsideration and clarification of certain decisions in the MPUC’s order. The MPUC denied the requests for\nreconsideration in an order dated May 15, 2023.\nIn an order dated September 29, 2023, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power’s final rates, which were implemented beginning on October 1, 2023. The\nMPUC order also approved Minnesota Power’s interim rate refund plan. Interim rates were collected through the third quarter of 2023 with reserves\nrecorded as necessary. Minnesota Power recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund of approximately $39 million pre-tax as of September 30, 2023\n(approximately $18 million as of December 31, 2022), which was refunded to customers during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nMinnesota Power appealed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals (Court) specific aspects of the MPUC’s February 2023 and May 2023 rate case orders for\nthe ratemaking treatment of Taconite Harbor and Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset. On September 9, 2024, the Court affirmed the MPUC’s\nTaconite Harbor treatment, but reversed and remanded the treatment of Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset back to the MPUC. The Court directed\nthe MPUC to determine the amount of Minnesota Power’s prepaid pension asset to be included in rate base. The MPUC has not yet determined the next\nprocedural steps in implementing the Court’s decision.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n97\nNOTE 4. REGULATORY MATTERS (Continued)\nElectric Rates (Continued)\nFERC-Approved Wholesale Rates. Minnesota Power has wholesale contracts with 14 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota and SWL&P. Two of\nthe wholesale contracts include a termination clause requiring a three-year notice to terminate.\nMinnesota Power’s wholesale electric contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission is effective through December 31, 2037. The wholesale\nelectric service contract with SWL&P is effective through February 29, 2028. Under the agreement with SWL&P, no termination notice has been given.\nThe rates included in these two contracts are set each July 1 based on a cost-based formula methodology, using estimated costs and a rate of return that is\nequal to Minnesota Power’s authorized rate of return for Minnesota retail customers. The formula-based rate methodology also provides for a yearly true-\nup calculation for actual costs incurred.\nMinnesota Power’s wholesale electric contracts with 13 other municipal customers were extended in January 2022 and are effective through 2029. These\ncontracts are based on fixed prices for capacity and energy. The base energy charge for each year is adjusted annually for updated fuel and purchased power\ncosts.\nTransmission Cost Recovery Rider. Minnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider in place to charge retail customers on a current basis for certain\ntransmission investments and expenditures, including a return on the capital invested. Current customer billing rates are based on an MPUC order dated\nMarch 5, 2024. On November 13, 2024, Minnesota Power submitted its latest transmission factor filing. Following approval of the filing by the MPUC,\nMinnesota Power will be authorized to include updated billing rates on customer bills.\nRenewable Cost Recovery Rider. Minnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider in place to charge retail customers on a current basis for the costs of\ncertain renewable investments and expenditures, including a return on the capital invested. Current customer billing rates for the renewable cost recovery\nrider were approved by the MPUC in an order dated June 25, 2024.\nSolar Cost Recovery Rider. Minnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider in place to charge retail customers on a current basis for solar costs\nrelated to investments and expenditures for meeting the state of Minnesota’s solar energy standard. Current customer billing rates were approved by the\nMPUC in an order dated December 26, 2023. On October 8, 2024, Minnesota Power submitted its latest solar factor filing. Following approval of the filing\nby the MPUC, Minnesota Power will be authorized to include updated billing rates on customer bills.\nFuel Adjustment Clause. Fuel and purchased power costs related to Minnesota Power’s retail customers are recovered from customers through the fuel\nadjustment clause. The method of accounting for all Minnesota electric utilities is a monthly budgeted, forward-looking fuel adjustment clause with annual\nprudence review and true-up to actual allowed costs.\nMinnesota Power incurred higher fuel and purchased power costs in 2022 than those factored in its fuel adjustment forecast filed in May 2021 for 2022,\nwhich resulted in the recognition of an approximately $13 million regulatory asset as of December 31, 2022. The MPUC approved recovery of the\nregulatory asset in an order dated July 31, 2023; recovery of the regulatory asset began in the third quarter of 2023 and ended in mid-2024.\nMinnesota Power incurred lower fuel and purchased power costs in 2023 than those factored in its fuel adjustment forecast filed in May 2022 for 2023,\nwhich resulted in the recognition of a $15.5 million regulatory liability as of December 31, 2023. Minnesota Power requested to refund the regulatory\nliability over 12 months beginning in the third quarter of 2024 as part of its annual true-up filing submitted to the MPUC on March 1, 2024. In an order\ndated July 1, 2024, the MPUC approved the filing, and authorized Minnesota Power to refund the regulatory liability over 12 months beginning on\nSeptember 1, 2024.\nMinnesota Power incurred higher fuel and purchased power costs in 2024 than those factored in its fuel adjustment forecast filed in May 2023 for 2024,\nwhich resulted in the recognition of a $4.5 million regulatory asset as of December 31, 2024. Minnesota Power expects to request recovery of the\nregulatory asset as part of its annual true-up filing with the MPUC in March 2025.\nMinnesota Power’s filed its annual forecasted fuel and purchased power rates for 2025 on May 1, 2024, which was subsequently approved by the MPUC in\nan order dated November 8, 2024. The fuel and purchased power rates for Minnesota Power retail customers are based on this filing beginning January 1,\n2025.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n98\nNOTE 4. REGULATORY MATTERS (Continued)\nElectric Rates (Continued)\nDeferred Accounting Petition. On December 30, 2024, Minnesota Power submitted a petition with the MPUC seeking deferral accounting treatment for\ninvestigative costs and the increase in depreciation expense resulting from compliance costs that will be incurred related to the new Coal Combustion Rule\n(CCR) Legacy Rule, which was published in the Federal Register on May 8, 2024. (See Note 9. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nCompliance with the CCR Legacy Rule is expected to result in a significant increase to our MPUC-approved decommissioning costs for Boswell and\nLaskin. If the MPUC approves our request for deferral accounting treatment, these costs would be deferred for recovery to our next rate case or other\nregulatory proceeding. In 2024, we recorded depreciation expense related to this rule, of which $4.2 million pre-tax would be moved to a deferred tracking\naccount for MPUC review through a future rate case or other proceeding if the MPUC approves our request for deferral accounting treatment. We are\nunable to predict the outcome of this proceeding.\nWisconsin Retail Rates. SWL&P’s retail rates through 2022 were based on a December 2018 order by the PSCW that allowed for a return on equity of\n10.40 percent and a 55.00 percent equity ratio. The resolution of SWL&P’s 2022 general rate case changed the allowed return on equity to 10.00 percent\nand maintained an equity ratio of 55.00 percent. (See 2022 Wisconsin General Rate Case.) The resolution of SWL&P’s 2024 general rate case further\nchanged the allowed return on equity to 9.80 percent and continued to maintain an equity ratio of 55.00 percent beginning January 1, 2025. (See 2024\nWisconsin General Rate Case.)\n2024 Wisconsin General Rate Case. On March 29, 2024, SWL&P filed a rate increase request for its electric, gas and water utilities with the PSCW. The\nfiling sought an overall return on equity of 10.00 percent and a 55.00 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested change would have\nincreased rates by approximately 5.90 percent for retail customers and generated an estimated $7.3 million of additional revenue. In an order dated\nDecember 12, 2024, the PSCW approved an annual increase of approximately $5.5 million reflecting a return on equity of 9.80 percent and a 55.00 percent\nequity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2025.\n2022 Wisconsin General Rate Case. In an order dated December 20, 2022, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $3.3 million reflecting a return on\nequity of 10.00 percent and a 55.00 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2023.\nIntegrated Resource Plan. On February 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed its latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9,\n2023. The approved IRP, which reflects a joint agreement reached with various stakeholders, outlines Minnesota Power’s clean-energy transition plans\nthrough 2035. These plans include expanding its renewable energy supply, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a\nresilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding up to 700 MW of new wind and solar\nenergy resources, and ceasing coal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Minnesota Power’s plans recognize that advances\nin technology will play a significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. Minnesota Power expects to file\nits next IRP in March 2025.\nSolar Energy Request For Proposals. On October 2, 2023, Minnesota Power filed a notice with the MPUC of its intent to issue a RFP for up to 300 MW of\nsolar energy resources. Minnesota Power issued the RFP on November 15, 2023, which were accepted through January 17, 2024. Minnesota Power\nannounced plans to build an 85 MW solar project and a 119.5 MW solar project in northern Minnesota, both of which are expected to be in service in mid-\n2027, subject to MPUC approval.\nWind Energy Request For Proposals. On December 15, 2023, Minnesota Power filed a notice with the MPUC of its intent to issue a RFP for up to 400 MW\nof wind energy resources. Minnesota Power issued the RFP on February 15, 2024, which were accepted through April 11, 2024.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n99\nNOTE 4. REGULATORY MATTERS (Continued)\nECO Plan. Minnesota requires electric utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5 percent of gross operating revenues, excluding revenue received from exempt\ncustomers, from service provided in the state on ECOs each year. On April 1, 2024, Minnesota Power submitted its 2023 ECO annual filing, formerly\nknown as the conservation improvement program, detailing Minnesota Power’s ECO plan results and proposed financial incentive, which was approved by\nthe MPUC on November 8, 2024. As a result, Minnesota Power recognized revenue of $2.2 million in 2024 for the approved financial incentive\n($2.2 million in 2023 and $1.9 million in 2022). The financial incentives are recognized in the period in which the MPUC approves the filing.\nOn June 30, 2023, Minnesota Power submitted its triennial filing for 2024 through 2026 to the MPUC and Minnesota Department of Commerce, which\noutlines Minnesota Power’s ECO spending and energy-saving goals for those years. Minnesota Power’s investment goals are $12.7 million for 2025 and\n$12.8 million for 2026.\nMISO Return on Equity Complaints. MISO transmission owners, including ALLETE and ATC, had an authorized return on equity of 10.02 percent, or\n10.52 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization based on a 2020 FERC order which was subject to\nvarious legal challenges related to the return on equity calculation and refund period ordered by the FERC. In August 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the 2020 FERC order back to the FERC. On October 17, 2024, FERC ordered a return on equity of\n9.98 percent, or 10.48 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a RTO, effective September 28, 2016. (See Note 6. Equity Investments.)\nMinnesota Solar Energy Standard. Minnesota law requires at least 1.5 percent of total retail electric sales, excluding sales to certain customers, to be\ngenerated by solar energy. At least 10 percent of the 1.5 percent mandate must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic\ndevices with a nameplate capacity of 40 kW or less and community solar garden subscriptions. Minnesota Power has met both parts of the solar mandate to\ndate.\nMinnesota Distributed Solar Energy Standard. Minnesota law requires at least 3 percent of Minnesota Power’s retail electric sales to be generated from\ndistributed solar energy resources by 2030. Minnesota Power expects to need between 65 MW and 85 MW of distributed solar capacity to meet this\nrequirement. On January 30, 2025, Minnesota Power issued a RFP seeking distributed solar projects as part of its compliance with this distributed solar\nenergy standard. The RFP seeks proposals for solar generating facilities of 10 MW or less that will be connected to Minnesota Power’s distribution system.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities. Our regulated utility operations are subject to accounting standards for the effects of certain types of regulation.\nRegulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable for recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent\nobligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. The Company assesses\nquarterly whether regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. With the exception of the regulatory asset\nfor Boswell Units 1 and 2 net plant and equipment, no other regulatory assets are currently earning a return. The recovery, refund or credit to rates for these\nregulatory assets and liabilities will occur over the periods either specified by the applicable regulatory authority or over the corresponding period related to\nthe asset or liability.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n100\nNOTE 4.

ACQUISITIONS\n2022 Activity\nNew Energy. On April 15, 2022, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ALLETE acquired 100 percent of the membership interests of New Energy for a purchase\nprice of $165.5 million. Total consideration of approximately $158.8 million was paid in cash on the acquisition date, which is net of cash acquired and\ndebt assumed. New Energy, which is headquartered in Annapolis, Maryland, is a renewable energy development company with a primary focus on solar\nand storage facilities while also offering comprehensive operations, maintenance and asset management services. The acquisition of New Energy is\nconsistent with ALLETE’s stated strategy of additional investment in renewable energy and related infrastructure across North America to support the\nCompany’s sustainability-in-action strategy while providing potential long-term earnings growth.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the purchase price was allocated based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired\nand the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price, which was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2022, is shown in the\nfollowing table. Fair value measurements were valued primarily using the discounted cash flow method and replacement cost basis. The goodwill recorded\nis primarily attributable to the highly skilled workforce of New Energy and synergies expected to arise as a result of the acquisition.\nThe Company has not presented separate results of operations since closing or combined pro forma financial information of the Company and New Energy\nsince the beginning of 2021, as the results of operations for New Energy are not material to the Company's consolidated financials.\nMillions\nAssets Acquired\nCash and Cash Equivalents $3.9 \nAccounts Receivable 1.4 \nInventory (a) 25.3 \nOther Current Assets 12.8 \nProperty, Plant and Equipment - Net 16.4 \nGoodwill (b) 154.9 \nOther Non-Current Assets 2.1 \nTotal Assets Acquired $216.8 \nLiabilities Assumed\nCurrent Liabilities $23.6 \nLong-Term Debt Due Within One Year 28.3 \nLong-Term Debt 5.9 \nOther Non-Current Liabilities 0.2 \nTotal Liabilities Assumed $58.0 \nNet Identifiable Assets Acquired $158.8 \n(a) Includes $1 1.6 million of pur chase price accounting for certain pr ojects under development at the time of acquisition.\n(b) For tax purpose, the pur chase price allocation r esulted in $154.9 million of deductible goodwill.\nAcquisition-related costs were $2.7 million after-tax, expensed as incurred during 2022 and recorded in Operating and Maintenance on the Consolidated\nStatement of Income.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n102\nNOTE 6.

FAIR VALUE\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date (exit price). We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including\nassumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or\ngenerally unobservable. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to utilize the best available\ninformation. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These\ninputs, which are used to measure fair value, are prioritized through the fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The\nthree levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. Active markets are those in which\ntransactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes\nprimarily equity securities.\nLevel 2 — Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of\nassets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities with pricing\ninterpolated from recent trades of similar securities, or priced with models using highly observable inputs, such as commodity options priced using\nobservable forward prices and volatilities. This category includes deferred compensation and fixed income securities.\nLevel 3 — Significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with\ninputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as the complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n104\nNOTE 7. FAIR VALUE (Continued)\nThe following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy, our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as\nof December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Each asset and liability is classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, which may affect the valuation of\nthese assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The estimated fair value of Cash and Cash Equivalents listed on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet approximates the carrying amount and therefore is excluded from the recurring fair value measures in the following tables.\n Fair Value as of December 31, 2024\nRecurring Fair Value Measures Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nMillions     \nAssets:     \nInvestments (a)\nAvailable-for-sale – Equity Securities $8.6 — — $8.6\nAvailable-for-sale – Corporate and Governmental Debt Securities (b) — $6.8 — 6.8\nCash Equivalents 8.5 — — 8.5\nTotal Fair Value of Assets $17.1 $6.8 — $23.9\nLiabilities:     \nDeferred Compensation (c) — $21.1 — $21.1\nTotal Fair Value of Liabilities — $21.1 — $21.1\n(a) Included in Other Non-Curr ent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) As of December 31, 2024, the aggr egate amount of available-for -sale corporate and governmental debt securities maturing in one year or less was $2.0 million, in one\nyear to less than thr ee years was $2.8 million, in thr ee years to less than five years was $1.5 million and in five or mor e years was $0.5 million.\n(c) Included in Other Non-Curr ent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n Fair Value as of December 31, 2023\nRecurring Fair Value Measures Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nMillions     \nAssets:     \nInvestments (a)\nAvailable-for-sale – Equity Securities $8.7 — — $8.7\nAvailable-for-sale – Corporate and Governmental Debt Securities — $6.0 — 6.0\nCash Equivalents 5.8 — — 5.8\nTotal Fair Value of Assets $14.5 $6.0 — $20.5\nLiabilities: (b)     \nDeferred Compensation — $16.5 — $16.5\nTotal Fair Value of Liabilities — $16.5 — $16.5\n(a) Included in Other Non-Curr ent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Included in Other Non-Curr ent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of levels as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the\ntransfer. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. With the exception of the item listed in the following table, the estimated fair value of all financial instruments\napproximates the carrying amount.

Non-financial assets such as equity method investments, goodwill, intangible\nassets, and property, plant and equipment are measured at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment and recorded at fair value only when an\nimpairment is recognized.\nEquity Method Investments. The aggregate carrying amount of our equity investments was $340.1 million as of December 31, 2024 ($331.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023).

The Company assesses the impairment of property, plant, and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment assets may not be recoverable. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting\nPolicies.) For the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, there was no impairment of property, plant, and equipment.\nWe believe that long-standing ratemaking practices approved by applicable state and federal regulatory commissions allow for the recovery of the\nremaining book value of retired plant assets. The MPUC order for Minnesota Power’s 2015 IRP directed Minnesota Power to retire Boswell Units 1 and 2,\nwhich occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. As part of the 2016 general retail rate case, the MPUC allowed recovery of the remaining book value of\nBoswell Units 1 and 2 through 2022. Minnesota Power’s latest IRP, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 9, 2023, includes ceasing\ncoal operations at Boswell Units 3 and 4 by 2030 and 2035, respectively. Boswell Unit 3 and Unit 4 have a net book value of approximately $220 million\nand $395 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) Minnesota Power also retired Taconite Harbor in the first\nquarter of 2023 consistent with its latest IRP. As part of the 2022 general retail rate case, the MPUC allowed recovery of the remaining book value of\nTaconite Harbor through 2026. We do not expect to record any impairment charge as a result of these operating changes at Taconite Harbor and Boswell. In\naddition, we expect to be able to continue depreciating these assets for at least their established remaining useful lives; however, we are unable to predict\nthe impact of regulatory outcomes resulting in changes to their established remaining useful lives.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n106\nNOTE 8. SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT\nShort-Term Debt. As of December 31, 2024, total short-term debt outstanding was $94.7 million ($111.4 million as of December 31, 2023), and consisted\nof long-term debt due within one year and included no unamortized debt issuance costs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had consolidated bank lines of credit aggregating to $362.0 million ($423.1 million as of December 31, 2023), most of which\nexpire in January 2027. We had $16.2 million outstanding in standby letters of credit and $20.0 million outstanding draws under our lines of credit as of\nDecember 31, 2024 ($19.4 million in standby letters of credit and $34.1 million outstanding draws as of December 31, 2023).\nLong-Term Debt. As of December 31, 2024, total long-term debt outstanding was $1,704.7 million ($1,679.9 million as of December 31, 2023) and\nincluded $8.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing in 2025 is $94.7 million; $80.2 million in\n2026; $182.5 million in 2027; $55.8 million in 2028; $220.3 million in 2029; and $1,174.5 million thereafter. Substantially all of our regulated electric\nplant is subject to the lien of the mortgages collateralizing outstanding first mortgage bonds. The mortgages contain non-financial covenants customary in\nutility mortgages, including restrictions on our ability to incur liens, dispose of assets, and merge with other entities.\nMinnesota Power is obligated to make financing payments for the Camp Ripley solar array totaling $1.4 million annually during the financing term, which\nexpires in 2027. Minnesota Power has the option at the end of the financing term to renew for a two-year term, or to purchase the solar array for\napproximately $4 million. Minnesota Power anticipates exercising the purchase option when the term expires.\nOn April 23, 2024, ALLETE issued $100 million of its First Mortgage Bonds (Bonds) to certain institutional buyers in the private placement market. The\nBonds, which bear interest at 5.72 percent, will mature on April 30, 2039 and pay interest semi-annually in April and October of each year, commencing on\nOctober 30, 2024. ALLETE has the option to prepay all or a portion of the Bonds at its discretion, subject to a make-whole provision. The Bonds are\nsubject to additional terms and conditions which are customary for these types of transactions. Proceeds from the sale of the Bonds were used to refinance\nexisting indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The Bonds were sold in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, to institutional accredited investors.\nOn July 31, 2024, ALLETE issued a notice to the holders of its 2.65 percent senior notes due September 10, 2025, (“2025 Notes”) regarding the\nCompany’s exercise of its option to prepay all of the issued and outstanding 2025 Notes. ALLETE prepaid all $150 million in aggregate principal amount\nof the 2025 Notes on September 5, 2024. The 2025 Notes were prepaid at 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn September 5, 2024, ALLETE issued and sold $150 million of senior unsecured notes (“Notes”) to certain institutional buyers in the private placement\nmarket. The Notes were sold in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to institutional\naccredited investors. Of the Notes issued and sold, $100 million of the Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.94 percent and mature on September 5, 2029, and\n$50 million of the Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.18 percent and mature on September 5, 2034. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on\nMarch 5 and September 5 of each year, commencing on March 5, 2025. The Company has the option to prepay all or a portion of the Notes at its discretion,\nsubject to a make-whole provision. The Notes are subject to additional terms and conditions which are customary for these types of transactions. Proceeds\nfrom the sale of the Notes were used for refinancing of debt and general corporate purposes.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, we may incur certain forms of indebtedness only with the written consent of Alloy Parent.

SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT (Continued)\nLong-Term Debt (Continued)\nFinancial Covenants. Our long-term debt arrangements contain customary covenants. In addition, our lines of credit and letters of credit supporting certain\nlong-term debt arrangements contain financial covenants. Our compliance with financial covenants is not dependent on debt ratings. The most restrictive\nfinancial covenant requires ALLETE to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization (as the amounts are calculated in accordance with the\nrespective long-term debt arrangements) of less than or equal to 0.65 to 1.00, measured quarterly. As of December 31, 2024, our ratio was approximately\n0.36 to 1.00. Failure to meet this covenant would give rise to an event of default if not cured after notice from the lender, in which event ALLETE may\nneed to pursue alternative sources of funding. Some of ALLETE’s debt arrangements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in an event of\ndefault if there is a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that would result in an acceleration of\npayments due. ALLETE has no significant restrictions on its ability to pay dividends from retained earnings or net income; however, under the Merger\nAgreement, the Company has agreed not to declare or pay dividends except for quarterly cash dividends payable by us in respect of shares of our common\nstock on a schedule consistent with our past practices in an amount not to exceed 5 percent per share more than the dividend payable during the prior 12-\nmonth period, subject to certain other exceptions. (See Note 15. Agreement and Plan of Merger.) As of December 31, 2024, ALLETE was in compliance\nwith its financial covenants.\nNOTE 9.

Our long-term PPAs have been evaluated under the accounting guidance for variable interest entities. We have\ndetermined that either we have no variable interest in the PPAs, or where we do have variable interests, we are not the primary beneficiary; therefore,\nconsolidation is not required. These conclusions are based on the fact that we do not have both control over activities that are most significant to the entity\nand an obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity’s performance. Our financial exposure relating to these PPAs is limited to our capacity\nand energy payments.\nThese agreements have also been evaluated under the accounting guidance for derivatives. We have determined that either these agreements are not\nderivatives, or, if they are derivatives, these agreements qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception to derivative accounting guidance;\ntherefore, derivative accounting is not required.\nSquare Butte PPA. Minnesota Power has a PPA with Square Butte that extends through 2026 (Agreement). Minnesota Power is obligated to pay its pro rata\nshare of Square Butte’s costs based on its entitlement to the output of Square Butte’s 455 MW coal fired generating unit. Minnesota Power’s output\nentitlement under the Agreement is 50 percent for the remainder of the Agreement, subject to the provisions of the Minnkota Power PSA described in the\nfollowing table. Minnesota Power’s payment obligation will be suspended if Square Butte fails to deliver any power, whether produced or purchased, for a\nperiod of one year. Square Butte’s costs consist primarily of debt service, operating and maintenance, depreciation and fuel expenses. As of December 31,\n2024, Square Butte had total debt outstanding of $168.9 million. Annual debt service for Square Butte is expected to be approximately $30.6 million in\n2025 and $32.1 million in 2026 of which Minnesota Power’s obligation is 50 percent. Fuel expenses are recoverable through Minnesota Power’s fuel\nadjustment clause and include the cost of coal purchased from BNI Energy under a long-term contract.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n109\nNOTE 9. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)\nPower Purchase and Sales Agreements (Continued)\nMinnesota Power’s cost of power purchased from Square Butte during 2024 was $87.7 million ($86.2 million in 2023; $82.7 million in 2022). This reflects\nMinnesota Power’s pro rata share of total Square Butte costs based on the 50 percent output entitlement. Included in this amount was Minnesota Power’s\npro rata share of interest expense of $4.9 million in 2024 ($5.5 million in 2023; $5.1 million in 2022). Minnesota Power’s payments to Square Butte are\napproved as a purchased power expense for ratemaking purposes by both the MPUC and the FERC.\nMinnesota Power has also entered into the following long-term PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy as of December 31, 2024:\nCounterparty Quantity Product Commencement Expiration Pricing\nPPAs\nCalpine Corporation 25 MW Capacity June 2019 May 2026 Fixed\nManitoba Hydro\nPPA 1 250 MW Capacity / Energy June 2020 May 2035 (a)\nPPA 2 133 MW Energy June 2020 June 2040 Forward Market Prices\nNobles 2 250 MW Capacity / Energy December 2020 December 2040 Fixed\nOliver Wind I (b) Energy December 2006 December 2040 Fixed\nOliver Wind II (b) Energy December 2007 December 2040 Fixed\n(a) The capacity price was adjusted annually until 2020  by the change in a governmental inflationary index.

Minnesota Power has coal supply agreements providing for the purchase of a significant portion of its coal\nrequirements through December 2027. Minnesota Power also has coal transportation agreements in place for the delivery of a significant portion of its coal\nrequirements through December 2027. The costs of fuel and related transportation costs for Minnesota Power’s generation are recoverable from Minnesota\nPower’s utility customers through the fuel adjustment clause.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n110\nNOTE 9. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)\nEnvironmental Matters.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state, and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the\nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities over the\npast several years. Minnesota Power’s facilities are subject to additional requirements under many of these regulations. Minnesota Power is reshaping its\ngeneration portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and\npolicy during rulemaking implementation.\nWe consider our businesses to be in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and believe all necessary permits have been\nobtained. We anticipate that with many state and federal environmental regulations and requirements finalized, or to be finalized in the near future,\npotential expenditures for future environmental matters may be material and require significant capital investments. Minnesota Power has evaluated various\nenvironmental compliance scenarios using possible outcomes of environmental regulations to project power supply trends and impacts on customers.\nWe review environmental matters on a quarterly basis. Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. Accruals are adjusted as assessment\nand remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. Costs related to\nenvironmental contamination treatment and cleanup are expensed unless recoverable in rates from customers.\nAir. The electric utility industry is regulated both at the federal and state level to address air emissions. Minnesota Power’s thermal generating facilities\nmainly burn low-sulfur western sub-bituminous coal, as well as natural gas and biomass. All of Minnesota Power’s coal-fired generating facilities are\nequipped with pollution control equipment such as scrubbers, baghouses and low NO technologies. Under currently applicable environmental regulations,\nthese facilities are substantially compliant with emission requirements.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). The CSAPR requires certain states in the eastern half of the U.S., including Minnesota, to reduce power plant\nemissions that contribute to ozone or fine particulate pollution in other states. The CSAPR does not require installation of controls but does require\nfacilities have sufficient allowances to cover their emissions on an annual basis. These allowances are allocated to facilities from each state’s annual budget\nand can be bought and sold. Based on our review of the NO and SO allowances issued and pending issuance as well as consideration of current rules, we\ncurrently expect generation levels and emission rates will result in continued compliance with the CSAPR. Minnesota Power will continue to monitor\nongoing CSAPR rulemakings and compliance implementation, including the EPA’s Good Neighbor Rule which modifies certain aspects of the CSAPR’s\nprogram scope and extent (see EPA Good Neighbor Plan for 2015 Ozone NAAQS).\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The EPA is required to review each NAAQS every five years. If the EPA determines that a state’s air\nquality is not in compliance with the NAAQS, the state is required to adopt plans describing how it will reduce emissions to attain the NAAQS. Minnesota\nPower actively monitors NAAQS developments, and the EPA has recently reassessed several primary and secondary NAAQS for NOx, SO, and\nparticulate matter. Implementation of the EPA’s February 2024 final rule lowering the annual primary standard for fine particulate matter began on May 6,\n2024. On December 27, 2024, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register revising the secondary SO NAAQS while retaining the NO and\nparticulate matter secondary standards, with a final rule effective date of January 27, 2025. Anticipated timelines and compliance costs related to this and\nother potential NAAQS revisions cannot yet be estimated but costs could be material. Minnesota Power would seek recovery of additional costs through a\nrate proceeding.X\nX 2\n2\n2 X\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n111\nNOTE 9. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)\nEnvironmental Matters (Continued)\nEPA Good Neighbor Plan for 2015 Ozone NAAQS. On June 5, 2023, after disapproving state implementation plans, the EPA published a final Federal\nImplementation Plan (FIP) rule in the Federal Register, the Good Neighbor Plan, to address regional ozone transport for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS by\nreducing NO emissions during the period of May 1 through September 30 (ozone season). In its justification for the final rule, the EPA asserted that 23\nstates, including Minnesota, were modeled as significant contributors to downwind states’ challenges in attaining or maintaining ozone NAAQS\ncompliance within their state borders. The Good Neighbor Plan is designed to resolve this interstate transport issue by implementing a variety of NO\nreduction strategies, including federal implementation plan requirements, NO emission limitations, and ozone season allowance program requirements.\nThe final rule imposed restrictions on fossil-fuel fired power plants in 22 states and on certain industrial sources in 20 states, with implementation\noccurring through changes to the existing CSAPR program for power plants.\nSince the EPA partially disapproved the Good Neighbor State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, among others,\nMinnesota became subject to the final Good Neighbor Plan. However, Minnesota Power and a coalition of other Minnesota utilities and industry (the\nparties) co-filed challenges to the EPA’s final Minnesota SIP disapproval, submitting a petition for reconsideration and stay to the EPA, and a petition for\njudicial review to the Eighth Circuit Court. The parties are challenging and requesting reconsideration of certain technical components of the EPA’s review\nand subsequent partial disapproval of the state of Minnesota’s SIP. On July 5, 2023, the Eighth Circuit Court granted a stay of the SIP disapproval\npreventing the Good Neighbor Plan from taking effect in Minnesota; oral arguments occurred on October 22, 2024. On April 4, 2024, the EPA published a\npartial denial of several administrative reconsideration and stay petitions, including from the Minnesota coalition. On September 29, 2023, the EPA issued\nan updated final interim rule addressing the stays in Minnesota and five other states, formally delaying the effective date of the final FIP for states with\nactive stays in place. The state of Minnesota therefore did not become subject to compliance obligations for the 2023 or 2024 ozone seasons.\nFuture compliance obligations will depend on resolution of the stay and outcomes of related litigation. Additional challenges have been filed against the\nfinal FIP rule by the Minnesota coalition parties and other entities, although the Minnesota coalition FIP challenge is currently in abeyance pending\nresolution of the SIP disapproval case. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court granted an emergency stay of the FIP rule requested by several states and\nindustry groups, staying enforcement pending the D.C. Circuit’s review and any petition for writ of certiorari. In response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s stay\norder, the EPA published a third interim rule in the Federal Register on November 6, 2024, staying the effectiveness of the Good Neighbor FIP in the 10\nremaining covered states, including Wisconsin. Anticipated timelines and compliance costs related to final Good Neighbor Plan compliance cannot yet be\nestimated due to uncertainties about SIP approval resolution, implementation timing, FIP rule outcome, and allowance costs and facility emissions during\nthe ozone season. However, the costs could be material, including costs of additional NOx controls, emission allowance program participation, or\noperational changes, if any are required. Minnesota Power would seek recovery of additional costs through a rate proceeding.\nEPA National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters\n(Industrial Boiler MACT) Rule. A final rule issued by the EPA for Industrial Boiler MACT became effective in 2013 with compliance required at major\nexisting sources in 2016, which applied to Minnesota Power’s Hibbard Renewable Energy Center and Rapids Energy Center. Compliance consisted largely\nof adjustments to fuels and operating practices and compliance costs were not material. After this initial rulemaking, litigation from 2016 through 2018\nresulted in court orders directing that the EPA reconsider certain aspects of the regulation. A final rule incorporating these revisions became effective in\nDecember 2022, with a compliance deadline of October 6, 2025. Compliance costs are not expected to be material.\nEPA Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Rule. On April 25, 2024, the EPA published a final rule to revise the existing 2012 MATS Rule, which\nregulates air emissions of hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electric generating units (EGUs). The final rule eliminates certain MATS\ncompliance flexibility, lowers the particulate emission standard for all coal-fired EGUs, and reduces the mercury emission standard for lignite-fired EGUs.\nThe rule became effective July 8, 2024, with compliance required beginning July 6, 2027. The MATS regulation applies at Minnesota Power’s Boswell\nfacility, which is currently well-controlled for these emissions and already complying with some of the new requirements. The Company anticipates the\nnew rule will not have material impacts at Boswell. However, compliance costs cannot yet be fully estimated, and recovery of any additional costs would\nbe sought through a rate proceeding. Litigation against the EPA’s latest MATS Rule revision from a number of U.S. states as well as several companies and\nindustry groups is ongoing. Motions to stay the rule were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on August 6, 2024, and the U.S.\nSupreme Court on October 4, 2024.X\nX\nX\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n112\nNOTE 9. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)\nEnvironmental Matters (Continued)\nClimate Change. The scientific community generally accepts that emissions of GHGs are linked to global climate change which creates physical and\nfinancial risks. Physical risks could include but are not limited to: increased or decreased precipitation and water levels in lakes and rivers; increased or\nother changes in temperatures; increased risk of wildfires; and changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. These all have the\npotential to affect the Company’s business and operations. We are addressing climate change by taking the following steps that also ensure reliable and\nenvironmentally compliant generation resources to meet our customers’ requirements:\n•Expanding renewable power supply for both our operations and the operations of others;\n•Providing energy conservation initiatives for our customers and engaging in other demand side management efforts;\n•Improving efficiency of our generating facilities;\n•Supporting research of technologies to reduce carbon emissions from generating facilities and carbon sequestration efforts;\n•Evaluating and developing less carbon intensive future generating assets such as efficient and flexible natural gas ‑ fired generating facilities;\n•Managing vegetation on right-of-way corridors to reduce potential wildfire or storm damage risks; and\n•Practicing sound forestry management in our service territories to create landscapes more resilient to disruption from climate-related changes,\nincluding planting and managing long-lived conifer species.\nEPA Regulation of GHG Emissions. On April 25, 2024, the EPA issued several final greenhouse gas regulations to establish emissions standards and\nguidelines for fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs) under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The final rules revise new source\nperformance standards (NSPS) for new, modified and reconstructed EGUs (Section 111(b) of the CAA) and creates new emission guidelines for existing\nEGUs (Section 111(d) of the CAA). The action also officially repeals the predecessor regulation “Affordable Clean Energy Rule”, first issued in 2019 and\nlater vacated in 2021. Compliance will be required beginning January 1, 2030, for existing sources, and upon commencing operation of new units. The\n111(d) rule also requires states to submit plans to provide for the establishment, implementation and enforcement of performance standards for existing\nsources. States must submit either a state plan or negative declaration letter to the EPA by May 11, 2026.\nThe final Section 111 rules apply to several Company assets, including existing EGUs at the Boswell and Laskin facilities as well as the proposed\ncombined cycle natural gas-fired generating facility, Nemadji Trail Energy Center. The Company anticipates compliance with the rules may require\noperational or planning adjustments. The state implementation plan process for Section 111(d) existing units will also be a factor in determining specific\nrequirements and timing. We are unable to predict compliance costs at this time; however, the costs could be material. Minnesota Power would seek\nrecovery of additional costs through a rate proceeding. The Company is also monitoring litigation of the final Section 111 rules, which began when the\nrules were published in the Federal Register on May 9, 2024, and continues in federal court. Both the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court have\ndeclined requests to block the rule from becoming effective while litigation is ongoing. Oral arguments in the D.C. Circuit occurred on December 6, 2024,\nwith a merits decision currently expected by mid-2025. Outcomes from ongoing litigation may impact both the timing of rule effectiveness and the ultimate\ncompliance obligations required by the rule.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n113\nNOTE 9. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)\nEnvironmental Matters (Continued)\nWater. The Clean Water Act requires NPDES permits be obtained from the EPA or delegated state agencies for any wastewater discharged into navigable\nwaters. We have obtained all necessary NPDES permits, including NPDES storm water permits for applicable facilities, to conduct our operations.\nSteam Electric Power Generating Effluent Limitations Guidelines. In 2015, the EPA issued revised federal effluent limitation guidelines (ELG) for steam\nelectric power generating stations under the Clean Water Act. It set effluent limits and prescribed Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for several\nwastewater streams, including flue gas desulphurization (FGD) water, bottom ash transport water and coal combustion landfill leachate. In October 2020,\nthe EPA published a final ELG Rule allowing re-use of bottom ash transport water in FGD scrubber systems with limited discharges related to maintaining\nsystem water balance. The rule set technology standards and numerical pollutant limits for discharges of bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater.\nCompliance deadlines depend on subcategory, with compliance generally required as soon as possible, beginning after October 13, 2021, but no later than\nDecember 31, 2025, or December 31, 2028, in some specific cases.\nOn May 9, 2024, the EPA finalized revisions to the 2020 ELG rule. The final rule establishes zero discharge limitations for bottom ash transport water,\nFGD wastewater, and combustion residual leachate. A definition for legacy wastewater was established, with deferral to state permit programs for setting\ndischarge limits based on best professional judgment. The rule maintains exemptions for units permanently ceasing coal combustion by 2028 and adds a\nnew subcategory for units that are retiring by 2032 and have already complied with either the 2015 or 2020 ELG rules. Additionally, the rule establishes\nmercury and arsenic limitations for functionally equivalent discharges of leachate via groundwater to surface water. Compliance deadlines are determined\nby the applicable state permitting authority through permit incorporation as soon as July 8, 2024, but no later than December 31, 2029.\nBottom ash transport and FGD wastewater ELGs are not expected to have a significant impact on Minnesota Power operations. Zero leachate discharge\nrequirements have the potential to impact dewatering associated with the closed Taconite Harbor dry ash landfill. New limitations for arsenic and mercury\nrelated to functionally equivalent (groundwater to surface water) discharges are not currently anticipated to impact Minnesota Power facilities.\nWe estimate no additional material compliance costs for ELG bottom ash water and FGD requirements. Compliance costs we might incur related to other\nELG waste streams (e.g., leachate) or other potential future water discharge regulations at Minnesota Power facilities cannot be estimated; however, the\ncosts could be material, including costs associated with wastewater treatment and re-use. Minnesota Power would seek recovery of additional costs through\na rate proceeding.\nPermitted Water Discharges – Sulfate. In 2017, the MPCA released a draft water quality standard in an attempt to update Minnesota’s existing 10 mg/L\nsulfate limit for waters used for the production of wild rice with the proposed rulemaking heard before an administrative law judge (ALJ). In 2018, the ALJ\nrejected significant portions of the proposed rulemaking and the MPCA subsequently withdrew the rulemaking. The existing 10 mg/L limit remains in\nplace, but the MPCA is currently prohibited under state law from listing wild rice waters as impaired or requiring sulfate reduction technology.\nThe federal Clean Water Act requires the MPCA to update the state's impaired water list every two years. Beginning in 2021 through the latest release\napproved by the EPA in April 2024, this list now includes Minnesota lakes and streams identified as wild rice waters that are listed for sulfate impairment.\nThe list could subsequently be used to set sulfate limits in discharge permits for power generation facilities and municipal and industrial customers,\nincluding paper and pulp facilities, and mining operations. At this time, we are unable to determine the specific impacts these developments may have on\nMinnesota Power operations or its customers, if any. Minnesota Power would seek recovery of additional costs through a rate proceeding.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n114\nNOTE 9. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)\nEnvironmental Matters (Continued)\nSolid and Hazardous Waste. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 regulates the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.\nWe are required to notify the EPA of hazardous waste activity and, consequently, routinely submit reports to the EPA.\nCoal Ash Management Facilities. Minnesota Power produces the majority of its coal ash at Boswell, with small amounts of ash generated at Hibbard\nRenewable Energy Center. Ash storage and disposal methods include storing ash in clay-lined onsite impoundments (ash ponds), disposing of dry ash in a\nlined dry ash landfill, applying ash to land as an approved beneficial use, and trucking ash to state permitted landfills.\nBoswell Ash Wastewater Spill. On August 12, 2024, Minnesota Power received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the MPCA, related to the spill at Boswell\nfrom a pipeline carrying ash wastewater from an inactive onsite storage pond to Blackwater Creek, which the Company reported on July 16, 2024.\nMinnesota Power responded to the MPCA NOV, clarifying certain statements made by the MPCA, as well as providing a written report and required plans.\nWe are awaiting a proposed Stipulation Agreement from the MPCA. Minnesota Power continues to work with state and federal agencies to evaluate and\nmitigate the impacts from this event. We are unable to predict the mitigation or other costs related to the ash wastewater spill at this time; however, the\ncosts could be material.\nCoal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities (CCR). In 2015, the EPA published a final rule (2015 Rule) regulating CCR as nonhazardous waste\nunder Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in the Federal Register. The rule included additional requirements for new\nlandfill and impoundment construction as well as closure activities related to certain existing impoundments. Costs of compliance for Boswell and Laskin\nare expected to be incurred primarily over the next 12 years and be between approximately $65 million and $120 million. Compliance costs for CCR at\nTaconite Harbor are not expected to be material. Minnesota Power would seek recovery of additional costs through a rate proceeding.\nMinnesota Power continues to work on minimizing compliance costs through evaluation of beneficial re-use and recycling of CCR. In 2018, a U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Columbia decision vacated specific provisions of the CCR rule, which resulted in a change to the status of existing clay-lined\nimpoundments at Boswell being considered unlined. In September 2020, the EPA finalized the CCR Part A Rule, which required all unlined impoundments\nto cease disposal and initiate closure. Upon completion of dry ash conversion activities, Boswell ceased disposal in both impoundments in September 2022.\nBoth impoundments are now inactive and have initiated closure.\nOn May 8, 2024, the EPA's final CCR Legacy Impoundment Rule was published in the Federal Register. The final rule expands the scope of units regulated\nunder the CCR rule to include legacy ponds (inactive surface impoundments at inactive facilities) and creates a new category of units called CCR\nmanagement units (CCRMU), which includes inactive and closed impoundments and landfills as well as other non-containerized accumulations of CCR.\nThe final rule requires all regulated generating facilities to evaluate and identify past deposits of CCR materials on their sites and close or re-close existing\nCCR units to meet current closure standards, as well as install groundwater monitoring systems, conduct groundwater monitoring, and implement\ngroundwater corrective actions as necessary. The Final Rule requires a Facility Evaluation Report by February 2027, which will identify regulated units and\napplicable requirements. Additionally, the EPA finalized portions of the proposed CCR Part B Rule, which allows CCR units to certify closure while\nconducting groundwater remediation activities. Impacts to previously closed CCR units at Boswell and Laskin are anticipated. Compliance costs for\nMinnesota Power’s Boswell and Laskin facilities are estimated to be between approximately $50 million and $85 million and are expected to be incurred\nover the next 10 years based on our preliminary assessment. These estimates may be revised as Minnesota Power completes the required facility\nevaluations. Minnesota Power is expected to seek recovery of these costs through a rate proceeding.\nAdditionally, the EPA released a proposed CCR Part B rulemaking in February 2020 addressing options for beneficial reuse of CCR materials, alternative\nliner demonstrations and other CCR regulatory revisions. Portions of the Part B rule addressing alternative liner equivalency standards were finalized in\nNovember 2020. A final rule establishing the remaining CCR beneficial reuse requirements is expected but has been moved to EPA’s long term\nrulemakings, without a publication target date currently. According to its latest Unified Agenda, the EPA had planned to publish the final CCR federal\npermit rule implementing a permitting program for tribal lands and nonparticipating states in December 2024, but that did not occur.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n115\nNOTE 9.

COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)\nOther Matters (Continued)\nCommunity Development District Obligations. In 2005, the Town Center District issued $26.4 million of tax-exempt, 6.0 percent capital improvement\nrevenue bonds. The capital improvement revenue bonds are payable over 31 years (by May 1, 2036) and are secured by special assessments on the\nbenefited land. To the extent that ALLETE Properties still owns land at the time of the assessment, it will incur the cost of its portion of these assessments,\nbased upon its ownership of benefited property.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned 32 percent of the assessable land in the Town Center District (33 percent as of December 31, 2023). As of\nDecember 31, 2024, ownership levels, our annual assessments related to capital improvement and special assessment bonds for the ALLETE Properties\nproject within the district is approximately $0.7 million. As we sell property at this project, the obligation to pay special assessments will pass to the new\nlandowners.

In the first quarter of 2023, an ALLETE Clean Energy subsidiary initiated arbitration proceedings seeking damages against a\ncounterparty for non-performance under a contract. Arbitration hearings were held in June and July 2023, and a final arbitration ruling was issued in favor\nof ALLETE Clean Energy’s subsidiary in September 2023. The final arbitration ruling awarded $68.3 million to ALLETE Clean Energy’s subsidiary,\nwhich included prejudgment interest of $5.1 million, recovery of $3.6 million of arbitration-related costs, and resulted in the recognition of a $58.4 million\npre-tax gain in the third quarter of 2023. The arbitration ruling also resulted in the receipt of approximately $60 million of cash, net of distribution to non-\ncontrolling interest, in the third quarter of 2023.\nMerger-related Complaints.

The unrecognized tax benefit balance includes permanent tax positions which, if recognized, would affect\nthe annual effective income tax rate. In addition, the unrecognized tax benefit balance includes temporary tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility\nis highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. A change in the period of deductibility would not affect the\neffective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

The combined retiree defined\nbenefit pension plan was created in 2016, to include all union and non-union retirees from the existing plans as of January 2016. The plans provide defined\nbenefits based on years of service and final average pay. We made $25.0 million in cash contributions to the plan trusts in 2024 ($17.3 million in 2023;\nnone in 2022). We also have a defined contribution RSOP covering substantially all employees. The 2024 plan year employer contributions totaled $15.7\nmillion ($13.7 million for the 2023 plan year; $12.0 million for the 2022 plan year). (See Note 10. Common Stock and Earnings Per Share and Note 13.\nEmployee Stock and Incentive Plans.)\nThe non-union defined benefit pension plan was frozen in 2018, and does not allow further crediting of service or earnings to the plan. Further, it is closed\nto new participants. The Minnesota Power union defined benefit pension plan is also closed to new participants, and the SWL&P union defined benefit\npension plan was closed to new participants effective February 1, 2022.\nWe have postretirement health care and life insurance plans covering eligible employees. In 2010, the postretirement health care plan was closed to\nemployees hired after January 2011, and the eligibility requirements were amended. The postretirement life plan was amended in 2014 to close the plan to\nnon-union employees retiring after 2015, and in 2018, the plan was amended to limit the benefit level for union employees retiring after 2018. In 2023, the\npostretirement health care plan was amended to change the company contribution to an annual stipend for certain retirees. The postretirement health and\nlife plans are contributory with participant contributions adjusted annually. Postretirement health and life benefits are funded through a combination of\nVoluntary Employee Benefit Association trusts (VEBAs), established under section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, and irrevocable grantor trusts.\nIn 2024, no contributions were made to the VEBAs (none in 2023; none in 2022) and no contributions were made to the grantor trusts (none in 2023; none\nin 2022).\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n121\nNOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)\nManagement considers various factors when making funding decisions such as regulatory requirements, actuarially determined minimum contribution\nrequirements and contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions for the pension plans. Contributions are based on estimates and assumptions which are\nsubject to change. On January 15, 2025, we contributed $19.1 million in cash to the defined benefit pension plans, and do not expect to make additional\ncash contributions to the defined benefit pension plans in 2025. We do not expect to make any contributions to the defined benefit postretirement health and\nlife plans in 2025.\nAccounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of\ntheir defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on their balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of\ntax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.\nThe defined benefit pension and postretirement health and life benefit expense (credit) recognized annually by our regulated utilities are expected to be\nrecovered (refunded) through rates filed with our regulatory jurisdictions. As a result, these amounts that are required to otherwise be recognized in\naccumulated other comprehensive income have been recognized as a long-term regulatory asset (regulatory liability) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, in\naccordance with the accounting standards for the effect of certain types of regulation applicable to our Regulated Operations. The defined benefit pension\nand postretirement health and life benefit expense (credits) associated with our other operations are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome.\nPension Obligation and Funded Status\nAs of December 31 2024 2023\nMillions   \nAccumulated Benefit Obligation $701.7 $729.5 \nChange in Benefit Obligation   \nObligation, Beginning of Year $746.3 $739.7 \nService Cost 6.6 6.5 \nInterest Cost 38.6 40.5 \nActuarial (Gain) Loss (a) (17.1) 13.9 \nBenefits Paid (61.9) (60.9)\nParticipant Contributions 7.0 6.6 \nObligation, End of Year $719.5 $746.3 \nChange in Plan Assets   \nFair Value, Beginning of Year $589.0 $568.6 \nActual Return on Plan Assets 43.0 55.1 \nEmployer Contribution (b) 34.0 26.2 \nBenefits Paid (61.9) (60.9)\nFair Value, End of Year $604.1 $589.0 \nFunded Status, End of Year $(115.4) $(157.3)\nNet Pension Amounts Recognized in Consolidated Balance Sheet Consist of:   \nCurrent Liabilities $(1.9) $(2.1)\nNon-Current Liabilities $(113.5) $(155.2)\n(a)    The actuarial gain in 2024 was primarily the r esult of incr eases in discount rates.

We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including\nassumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or\ngenerally unobservable. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to utilize the best available\ninformation. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These\ninputs, which are used to measure fair value, are prioritized through the fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).

We sponsor an ESOP within the RSOP. Eligible employees may contribute to the RSOP plan as of their date of hire.\nThe dividends received by the ESOP are distributed to participants. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings.\nESOP employer allocations are funded with contributions paid in either cash or the issuance of ALLETE common stock at the Company’s discretion.

ESOP compensation expense was $15.7 million in 2024\n($13.7 million in 2023; $12.0 million in 2022).\nAccording to the accounting standards for stock compensation, unallocated shares of ALLETE common stock held and purchased by the ESOP were\ntreated as unearned ESOP shares and not considered outstanding for earnings per share computations. All ESOP shares have been allocated to participants\nas of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nStock-Based Compensation.\nStock Incentive Plan. Under our Executive Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (Executive Plan), share-based awards may be issued to key employees\nthrough a broad range of methods, including non-qualified and incentive stock options, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock, restricted\nstock units, stock appreciation rights and other awards. There are 0.7 million shares of ALLETE common stock reserved for issuance under the Executive\nPlan, of which 0.5 million of these shares remain available for issuance as of December 31, 2024.\nThe following types of share-based awards were outstanding in 2024, 2023 or 2022:\nPerformance Shares. Under the performance share awards, the number of shares earned is contingent upon attaining specific market and performance\ngoals over a three-year performance period. Market goals are measured by total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies while\nperformance goals are measured by earnings per share growth. In the case of qualified retirement, death, or disability during a performance period, a\npro rata portion of the award will be earned at the conclusion of the performance period based on the market goals achieved. In the case of termination\nof employment for any reason other than qualified retirement, death, or disability, no award will be earned. If there is a change in control, a pro rata\nportion of the award will be paid based on the greater of actual performance up to the date of the change in control or target performance. The fair\nvalue of these awards incorporates the probability of meeting the total shareholder return goals. Compensation cost is recognized over the three-year\nperformance period based on our estimate of the number of shares which will be earned by the award recipients.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n129\nNOTE 13. EMPLOYEE STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLANS (Continued)\nStock-Based Compensation (Continued)\nRestricted Stock Units. Under the restricted stock unit awards, shares for participants eligible for retirement vest monthly over a three-year period. For\nparticipants not eligible for retirement, shares vest at the end of the three-year period. In the case of qualified retirement, death or disability, a pro rata\nportion of the award will be earned. In the case of termination of employment for any reason other than qualified retirement, death or disability, no\naward will be earned. If there is a change in control, a pro rata portion of the award will be earned. The fair value of these awards is equal to the grant\ndate fair value. Compensation cost is recognized over the three-year vesting period based on our estimate of the number of shares which will be earned\nby the award recipients.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Under our ESPP, eligible employees may purchase ALLETE common stock at a 5 percent discount from the\nmarket price; we are not required to apply fair value accounting to these awards as the discount is not greater than 5 percent.\nRSOP. The RSOP is a contributory defined contribution plan subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as\namended, and qualifies as an employee stock ownership plan and profit sharing plan. The RSOP provides eligible employees an opportunity to save for\nretirement.\nThe following share-based compensation expense amounts were recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the periods presented.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nYear Ended December 31 2024 2023 2022\nMillions    \nPerformance Shares $1.8 $3.1 $0.7 \nRestricted Stock Units 0.9 0.8 0.9 \nTotal Share-Based Compensation Expense $2.7 $3.9 $1.6 \nIncome Tax Benefit $0.8 $1.1 $0.5 \nThere were no capitalized share-based compensation costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost for the performance share awards and restricted stock units not yet recognized in our\nConsolidated Statement of Income was $3.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER\nOn May 5, 2024, ALLETE entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth\ntherein, Alloy Merger Sub will merge with and into ALLETE, with ALLETE continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and becoming a\nsubsidiary of Alloy Parent.\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of ALLETE and\napproved and adopted by the shareholders of ALLETE, at the effective time of the Merger (Effective Time), each share of common stock, without par\nvalue, of ALLETE (ALLETE common stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of ALLETE common\nstock held by any holder who properly exercises dissenters’ rights under Minnesota law in respect of such shares and any shares of ALLETE common\nstock held by an affiliate of Alloy Parent) shall be converted into the right to receive $67.00 in cash, without interest (Merger Consideration). The aggregate\nequity value of the ALLETE common stock acquired by Parent will be approximately $3.9 billion as calculated as of May 5, 2024.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n134\nNOTE 15. AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (Continued)\nIn addition, at the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit (RSU) with respect to ALLETE common stock subject to time-based vesting that is outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the\nMerger Consideration, payable (i) in the case of such right converted from unvested RSUs, upon the same vesting conditions as applied to the\ncorresponding RSU or (ii) in the case of such right converted from vested RSUs, as soon as reasonably practicable following the closing date of the Merger\n(the Closing Date). Each performance share award with respect to ALLETE common stock that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the\nEffective Time and was issued prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive, without interest, the\nMerger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of ALLETE common stock subject to the award, determined based on attainment of the greater of\ntarget and actual performance as of the last business day immediately preceding the Closing Date. A pro rata portion (based on the elapsed portion of the\nperformance period at that time) of these converted performance share awards will be paid out as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing\nDate, with the remainder of the award being subject to time-vesting for the remainder of the applicable performance period. Performance share awards\nissued following the signing of the Merger Agreement will also be cancelled and converted into a contingent right to receive, without interest, the Merger\nConsideration multiplied by the number of shares of ALLETE common stock subject to the performance share award, determined at the target level of\nperformance, and shall be subject to time-based vesting following the Merger. Further, purchase rights accumulated during the offering period in effect\nunder the Company’s ESPP immediately prior to closing will be automatically exercised into shares of ALLETE common stock no later than five business\ndays prior to the Closing Date, and the ESPP will be terminated as of immediately prior to the Closing Date.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including: (1) approval of the shareholders of ALLETE; (2) receipt of all required\nregulatory approvals without the imposition of a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (3) absence of any law or order prohibiting\nthe consummation of the Merger; (4) subject to materiality qualifiers, the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties; (5) each party’s\ncompliance in all material respects with its obligations and covenants under the Merger Agreement; and (6) the absence of a material adverse effect with\nrespect to the Company. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for ALLETE and Alloy Parent, which were described in a Current\nReport of Form 8-K filed by ALLETE on May 6, 2024. In the Merger Agreement, among other things, ALLETE has agreed, subject to certain exceptions,\nto, and to cause each of its subsidiaries to conduct its business in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice, from the date of the Merger Agreement\nuntil the Effective Time, and not to take certain actions prior to the closing of the Merger without the prior written consent of Alloy Parent (which consent\nshall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except where ALLETE seeks Alloy Parent’s consent to enter into a material new line of\nbusiness or cease operations of an existing material line of business). The Merger Agreement also provides that ALLETE may notify Alloy Parent of our\nintent to raise equity capital of up to a total of $300 million in the second half of 2025, subject to certain parameters. If Alloy Parent declines to participate\nin the equity capital raises or fails to provide timely notice with respect thereto, ALLETE will have the right to issue ALLETE common stock in the public\nmarkets for an amount equal to any unfunded amounts under such equity capital raises.\nOn July 10, 2024, ALLETE filed a definitive proxy statement relating to the special meeting of the shareholders held on August 21, 2024. At the special\nmeeting, the shareholders of ALLETE voted to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, among other matters.\nOn July 19, 2024, ALLETE filed requests for approval of the Merger with the MPUC, PSCW and FERC. On October 7, 2024, the MPUC issued an order\nreferring the docket to the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings for a contested case proceeding and requesting the Administrative Law Judge issue\na report and recommendation by July 15, 2025. On January 23, 2025, a Stipulation of Facts and Waiver of Hearing was agreed to by all parties and\nsubmitted to the PSCW. SWL&P expects a PSCW ruling on the acquisition in the second quarter of 2025. ALLETE received approval from FERC on\nDecember 19, 2024. ALLETE also received approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and all required international\napprovals in the third quarter of 2024. On January 31, 2025, ALLETE filed notification and report forms with the Antitrust Division of the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Trade Commission under the HSR Act. Approval of the Merger from these and other regulators, as well as expiration or early\ntermination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, is required for consummation of the Merger.\nALLETE, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K\n135\nNOTE 16.

If any Issuing Bank shall make an LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, then such\nIssuing Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such LC Disbursement and the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by\npaying to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, an amount equal to such LC Disbursement and any accrued\ninterest thereon (collectively, the “Unreimbursed Amount”) by not later than (i) if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC\nDisbursement prior to 11:00 a.m. on such date, 2:00 p.m. on such date, or (ii) otherwise, 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately\nfollowing the day that the Borrower receives such notice. If the Borrower fails to reimburse an Issuing Bank in full for an LC Disbursement\nprior to the time required pursuant to the preceding sentence, then such Issuing Bank may (and the Borrower authorizes such Issuing Bank\nto) request, on behalf of the Borrower by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly advise each Lender), that the Lenders\nfund an ABR Borrowing in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and integral multiple\nrequirements in Section 2.2(c), and each Lender shall make its Loan as part of such ABR Borrowing (by wire transfer of immediately\navailable funds to the account most recently designated by the Administrative Agent for such purpose by notice to the Lenders) not later than\n(x) if such Lender shall have received notice of such Borrowing from the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 noon on such date, 2:00 p.m.\non such date or (y) otherwise, 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately following the day that such Lender receives such notice; provided\nthat if the conditions precedent to a Borrowing specified in Section 5.2 are not satisfied, then the request by the Issuing Bank shall be deemed\nto be a request for the funding of the Lenders’ participations in such Unreimbursed Amount and the amounts made available by the Lenders\nto the Administrative Agent as provided above shall constitute the Lenders’ funding of their respective participations in such\n766170599 11074672    33     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\nUnreimbursed Amount. The Administrative Agent will make the proceeds of such Loans or participations, as applicable, available to the\napplicable Issuing Bank by promptly crediting or otherwise transferring the amounts so received, in like funds, to such Issuing Bank for the\npurpose of repaying in full the LC Disbursement and all accrued interest thereon. Any Lender that fails to make the proceeds of its Loan or\nits participation available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.9(e) shall pay interest thereon, for\nthe account of the applicable Issuing Bank, for each day from and including the date such amount is due to but excluding the date such\namount is received by the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the\nAdministrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.\n(f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of\nthis Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement\nunder any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Loan\nDocument, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,\nfraudulent, insufficient or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) any payment by any\nIssuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of\nCredit, (iv) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or any Loan\nDocument, (v) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower, any other party guaranteeing, or otherwise\nobligated with, such Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any other Person may at any time have against the beneficiary\nunder any Letter of Credit, any Credit Party or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or\nany other related or unrelated agreement or transaction, or (vi) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of any Credit Party or any\nother Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions\nof this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of set-off against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder. Neither\nany Credit Party nor any of their respective Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the\nissuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the\ncircumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any\ndraft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing\nthereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank;\nprovided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct\ndamages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by\napplicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by any Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and\nother documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of\ngross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such\nIssuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the\ngenerality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with\nthe terms of a Letter of Credit, any Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without\nresponsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon\nsuch documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.\n(g) Disbursement Procedures. Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents\npurporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent\nand the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or electronic mail) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has\nmade or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give\n766170599 11074672    34     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\nor delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank and the Lenders with\nrespect to any such LC Disbursement.\n(h) Interim Interest. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse\nsuch LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from\nand including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the\nrate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to\nparagraph (e) of this Section, then Section 3.1(b) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the\napplicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section\nto reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.\n(i) Replacement and Resignation of an Issuing Bank. (i) An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written\nagreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative\nAgent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the\nBorrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.3(b). From and after the\neffective date of any such replacement, (x) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of Issuing Banks under this\nAgreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (y) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to\nrefer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Banks, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.\nAfter the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the\nrights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but\nshall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.\n(j) (ii) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an\nIssuing Bank at any time upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which\ncase, such resigning Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.9(i) above.\n(k) Cash Collateral. In the event that (i) an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing or (ii) any Letter of Credit has\nan expiry date on or after the tenth Business Day prior to the Maturity Date (or any LC Disbursements remain unreimbursed on or after such\ndate), the Borrower shall deposit with the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on the Business Day on which it receives\nnotice from the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral in the case of clause (i), or no later than\nthe tenth Business Day prior to the Maturity Date in the case of clause (ii), an amount equal to the Required Deposit Amount, which amount\nshall be held by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders as cash collateral pursuant to a cash collateral agreement in form and\nsubstance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Banks to secure the Borrower’s reimbursement obligations with\nrespect to LC Disbursements; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such\ndeposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default\ndescribed in paragraph (i) or (j) of Section 8.1. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and\nperformance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control,\nincluding the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Such deposit shall not bear interest, nor shall the Administrative Agent be\nunder any obligation whatsoever to invest the same, provided that, at the request of the Borrower, such deposit shall be invested by the\nAdministrative Agent in direct short term obligations of, or short term obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally\nguaranteed by, the United States of America, in each case maturing no later than the expiry date of the Letter of Credit giving rise to the\nrelevant LC Exposure. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such\n766170599 11074672    35     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\naccount shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not\nbeen reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the\nLC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Required Lenders), be applied to\nsatisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder\nas a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower\nwithin three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide cash collateral\nhereunder as a result of clause (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph, the amount thereof (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be\nreturned to the Borrower when the LC Exposure is zero and all applicable Letters of Credit shall have been returned to the applicable Issuing\nBanks and shall have been cancelled.\n(l) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.9 to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then\nthe provisions of Section 2.11 shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender.\nSection 2.10.Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.\n(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document\n(whether of principal of Loans, LC Disbursements, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 10.3, or otherwise)\nprior to 1:00 p.m. on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such\ntime on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day\nfor purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its office at 10 S. Dearborn,\nChicago, Illinois, or such other office as to which the Administrative Agent may notify the other parties hereto, except that payments\npursuant to Sections 3.3(b) (with respect to the fronting fee and other amounts payable to the Issuing Banks), 3.3(c), 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 10.3\nshall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the\naccount of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day\nthat is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment\naccruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.\n(b) Each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans,\neach payment of fees, each reduction of the Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a\nBorrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments (or, if\nsuch Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans).\nEach Lender agrees that in computing such Lender’s portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its\ndiscretion, round each Lender’s percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount. If at any time insufficient\nfunds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal of Loans, unreimbursed LC\nDisbursements, interest, fees and commissions then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest, fees and\ncommissions then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest, fees and commissions\nthen due to such parties and (ii) second, towards payment of principal of Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,\nratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal of Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then\ndue to such parties.\n(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any\nprincipal of, or interest on, any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater\nproportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest\n766170599 11074672    36     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\nthereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face\nvalue) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all\nsuch payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of, and accrued interest on, their\nrespective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of\nthe payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such\nrecovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower\npursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the\nassignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or Participant, other than to\nthe Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the\nforegoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the\nforegoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if\nsuch Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.\n(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any\npayment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Credit Parties hereunder that the Borrower will not make such\npayment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in\nreliance upon such assumption, distribute to such Credit Parties the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such\npayment, then each such Credit Party severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to\nsuch Credit Party with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of\npayment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in\naccordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.\n(e) If any Credit Party shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.4(b) or 2.10(d),\nthen the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter\nreceived by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Credit Party to satisfy such Credit Party’s obligations under such Sections until\nall such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to,\nany future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the\nAdministrative Agent in its discretion. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.10 to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a\nDefaulting Lender, then the provisions of Section 2.11 shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender.\nSection 2.11.Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a\nDefaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:\n(a) Fees pursuant to Section 3.3(a) shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting\nLender.\n(b) If any LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:\n(i) All or any part of such LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance\nwith their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Credit\nExposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-\n766170599 11074672    37     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\nDefaulting Lenders’ Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied at such time;\n(ii) If the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall\nwithin two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s LC\nExposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set\nforth in Section 2.9(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;\n(iii) If the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to this\nSection 2.11(b), the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(b) with\nrespect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash\ncollateralized;\n(iv) If the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.11(b), then the\nfees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting\nLenders’ Applicable Percentages;\n(v) If any Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this\nSection 2.11(b), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Banks or any Lender hereunder, all letter of\ncredit fees payable under Section 3.3(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to the\napplicable Issuing Banks until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and\n(vi) If and so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or\nincrease any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the\nnon-Defaulting Lenders or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with this Section 2.11(b), and\nparticipating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting\nLenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.11(b)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).\n(c) The Commitments and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all\nLenders or the Required Lenders have voted or taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment,\nmodification or waiver pursuant to Section 10.2); provided that (i) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all\nLenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of\nsuch Defaulting Lender and (ii) any amendment or modification that increases, or extends the maturity of, such Defaulting Lender’s\nCommitment or reduces the principal amount of, or rate of interest on, any Loan made by such Defaulting Lender, shall require the consent\nof such Defaulting Lender.\n(d) In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Issuing Bank agree that a Defaulting Lender has\nadequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted\nto reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Commitments and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other\nLenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its\nApplicable Percentage, and all cash collateral and accrued interest thereon held by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Banks\nshall be returned to the Borrower forthwith.\n766170599 11074672    38     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\nArticle 3.\n \nINTEREST, FEES, YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.\nSection 3.1.

The Loans comprising each Term Benchmark Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for the Interest Period\nin effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan, any reimbursement obligation in respect\nof any LC Disbursement or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity,\nupon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in\nthe case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraph of this\nSection or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Borrowings as provided in the preceding paragraph of this\nSection.\n(c) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, provided\nthat (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or\nprepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or\nprepayment, and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,\naccrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.\n(d) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by\nreference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a\nyear of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day\nbut excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate shall be\ndetermined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error. The Administrative\nAgent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each change in the Prime\nRate or ABR, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the\namounts and on the dates required.\nSection 3.2.

The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected\nBorrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and\nthe Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.\n(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a signed\nInterest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent by the time that a Credit Request would be required under Section\n2.3 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.\n766170599 11074672    39     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\n(c) Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable (except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4) and shall\nspecify the following information:\n(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected\nwith respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the\ninformation to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified for each resulting\nBorrowing);\n(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business\nDay;\n(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Borrowing; and\n(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after\ngiving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.\nIf any such Interest Election Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall\nbe deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.\n(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the\ndetails thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.\n(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable\nthereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be converted to an\nABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the\nAdministrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing, (i)\nno outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Term Benchmark Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Term Benchmark\nBorrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.\nSection 3.3.

Alternate Rate of Interest.\n(a) Subject to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Section 3.4, if:\n(i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) prior\nto the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not\nexist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Term SOFR Rate, as applicable (including, because the Term\nSOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis) for such Interest Period; or\n(ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that prior to the commencement of any Interest\nPeriod for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and\nfairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or Loan) included in such\nBorrowing for such Interest Period;\nthen the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy, electronic mail or other\nelectronic system as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the\ncircumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest\nElection Request in accordance with the terms of Section 3.2 or a new Credit Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.3, (1) any\nInterest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark\nBorrowing and any Credit Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing shall instead be deemed to be an\n766170599 11074672    41     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\nInterest Election Request or a Credit Request, as applicable, for an ABR Borrowing. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan is\noutstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Section 3.4(a) with respect to\nsuch Term Benchmark Loan, then until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise\nto such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in\naccordance with the terms of Section 3.2 or a new Credit Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.3, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan\nshall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day),\nbe converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event\nand its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current\nBenchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement”\nfor such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under\nany Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action\nor consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in\naccordance with clause (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark\nReplacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at\nor after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any\namendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative\nAgent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required\nLenders.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent will have\nthe right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in\nany other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective\nwithout any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.\n(d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any occurrence of a Benchmark\nTransition Event, the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming\nChanges, the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (e) below and the commencement or conclusion of\nany Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if\napplicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.4, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or\nadjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any\naction or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without\nconsent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this\nSection 3.4.\n(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in\nconnection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term\nSOFR Rate) and either any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from\ntime to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such\nBenchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no\nlonger representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after\nsuch time to remove such unavailable or non-representative\n766170599 11074672    42     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\ntenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a\nBenchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be\nrepresentative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest\nPeriod” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.\n(f) Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower\nmay revoke any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made,\nconverted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any\nrequest for a Term Benchmark Borrowing into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to an ABR Borrowing. During any Benchmark\nUnavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based\nupon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR.\nFurthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a\nBenchmark Unavailability Period, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement is implemented pursuant to this Section 3.4, (1) any\nTerm Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is\nnot a Business Day), be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan.\nSection 3.5.

For purposes of this paragraph, a notice to the Borrower by any Lender shall be\neffective as to each Term Benchmark Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such\nTerm Benchmark Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.\nSection 3.6. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment or prepayment (voluntary or otherwise) of any principal of\nany Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default),\n(b) the conversion\n766170599 11074672    44     ALLETE CREDIT AGREEMENT\nof any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue\nor prepay any Term Benchmark Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be\nrevoked under Section 2.7(c) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the\nlast day of the Interest Period or maturity date applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.8, then, in any\nsuch event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.

If any applicable law\n(as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any\nsuch payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and\nshall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such\nTax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding\nhas been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable\nRecipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.\n(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to\nthe Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a\nLender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.\n(e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days\nafter demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already\nindemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any\nTaxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.4(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant\nRegister and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in\nconnection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were\ncorrectly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

Form and T iming of Payment.  Subject to the provisions hereof (including the provisions of Section 4 governing the\nconversion of the Grant into a Converted Cash Grant (as defined below)), each RSU will be paid in the form of one share of\nALLETE common stock (each, a “Share”), plus accrued Dividend Equivalents. Shares will be deposited into your ALLETE\nInvest Direct plan account. Except as otherwise provided in sections 3, 4, or 5 below , payment will be made during the period\nending sixty days after the end of the vesting period; provided, however , the Participant will not be permitted, directly or\nindirectly , to designate the taxable year of the distribution. Payment will be subject to withholding for taxes; such withholding\nshall be in the form of Shares with a value equal to the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law; such withholding\nwill be in the form of cash in the case of a Converted Cash Grant.\n2.    Dividend Equivalents . Subject to the provisions of Section 4 below , you will receive Dividend Equivalents in connection\nwith the RSUs granted. Dividend Equivalents will be calculated and credited to you at the time the corresponding dividend is\npaid. Dividend Equivalents will be in the form of additional RSUs, which will be added to the number of RSUs subject to the\ngrant, and will equal the number of Shares (including fractional Shares) that could have been purchased on applicable dividend\npayment dates, based on the closing ALLETE common stock price as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system\non that date, with cash dividends that would have been paid on the underlying RSUs, if such RSUs were Shares. Dividend\nEquivalents will only become payable if and to the extent the corresponding RSUs (or Converted Cash Grant) vest and become\npayable. No Dividend Equivalents will be credited following the Mer ger.\n3.    Payment Upon Retirement, Death or Disability; Payment Upon Involuntary Separation Following Mer ger; Forfeiture Upon\nOther T ermination of Employment, Default on Certain Agreements or Unsatisfactory Job Performance .\n3.1    Subject to Section 3.5 below , if during the vesting period you (i) Retire, (ii) die while employed by a Related\nCompany , or (iii) become Disabled, a portion of the unvested RSUs subject to the Grant, or , if applicable a portion of the\nConverted Cash Grant , will vest and be paid to you (or your beneficiary or estate) during the period ending forty-five days\nafter such event; provided, however , you will not be permitted, directly or indirectly , to designate the taxable year of the\ndistribution. Except as otherwise provided in Section or 5 below , payment pursuant to this Section 3.1 will be prorated,\nafter giving ef fect to accumulated Dividend Equivalents, based on the number of whole\n    \nExhibit 10(h)15\ncalendar months within the vesting period that had elapsed as of the date of Retirement, death or Disability in relation to\nthe number of calendar months in the vesting period. For purposes of this calculation, you will be credited with a whole\nmonth if you were employed on the 15  of the month.\n3.2     If you have an Involuntary Separation within 12 months following the Mer ger Ef fective T ime that occurs prior to\npayment of any portion of a Converted Cash Grant, you will be entitled to receive payment of the entire unpaid portion of\nsuch Converted Cash Grant in accordance with Section 1 above.

The payment to which a Specified Employee would otherwise be entitled during\nthis six-month period shall be paid, together with any Dividend Equivalents that have accrued during this six-month\ndelay , if applicable, during the seventh month following the date of the Participant’ s Retirement, or , if earlier , the date of\nthe Participant’ s death.\n4.    Effect of Mer ger. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Grant, any Annex thereto, or provisions in the Plan for Change\nin Control to the contrary , upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Mer ger Agreement, the following terms\nshall apply to the Grant to the extent it is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Mer ger Ef fective T ime:th\n    3\nExhibit 10(h)15\n4.1    The Grant will be canceled as of the Mer ger Ef fective T ime and converted into a contingent right to receive a\nconverted cash award in an aggregate amount, without interest, equal to the value (a) to the number of shares of Company\ncommon stock underlying the Grant immediately prior to the Mer ger Ef fective T ime, after giving ef fect to the\naccumulation of dividend equivalents credited as of the Mer ger Ef fective T ime, multiplied by  (b) $67.00, (the “Converted\nCash Grant”).\n4.2    Any Converted Cash Grant will continue to have, and payment will be subject to, the same terms and conditions as\nthe original Grant, including vesting conditions.\nFor purposes of clarification of this Section 4, the occurrence of the Mer ger contemplated by the Mer ger Agreement will\nexpressly be governed by this Section 4 and not by the provisions of Section 5 below or the provisions in the Plan for Change in\nControl.\n5.    Change in Control . This Section 5 shall not apply to the consummation of the Mer ger. Upon a Change in Control (other than\npursuant to the Mer ger), unless the Committee provides otherwise prior to the Change in Control, outstanding unvested RSUs\nshall be prorated (as described below) and such prorated RSUs shall immediately vest and be payable to you during the period\nending sixty days after the Change in Control. The RSUs will not be subject to proration and immediately vest, however , if and to\nthe extent that the Grant is, in connection with the Change in Control, fully assumed by the successor corporation or parent\nthereof; in such case, the RSUs shall be prorated and immediately vest upon your termination of employment by the successor\ncorporation for reasons other than cause within 18 months following the Change in Control and be payable to the Participant\nduring the period ending sixty days after the termination of employment. Any payment on account of or in connection with a\nChange in Control will be prorated, after giving ef fect to the accumulation of Dividend Equivalents, based on the number of\nwhole calendar months within the vesting period that had elapsed as of the date of the Change in Control or termination of\nemployment, as applicable, in relation to the number of calendar months in the vesting period. For purposes of this calculation,\nyou will be credited with a whole month if you were employed on the 15  of the month. In no event will you be permitted,\ndirectly or indirectly , to designate the taxable year of the distribution on account of or in connection with a Change in Control.\n6.    Compensation Recovery Policy . The Grant is subject to the terms of any compensation recovery policy or policies\nestablished by ALLETE as may be amended from time to time (“Compensation Recovery Policy”). ALLETE hereby\nincorporates into the Grant the terms of the Compensation Recovery Policy .\n7.     Section 409A Compliance.

If ALLETE’ s TSR ranking is at the 50  percentile among the peer group (tar get performance), 100% of the weighted\nPerformance Share Grant will be earned.

This policy applies to all Covered Persons, as well as to: (i) the Covered Person’s family and household members,\nwhich includes family members who reside with a Covered Person (including a spouse, a child, a child away at college, stepchildren,\ngrandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, siblings, and in-laws), anyone else who lives in the Covered Person’s household\n(whether or not they are the Covered Person’s family members), and any family members who do not live in the Covered Person’s\nhousehold, but whose transac\u0000ons in ALLETE securi\u0000es are directed, inﬂuenced, or controlled by the Covered Person (collec\u0000vely,\n“Family Members”) and (ii) any en\u0000\u0000es or persons who are controlled by a Covered Person (“Related En\u0000\u0000es”). ALLETE may also,\nfrom \u0000me to \u0000me, determine that other persons should be subject to this Policy.\nNo Covered Person shall buy or sell securi\u0000es of ALLETE, Inc. (“ALLETE Securi\u0000es”), or otherwise engage in transac\u0000ons in ALLETE\nSecuri\u0000es, including bona ﬁde gi\u0000s or dona\u0000ons of ALLETE Securi\u0000es, on the basis of material non-public informa\u0000on about the\nCompany or ALLETE Securi\u0000es, either directly or through a third party, nor pass on (“\u0000p”) such informa\u0000on to others.\nThis policy also prohibits Covered Persons from buying or selling securi\u0000es of other companies with which the Company does\nbusiness, such as the Company’s customers, suppliers, compe\u0000tors, or joint-venture partners, or companies involved in a poten\u0000al\ntransac\u0000on or business rela\u0000onship with the Company (collec\u0000vely, “Other Companies”) based on material non-public informa\u0000on\nrela\u0000ng to those Other Companies and from \u0000pping such material non-public informa\u0000on to others.\n \nCovered Persons are individually responsible for complying with this policy and for ensuring that any Family Members or Related\nEn\u0000\u0000es also comply with this policy.\nGeneral Requirements\nBoth federal and state securi\u0000es laws and regula\u0000ons prohibit the use of material non-public informa\u0000on when trading in or\nrecommending ALLETE Securi\u0000es. Informa\u0000on is “material” if (i) a reasonable investor would likely consider such informa\u0000on important\nin deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a company’s securi\u0000es or (ii) the informa\u0000on could aﬀect the market or price of a company’s\nsecuri\u0000es, whether it is posi\u0000ve or nega\u0000ve. Common examples of informa\u0000on that could be material include, but are not limited to:\n \n•Financial results or a change in dividends;\n•Projec\u0000ons of future earnings or losses, or other earnings guidance;\n•Earnings that are inconsistent with the consensus expecta\u0000on of the investment community, or a change to previously\nannounced earnings, revenue or other material ﬁnancial projec\u0000ons or guidance;\n•Industry informa\u0000on (such as prices, volumes, or other condi\u0000ons aﬀec\u0000ng the Company’s business or likely to aﬀect other\ncompanies in the industry);\n•Signiﬁcant changes in sales volumes, margins, or pricing;\nExhibit 19\n \n•Signiﬁcant changes in accoun\u0000ng treatment, write-oﬀs, or eﬀec\u0000ve tax rate;\n•A pending or proposed merger, acquisi\u0000on, or disposi\u0000on of a signiﬁcant asset, including the disposi\u0000on of a subsidiary, or\ntender oﬀer;\n•Signiﬁcant changes in senior management;\n•A signiﬁcant change in the ownership of the Company, including a change in control;\n•A signiﬁcant change in capital investment plans;\n•A stock split or new securi\u0000es oﬀering (i.e., pending public or private sales of debt or equity securi\u0000es);\n•An impending bankruptcy ﬁling, an impending insolvency ac\u0000on, or the existence of severe liquidity problems;\n•The gain or loss of a signiﬁcant customer or supplier;\n•A signiﬁcant cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach, or any other incident leading to a signiﬁcant disrup\u0000on in the\nCompany’s opera\u0000ons;\n•Material developments in regulatory or li\u0000ga\u0000on ma\u0000ers, whether actual, pending, or threatened; and\n•Imposi\u0000on of any event-speciﬁc restric\u0000ons on trading securi\u0000es of the Company or any other company, or the extension or\ntermina\u0000on of any such trading restric\u0000ons.\nThis list is not exhaus\u0000ve. Any informa\u0000on, favorable or unfavorable, that could reasonably be expected to aﬀect the price of a\nsecurity should be considered material. Anyone scru\u0000nizing a Covered Person’s, Family Member’s, or Related En\u0000ty’s transac\u0000ons will\nbe doing so a\u0000er the fact, with the beneﬁt of hindsight; before engaging in any transac\u0000on, Covered Persons, Family Members, and\nRelated En\u0000\u0000es should carefully consider how enforcement authori\u0000es and others might view the transac\u0000on in hindsight. Ques\u0000ons\nconcerning the materiality of par\u0000cular informa\u0000on should be resolved in favor of concluding that it is material. Anyone in possession\nof material non-public informa\u0000on including not only Covered Persons, but also persons outside the Company, such as Family\nMembers, Related En\u0000\u0000es, friends, brokers, or others who may have acquired the inside informa\u0000on directly or through \u0000ps, can be\nan insider.\nFederal securi\u0000es laws and regula\u0000ons generally impose upon persons possessing material non-public informa\u0000on a “disclose or\nabstain” rule. This means that the insider must abstain from trading unless the informa\u0000on has been publicly disclosed and suﬃcient\n\u0000me has elapsed for the informa\u0000on to be “absorbed” by the inves\u0000ng public. Because insiders are not generally able to act on their\nown to disclose material non-public informa\u0000on without viola\u0000ng their ﬁduciary duty of conﬁden\u0000ality to ALLETE Companies and\ncausing ALLETE Companies substan\u0000al harm, the “disclose or abstain” rule should be regarded as imposing an obliga\u0000on not to trade\nin ALLETE Securi\u0000es at any \u0000me when one is in possession of material non-public informa\u0000on.\nFurthermore, all external requests for material and non-public informa\u0000on involving ALLETE Companies must be referred without\ncomment to (i) Public Aﬀairs or (ii) Investor Rela\u0000ons for inquiries by securi\u0000es analysts or investors.\nTo assure that Covered Persons do not violate the legal prohibi\u0000on on “insider trading,” the following speciﬁc procedures have been\nestablished. They should not, however, be viewed as exhaus\u0000ve, and any Covered Person who is in doubt as to whether a proposed\ntransac\u0000on in ALLETE Securi\u0000es would violate this insider trading policy or these procedures should consult with ALLETE Inc.’s Chief\nLegal Oﬃcer before going forward with the transac\u0000on.\nSpeciﬁc Requirements\n \nExhibit 19\n \n1. Covered Persons, Family Members, and Related En\u0000\u0000es shall not engage in any transac\u0000on involving any ALLETE Securi\u0000es at\nany \u0000me when such person is in possession of material non-public informa\u0000on, or prior to the third market day following\npublic disclosure of such informa\u0000on. Securi\u0000es trades executed in compliance with a person’s pre-cleared 10b5-1 plan (see\nparagraph 4 below), even if made at a \u0000me when the person possesses material non-public informa\u0000on, will not cons\u0000tute a\nviola\u0000on of this requirement, so long as the person complies with paragraph 4 below and they did not possess material non-\npublic informa\u0000on at the \u0000me they entered into the 10b5-1 plan.\n2. To help avoid the poten\u0000al for improper transac\u0000ons involving ALLETE Securi\u0000es transac\u0000ons before there has been\nadequate public dissemina\u0000on of ﬁnancial informa\u0000on, directors and oﬃcers of the Company shall refrain from transac\u0000ons\nin ALLETE Securi\u0000es (a) during the period commencing on the ﬁrst day of the 15-day period that ends on the last day of the\nquarter (i.e. commencing on March 17, June 16, September 16 or December 17, as applicable) and ending on the second\nmarket day following the public release of ALLETE Inc.’s earnings for that quarter and (b) during certain event-speciﬁc\nblackout periods.\n3. Directors and oﬃcers of the Company shall not engage in any transac\u0000on involving ALLETE Securi\u0000es without ﬁrst complying\nwith the Company’s “pre-clearance” process. This process applies to all transac\u0000ons, including those that occur outside the\nperiod surrounding earnings informa\u0000on. Prior to engaging in a transac\u0000on involving ALLETE Securi\u0000es, directors and oﬃcers\nof the Company must abide by the pre-clearance requirements established by the Company.\nPre-clearance requirements also apply to transac\u0000ons by Family Members and Related En\u0000\u0000es of the Company’s directors\nand oﬃcers. ALLETE Securi\u0000es trades executed in compliance with a pre-cleared 10b5-1 plan (see paragraph 5 below) will not\nrequire further pre-clearance at the \u0000me each trade is transacted.\n4. SEC Rule 10b5-1 provides an aﬃrma\u0000ve defense from insider trading liability under the federal securi\u0000es laws if trades occur\nunder a pre-arranged trading plan that meets certain requirements. A 10b5-1 plan is a binding contract or wri\u0000en instruc\u0000on\nor plan between the trading person and his or her broker that speciﬁes the amount, price and dates on which securi\u0000es are to\nbe purchased or sold on the person’s behalf (or a wri\u0000en formula by which the amount, price and dates of trades will be\ndetermined). The aﬃrma\u0000ve defense aﬀorded by Rule 10b5-1 will be unavailable if the trading person alters or deviates from\nthe contract, instruc\u0000on, or plan.\nTrades in ALLETE Securi\u0000es that are executed pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 plan are not subject to the prohibi\u0000on on trading\non the basis of material nonpublic informa\u0000on or to restric\u0000ons rela\u0000ng to blackout policies and pre-clearance procedures.\nAll directors and oﬃcers of the Company must obtain approval of any 10b5-1 plan in accordance with the pre-clearance process\ndescribed in Sec\u0000on 4 above in advance of the plan’s adop\u0000on. Any modiﬁca\u0000on or amendment to a 10b5-1 plan must comply\nwith all the requirements associated with adop\u0000ng a 10b5-1 plan, including pre-clearance. All trades made pursuant to a 10b5-\n1 plan must s\u0000ll comply with all other applicable disclosure requirements under federal and state securi\u0000es laws.\n5. Sec\u0000on 16 ﬁlers must advise ALLETE’s Chief Legal Oﬃcer in advance of each transac\u0000on in ALLETE Securi\u0000es so that\nappropriate SEC ﬁlings can \u0000mely be made on the person’s behalf.\nExhibit 19\n \n6. No director or oﬃcer of the Company may engage in any short-swing transac\u0000on (any combina\u0000on of purchase and sale or\nsale and purchase of ALLETE Securi\u0000es within six months of each other) in viola\u0000on of the short-swing proﬁt prohibi\u0000on of\nSec\u0000on 16 of the Securi\u0000es Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n7. No director or oﬃcer of the Company may hold ALLETE Securi\u0000es in a margin account or otherwise enter into any pledge\narrangement that would permit a third party to sell ALLETE Securi\u0000es without the director or oﬃcer’s consent or\nknowledge.\n8.

(NYSE: ALE) today reported 2024 earnings of $3.10 per share on net income of $179.3 million and\noperating revenue of $1.5 billion. Reported results from 2023 were $4.30 per share on net income of $247.1 million and operating revenue of\n$1.9 billion. Results for 2024 reflect approximately 39 cents per share of transaction expenses related to the merger agreement entered into\nMay 5, 2024, with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners. Earnings in 2024 were positively impacted by\nthe implementation of interim rates on January 1, 2024, net of reserves, related to Minnesota Power’s rate case settlement. Net income in\n2023 included approximately 6 cents per share for transaction expenses and 71 cents per share related to the arbitration award at ALLETE\nClean Energy including consolidated income tax impacts recorded at Corporate and Other. Earnings per share dilution in 2024 was two cents\ndue to additional shares of common stock outstanding in 2024.\n“I am pleased and extremely proud of our entire ALLETE team this past year, working diligently on many fronts to execute our\nSustainability in Action strategy in tandem with initiatives as part of the merger agreement with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and\nGlobal Infrastructure Partners,” said ALLETE Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer Bethany Owen. “The merger continues to\nprogress as planned, and we remain on track for a 2025 closing, subject to all necessary approvals. With the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission approval in December, we met another important milestone that brings us closer to realizing the benefits of this transaction for\nour customers, our communities, our co-workers, and our shareholders, and we held the first of multiple public hearings in January.”\nOwen continued, “At Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light & Power, our teams continue to execute on our commitments to provide\nsafe, resilient, reliable, and affordable service to our customers. We were pleased that the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved\nMinnesota Power’s 2023 rate case settlement agreement in the fourth quarter, with final rates expected to be implemented in the first quarter\nof 2025. In addition, Superior Water, Light & Power implemented new rates on January 1, 2025, and our New Energy Equity team continues\nto execute on its strategy and robust pipeline of projects.”\n“Overall results for 2024 were slightly above expectations excluding transaction expenses and interim rate refund reserves resulting from the\nMinnesota Power rate case settlement,” said ALLETE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Steve Morris. “While earnings were\nlower at ALLETE Clean Energy, primarily due to a longer than expected forced outage near its Caddo wind energy, earnings from the\nAmerican Transmission Company and New Energy Equity slightly exceeded expectations.”\nPage 1 of 5\nALLETE · 30 W est Superior Street, Duluth, Minnesota 55802\nALLETE’s Regulated Operations segment, which includes Minnesota Power, Superior Water, Light & Power and the Company’s investment\nin the American Transmission Company (“ATC”), recorded 2024 net income of $160.9 million, compared to $147.2 million in 2023. Net\nincome at Minnesota Power was higher compared to 2023 reflecting the implementation of interim rates on January 1, 2024, net of reserves\nrelated to Minnesota Power’s rate case settlement. Also included in 2024 were higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher\ndepreciation and property tax expenses, as well as lower margins from industrial customers. Earnings at Superior Water, Light & Power were\nlower in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses. Our after-tax equity earnings at ATC were\nhigher than 2023 reflecting period over period changes in ATC’s estimate of a refund liability related to a FERC decision on MISO return on\nequity complaints in 2024.\nALLETE Clean Energy recorded 2024 net income of $17.8 million compared to $71.7 million in 2023. Net income in 2024 reflected impacts\nfrom a forced network outage near its Caddo wind energy facility as well as a transformer outage at its Diamond Springs wind energy facility\nduring the first half of the year. These decreases were partially offset by a $3.5 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Whitetail wind project\nand lower operating and maintenance expenses. Net income in 2023 included a $44.3 million, after-tax gain recognized for the favorable\narbitration award, as well as the gain on sale of the Red Barn project and higher interest income related to interest awarded as part of the\narbitration ruling.\nCorporate and Other businesses, which include New Energy Equity, BNI Energy, ALLETE Properties and our investments in renewable\nenergy facilities, recorded net income of $0.6 million in 2024, compared to net income of $28.2 million in 2023. Net income in 2024\nincluded higher transaction expenses of approximately 33 cents per share, related to the merger agreement entered into in May of 2024, as\nwell as lower earnings from Minnesota solar projects as investment tax credits were recognized in 2023, and lower earnings at ALLETE\nProperties due to higher land sales in 2023. These were partially offset by higher earnings at New Energy Equity in 2024 compared to 2023.\nALLETE is an energy company headquartered in Duluth, Minn. In addition to its electric utilities, Minnesota Power and Superior Water,\nLight & Power of Wisconsin, ALLETE owns ALLETE Clean Energy, based in Duluth, BNI Energy in Bismarck, N.D., New Energy Equity\nin Annapolis, MD, and has an eight percent equity interest in the American Transmission Co.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements\ninvolve risks and uncertainties and investors are directed to the risks discussed in documents filed by ALLETE with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\nALLETE's press releases and other communications may include certain non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures. A\n\"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or\nincludes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the\ncompany's financial statements.\nPage 2 of 5\nALLETE 30 W est Superior Street, Duluth, Minnesota 55802\nNon-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings (loss) per share. ALLETE's management believes that these non-\nGAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not\nindicative of changes in the fundamental earnings power of the Company's operations. Management believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures is appropriate and enables investors and analysts to more accurately compare the company's ongoing financial performance over the\nperiods presented.\nPage 3 of 5\nALLETE 30 W est Superior Street, Duluth, Minnesota 55802\nALLETE, Inc.\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nFor the Periods Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\nQuarter Ended Year to Date\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nMillions Except Per Share Amounts\nOperating Revenue\nContracts with Customers – Utility $314.1 $319.2 $1,242.7 $1,238.3 \nContracts with Customers – Non-utility 49.5 82.3 282.1 636.4 \nOther – Non-utility 1.2 1.2 5.0 5.1 \nTotal Operating Revenue 364.8 402.7 1,529.8 1,879.8 \nOperating Expenses\nFuel, Purchased Power and Gas – Utility 120.3 132.1 477.6 482.9 \nTransmission Services – Utility 20.7 21.9 64.6 88.2 \nCost of Sales – Non-utility 26.0 36.8 129.2 473.5 \nOperating and Maintenance 74.9 91.1 361.4 345.3 \nDepreciation and Amortization 69.7 63.6 271.5 251.8 \nTaxes Other than Income Taxes 15.1 14.1 65.4 57.2 \nTotal Operating Expenses 326.7 359.6 1,369.7 1,698.9 \nOperating Income 38.1 43.1 160.1 180.9 \nOther Income (Expense)     \nInterest Expense (20.9) (19.9) (81.7) (80.8)\nEquity Earnings 8.5 5.6 25.0 21.7 \nOther 3.0 9.7 23.0 85.0 \nTotal Other Income (Expense) (9.4) (4.6) (33.7) 25.9 \nIncome Before Non-Controlling Interest and Income Taxes 28.7 38.5 126.4 206.8 \nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit) (3.6) 7.5 4.7 27.9 \nNet Income 32.3 31.0 121.7 178.9 \nNet Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest (18.3) (20.5) (57.6) (68.2)\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE $50.6 $51.5 $179.3 $247.1 \nAverage Shares of Common Stock\nBasic 57.8 57.5 57.7 57.3\nDiluted 58.0 57.6 57.8 57.4\nBasic Earnings Per Share of Common Stock $0.88 $0.89 $3.11 $4.31\nDiluted Earnings Per Share of Common Stock $0.87 $0.89 $3.10 $4.30\nDividends Per Share of Common Stock $0.71 $0.68 $2.82 $2.71\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nMillions\nDec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAssets Liabilities and Equity\nCash and Cash Equivalents $32.8 $71.9Current Liabilities $404.2 $377.6\nOther Current Assets 402.4 396.2Long-Term Debt 1,704.7 1,679.9\nProperty, Plant and Equipment – Net 5,181.5 5,013.4Deferred Income Taxes 253.4 192.7\nRegulatory Assets 371.7 425.4Regulatory Liabilities 570.5 574.0\nEquity Investments 340.1 331.2Defined Benefit Pension & Other Postretirement\nBenefit Plans118.2 160.8\nGoodwill and Intangibles – Net 155.3 155.4Other Non-Current Liabilities 312.8 264.3\nOther Non-Current Assets 270.5 262.9Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest 0.4 0.5 \nEquity 3,390.1 3,406.6\nTotal Assets $6,754.3 $6,656.4Total Liabilities and Equity $6,754.3 $6,656.4\nPage 4 of 5\nALLETE 30 W est Superior Street, Duluth, Minnesota 55802\nQuarter Ended Year to Date\nALLETE, Inc.

I feel that GIP and Blackrock will be increasing rates once the sale  is complete. Will GIP/Blackrock aimto reach our state standards of decarbonation? What is their reputation?  I feel that most of us retired people willhave to leave our homes because of these higher rates. We are on fixed incomes.  The  PUC has helped us before,will you please take a good look into the sale? Thank you so much.\nBonnie Frielund\nbjfrielund@gmail.comSent from my iPhone"

McKenzie \nAdministrative Law Judge \nOffice of Administrative Hearings \n600 North Robert Street \nSt. Paul, MN 55164-0620 \n \nRe:  In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada \nPension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners \nOAH Docket No. 25-2500-40339 \nMPUC Docket No. E-015/PA-24-198 \n \nLetter Brief re: Sequestration of Witnesses \n \nDear Judge McKenzie: \n \nDuring the March 28, 2025 prehearing conference in this matter, counsel for the Department of \nCommerce (“Department”) requested that witnesses should be sequestered during the upcoming \nhearing in this matter. Counsel presented two bases for its request: (a) witness sequestration was \nused in a recent OAH contested case proceeding known as the Sherco Outage Case1; and (b) they \nparticularly wanted certain witnesses (presumably GIP witness Jonathan Bram and CPP \nInvestments witness Andrew Alley) to be sequestered so that the Department could “test” whether \nthe Petitioners were aligned. The Department acknowledged, though, that sequestration should not \napply to witnesses who are party representatives.  \n \nThe Department’s arguments are illogical and unfounded. First, it would be a severe due process \nviolation to sequester Mr. Bram, Mr. Alley, or other party representatives from the hearing. \nSecond, witness sequestration was not used in the Sherco Outage case. Third, sequestration would \nbe highly atypical for Minnesota Public Utilities Proceedings and inconsistent with the nature of \nthese proceedings (which are public except for confidential data, and which are premised on pre-\nfiled testimony rather than direct testimony provided for the first time at the evidentiary hearing.  \nFourth, the Department has acknowledged the complex technical nature of this proceeding, which \nrequires assistance from party witnesses to develop arguments, cross-examination, and briefing.  \nThe Department’s request should be denied—there is no reason why any of the witnesses in this \nproceeding should be sequestered. \n \n \n1 See In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Co. for Authority to Increase Rates for \nElectric Service in the State of Minnesota et al , OAH No. 65-2500-38476, MPUC Docket No. E-002/GR-\n12-961 et al, F INDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND RECOMMENDATION  (May 14, 2024) (the \n“Sherco Outage Case”).   \n172063002v7 \n 2 \n A. Overview of Sequestration Principles \nThe rule that directly governs sequestration in OAH proceedings is Minn. R. 1400.7200. The \nrelevant passage of that rule is: \n \nAt the request of a party or upon the judge’s own motion, the judge shall exclude \nwitnesses from the hearing room so that they cannot hear the testimony of other \nwitnesses. \n \nRule 1400.7200 was adopted decades ago in connection with the development of the Minnesota \nHuman Rights Act, with the Minnesota Human Rights Act serving as the only stated basis for the \nadoption of the Rule.2 It would be reasonable for sequestration to be used in such cases, so that \nwitnesses feel safe, and because such cases involve investigations of wrongdoing, parallel in nature \nto a criminal proceeding.  This is a very different proceeding. \n \nMore generally, application of Rule 1400.7200 is within the ALJ’s discretion: \n \n[O]rdering sequestration is within the discretion of a trial court judge and is less \ncommon in civil than criminal trials. Consequently, no sound reason exists for \ndenying an administrative law judge the same discretion, especially in light of the \nincreased informality of administrative proceedings.3  \n \nThe purpose of witness sequestration has been explained by the U.S. Supreme Court: “The aim of \n[sequestration] is two-fold. It exercises a restraint on witnesses ‘tailoring’ their testimony to that \nof earlier witnesses; and it aids in detecting testimony that is less than candid.”4  \n \nA treatise addressing Rule 1400.7200 states that when sequestration is being considered, the \n“limitations imposed should be the least restrictive necessary.”5 \n \n1. Sequestration Is Not Typical In Utilities Cases \nIn the long experience of ALLETE’s and the Partners’ counsel, who have served as utility \ncounsel, Commissioners on the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, and as legal counsel of \nthe Commission, witness sequestration is virtually never used in public utilities contested cases at \nOAH. There are several reasons for this.   \n \nFirst, witness testimony in utility evidentiary hearings is limited to cross-examination and \nredirect; virtually all other testimony is pre-filed and submitted into the record.  This is due in large \n \n2 The statutory authority for Rule 1400.7200 includes only one substantive statute, Minn. Stat. § 363A.28 \n(relating to violations of the Minnesota Human Rights Act).  \n3 Keppel, 21 Minn. Prac., Administrative Prac. & Proc., § 9.35 (2d ed., October 2023 Update). \n4 Geders v. U.S ., 425 U.S. 80, 87 (1976). \n5 Minnesota Administrative Procedure, available at https://mitchellhamline.edu/minnesota-administrative-\nprocedure, Chapter 11 (“The Contested Case Hearing”), footnote 37 (citing Pechter v. Lyons , 441 F.Supp. \n115, 119-20 (S.D.N.Y. 1977)).  \n172063002v7 \n 3 \n part to the highly technical nature of utility proceedings, which also underscore the need for \nwitnesses to hear each other to assist in the presentation of the case.  The Department’s own \ncomments in this proceeding have stated that “aspects of the proposed Acquisition, particularly \nthe nature of ALLETE’s potential acquirers and the complex legal structure ALLETE will be part \nof post-Acquisition, raise novel and highly technical issues of fact and policy.”6 \n \nSecond, the safety and investigative concerns that may be present in MHRA cases are not \npresent in the context of Minnesota Public Utilities Commission proceedings, where transparency \nto the public is strongly encouraged.  \n \nThird, as a general rule, OAH hearings are open to the public (except for trade secret or \nhighly confidential trade secret information).7  The same is true for proceedings before the \nCommission.8 The parties spent considerable time at the March 28, 2025 prehearing conference \ndiscussing how the upcoming hearing is open to the public (except for trade secret and highly \nconfidential trade secret information). Further, the October 28, 2024 prehearing order in this \nproceeding assumes (see ¶ 32) that the hearing is open to the public.  \n \nIndeed, the entire reason why the parties have entered into protective orders, as well as \nengaged in motion practice regarding confidentiality designations, in this case is because otherwise \nthis proceeding is open to the public. This strong presumption toward public access strongly \nmilitates against any procedure—such as an unjustified sequestration request—that would exclude \nanyone from the hearing.  \n \n2. Application of Rule 1400.7200 to Party Representatives Presents Serious \nDue Process Concerns \nWhen considering Rule 1400.7200, the Court should look to the parallel rules from federal and \nstate court relating to sequestration.9 Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides: \n \nAt a party’s request, the court must order witnesses excluded from the courtroom \nso that they cannot hear other witnesses’ testimony….But this rule does not \nauthorize excluding:…(2) one officer or employee of a party that is a natural \n \n6 August 19, 2024 Department Comments. \n7 See Minn. Stat. § 14.60, subd. 1 (allowing the ALJ to close the hearing if non-public information is going \nto be discussed; this implies that otherwise the hearing is public); Minn. R. 1400.7800 (…all contested case \nhearings are open to the public.”). \n8 See Minn. Stat. § 13D.01, subd. 1(a)(3) (Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is subject to Minnesota’s \nOpen Meeting Law); https://mn.gov/puc/get-involved/ (“The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission \nwelcomes and encourages interested members of the public to attend any of our public hearings.”). \n9 Doing so is consistent with the principle that when OAH procedural rules are silent, the Minnesota Rules \nof Evidence can provide guidance. See Minn. R. 1400.6600 (in procedural motion where the OAH \nprocedural rules are silent, the judge shall apply the Rules of Civil Procedure “to the extent it is determined \nappropriate in order to promote a fair and expeditious proceeding); In re Remedial Action Order Issued To \nDean Page , OAH 82-0500-37640 at *2, 2021 WL 5763332 (Nov. 16, 2021) (Barbara J. Case, ALJ) \n(flexibly applying Evidence Rules in OAH matter). \n172063002v7 \n 4 \n person, if that officer or employee has been designated as the party’s representative \nby its attorney; (3) any person whose presence a party shows to be essential to \npresenting the party’s claim or defense… \n \nThe Advisory Committee notes to Fed. R. Evid. 615 explain that “exclusion of persons who are \nparties would raise serious problems of confrontation and due process.”10 This is because “[t]he \nrequirement of due process means opportunity for a hearing, i.e., opportunity to be present during \nthe taking of testimony or evidence.”11 \n \nThe Court should also look to Minn. R. Evid. 615. The Committee Comment to Minn. R. Evid. \n615 says that sequestration should rarely be denied in criminal cases, but: \n \nThe committee agrees, however, with the Advisory Committee Note to Fed. R. \nEvid. 615 that investigating officers, agents who were involved in the transaction \nbeing litigated, or experts essential to advise counsel in the litigation can be \nessential to the trial process and should not be excluded .12 \n \nIn a civil case in Minnesota state court, a party seeking sequestration under Minn. R. Evid. 615 \nmust show that the sequestration was necessary and that the denial of sequestration will result in \nprejudice.13 \n \nThese lessons from Fed. R. Evid. 615 and Minn. R. Evid. 615, as well as the Minnesota Court of \nAppeals decision in Hantu , are exemplified in the only OAH case that ALLETE has found that \nprovides an in-depth discussion of witness sequestration, Moffat v. Hennepin County .14 Moffat \nbrought a case under the Minnesota Human Rights Act alleging that the County failed to provide \na reasonable accommodation for her disability. Before the hearing, she requested that the County’s \nwitnesses be sequestered. In analyzing Moffat’s request, the ALJ recognized that application of \nRule 1400.7200 required discretion and that “Administrative Law Judges have looked to Rule 615 \nof the state and federal Rules of Evidence for guidance in construing sequestration \nrequirements.”15 Noting the party representative exception in Fed. R. Evid. 615, the ALJ concluded \n“Hennepin County is entitled to designate a representative who will be allowed to remain in the \n \n10 Fed. R. Evid. 615, 1972 Proposed Rules Advisory Committee Notes (citing 6 Wigmore § 1841). \n11 Railroad and Warehouse Comm’n of Minnesota v. Chicago and Nw. Ry. Co ., 98 N.W.2d 60, 66 (Minn. \n1959) (emphasis added) (quoting Juster Bros., Inc. v. Christgau , 7 N.W.2d 501, 507 (Minn. 1943).) \n12 Rule 615, Minnesota Rules of Evidence, Committee Comment – 1989 (emphasis added). \n13 See Hantu v. Onan Corp ., 2001 WL 1753587 at *3 (Minn. Ct. App. 2002) (denying Appellant’s claim of \nprocedural error because Appellant did not show “why sequestration was necessary, how the denial of \nsequestration was an abuse of discretion, or that any prejudice resulted from this failure to sequester”). \n14 Moffat v. Hennepin County , OAH 11-1700-9528-2, 1996 WL 907949 (June 1996). All the other OAH \ndecisions that ALLETE has found relating to witness sequestration merely mention in passing, with no \nanalysis, that non-party witnesses were sequestered. \n15 Id. at *3.  \n172063002v7 \n 5 \n courtroom during the hearing.”16 Hennepin County identified Nancy Skilling as its representative. \nMoffat objected on the basis that Ms. Skilling had been involved in the case, and also expressed \nconcern that Ms. Skilling’s testimony would be “tailored” if she remained in the courtroom \nthroughout the trial. The ALJ denied Moffat’s objection, noting “In the Judge's experience, and as \nreflected in applicable case law, it is frequently the case that persons designated as party \nrepresentatives have significant involvement in the case and are nevertheless permitted to remain \nin the courtroom throughout the trial and provide their own testimony in the case.”17 The Moffat  \ncase thus demonstrates that the Court should be mindful of the party representative exception under \nFed. R. Evid. 615 and that party representatives should not be sequestered, even if substantively \ninvolved in the case.  \n \nB. The Department’s Arguments Are Baseless \n1. Party Representatives Cannot Be Sequestered \nThe Department asked for unspecified witnesses (presumably Mr. Alley, Mr. Bram, and maybe \nothers) to be sequestered from each other. But the Department also recognized that it is \ninappropriate to sequester party representatives. The Department’s position makes no sense—\nseveral of the witnesses obviously function as the persons at their respective companies who are \nresponsible for testifying regarding the Acquisition, and they are the persons sent by their \ncompanies to observe and participate in the hearing. Their role is the essence of what a party \nrepresentative is.  \n \nSequestering Mr. Bram, Mr. Alley, or various ALLETE witnesses from the hearing would be a \ndue process violation, prohibiting GIP, CPP Investments, and ALLETE from the opportunity to \nobserve the hearing in which they are the petitioners. Additionally, even if the ALJ were inclined \nto undertake any limited sequestration, Mr. Taran, Mr. Scissons, and Mr. Anderson will provide \ntestimony that is essential to presenting ALLETE’s case. Consistent with the policy set forth in \nFed. R. Evid. 615, none of these witnesses should be sequestered. Under Moffat  and Fed. R. Evid. \n615, Mr. Bram, Mr. Alley, and various ALLETE witnesses must be allowed to be present \nthroughout the hearing, because they are the party representatives of the Partners and ALLETE—\notherwise, the Partners and ALLETE will be denied due process. \n \n2. Based on the Record, it Appears That Sequestration Was Not Used in the \nSherco Outage Case \nThe Department’s reliance on the Sherco Outage case appears unfounded. The Petitioners have \nreviewed the record of that matter and found no indication of witness sequestration. The \nDepartment may have asked in that case for plant witnesses from Xcel Energy to be sequestered \nso that they could not hear each other’s testimony, but the OAH hearing transcript shows that the \nsecond plant witness, Kolb, was present in the hearing room for the testimony of a prior plant \nwitness, Murray: \n \n \n16 Id. \n17 Id. \n172063002v7 \n 6 \n Q.  Good afternoon, sir. We have not met. My name is Greg Merz. I’m one of the \nattorneys representing the Department of Commerce.  \nYou were here and saw me questioning Mr. Murray; correct? \nA. Correct.18 \n \nWhether the Department is aware of facts not included in the record of the Sherco Outage case, or \nthe Department’s comment at the prehearing conference was in error, misrepresented what \noccurred, or was intended to refer to something else entirely is not clear. In any event, the Sherco \nOutage case was similarly a highly technical matter where the record indicates that utility \nwitnesses were not sequestered.   \n \n3. The Partners’ and ALLETE’s Party Representatives Cannot Be Sequestered \nUltimately, the Department’s proposal is clearly targeting the Company and the Partners, who are \nthe petitioners in this matter with the greatest burden, and who have the most witnesses to be \nsequestered if sequestration were ordered. Further, in making this request the Department has \noffered no evidence that any witness is untrustworthy – which would be a frankly insulting and \nunfounded proposition, particularly for the professionals in this matter who are testifying on \nprofessional matters and, in many cases, appear before the OAH and Commission regularly. Such \nprocedural gamesmanship should not be permitted.   \n \nC. Conclusion \nAs this tribunal is already aware, this matter involves many detailed and complex issues. Indeed, \nthe future of safe, reliable, and affordable electric utility service in Northeastern Minnesota, and \nthe ability of ALLETE to work toward Minnesota’s carbon-free standard, ride on this case. It is \nessential for all parties’ witnesses to hear all the other witnesses, so that counsel can rely on those \nwitnesses’ technical knowledge and experience to assist with presenting and briefing the case. \n \nIn light of these high stakes and the complexity of the upcoming hearing, and because it threatens \nto undermine fundamental issues of fairness and due process, the Department’s request is far too \nserious an issue to present in an offhand, unexplained oral request just a few days before the \nhearing. If the Department was serious about this proposal, it should have brought a motion in \nlimine well ahead of time under OAH Procedural Rule 1400.6600.  \n \nMoreover, if the Court determines to allow sequestration as to witnesses (other than party \nrepresentatives), sequestration should apply in the least restrictive manner and even-handedly to \nall parties. Several of the intervenor parties make overlapping arguments against ALLETE and the \nPartners, and have clearly coordinated in the past, including on matters such as the questions they \ncollectively asked the Commission to put to the ALJ. If it would be reasonable to exclude certain \nALLETE or Partners witnesses, it would be just as reasonable to exclude each OAG and DOC \nwitness, so that they do not improperly “tailor” their testimony to each other. \n \n \n18 Sherco Outage Case, Tr. Vol. 1, p. 156, lines 12-17 (excerpt enclosed as Attachment A, for ease of \nreference) (emphasis added). \n172063002v7 \n 7 \n In sum, the Court should not grant the Department’s belated, illogical, and unsupported \nsequestration request. ALLETE and the Partners respectfully urge the Court to reject the \nDepartment’s request for witness sequestration. \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \n \n \nElizabeth M. Brama \nKodi J.

As I discussed, we\n21    evaluated the operational history of the unit;\n22    the fact that we had conducted a magnetic\n23    particle inspection or MPI in 1999; phased array\n24    testing in 2005, with no indications of cracking\n25    or concern; and the fact that the unit had been\nPage 154\n 1    running efficiently, effectively, and with\n 2    minimal downtime.  I also reported this change.\n 3        Moreover, none of the applicable GE\n 4    inspections or technical advice compelled a\n 5    different decision.  Even more, our\n 6    communication with GE and the written advice on\n 7    hand gave no indication that a major overhaul,\n 8    much less an expensive time-consuming blades-off\n 9    inspection would be warranted in 2011.\n10        With all the consideration, the\n11    change to a 9-year interval, meaning the next\n12    major inspection would be in 2014, was\n13    reasonable and prudent.\n14        In my rebuttal testimony, I respond\n15    to the Department's consultant, Mr. Polich, in\n16    particular to certain untrue and insulting\n17    testimony regarding the actions and decisions I\n18    and others at the company took regarding Unit 3,\n19    our showcase unit.\n20        As I reiterated, our decisions and\n21    actions with respect to the maintenance and\n22    inspection of this unit reflected, one, existing\n23    guidance from the original equipment\n24    manufacturer we call the OEM or GE.\n25        Two, general industry practices atPage 155\n 1    the time.\n 2        Three, our own internal experiences\n 3    with Unit 3 and units across our entire fleet.\n 4        Four, careful examination of numerous\n 5    data points that were monitored and evaluated\n 6    by the team dedicated to Unit 3.\n 7        And five, input from our\n 8    designated -- excuse me, GE representatives\n 9    related to overhaul/inspection/planning.\n10        In addition, I explained that prior\n11    to the 2011 failure event, there was no industry\n12    guidance or general industry knowledge that the\n13    Unit 3 turbine rotor wheel finger dovetails were\n14    highly susceptible to stress corrosion cracking\n15    as compared to the emerging issues that were\n16    associated with stress corrosion cracking with\n17    tangential entry dovetails.\n18        In conclusion, we had an experienced\n19    team of plant personnel that carefully monitored\n20    all plant systems and evaluated data and\n21    operations; researched, planned and executed the\n22    maintenance, overhaul/inspections for Unit 3 in\n23    a manner that was consistent with industry\n24    practices and knowledge existing at the time.\n25        That concludes my summary.\nPage 156\n 1        JUDGE O'REILLY: Thank you.

For the reasons set forth below, the OAG’s \nMotion should be denied. However, the Company believes certain portions of the material OAG \nredacted as nonpublic in its own data request can be unredacted, as discussed herein. The Company \nhas worked hard to narrowly tailor the data it seeks to maintain confidential. Overall, the OAG \nand other Parties have ample access to the proprietary data without publicly disclosing it.  \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn December 5, 2024, the Administrative Law Judge issued a Protective Order that \nincorporates the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act’s (“MGDPA”) definition of “trade \nsecret.”1 \n \n1 See Protective Order and Protective Order for Trade Secret Data ¶ 1 (Dec. 5, 2024) (“The ‘protected data’ as used in \nthis Protective Order is defined as: … (2) ‘security information,’ ‘trade secret information,’ or ‘not public data’ within \nthe meaning of Minn. Stat. §§ 13.02, subd. 8a, 13.37, subd. 1(a), (b)”).  \n2 \n Under the MGDPA definition, information must remain nonpublic if: “(1) it is supplied by \nthe affected individual or organization; (2) it is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its \nsecrecy; and (3) it derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily \nascertainable.”2 \nOn December 23, 2024, Sierra Club served Sierra Club Information Request (“IR”) No. 26 \nupon the Company, requesting “the estimated revenue requirement” and the estimated “monthly \nbill impacts for an average residential customer.”3 \nOn January 7, 2025, the Company served its response to Sierra Club IR No. 26. Attached \nto its response to Sierra Club IR No. 26, the Company provided an Excel spreadsheet titled \n“SIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS.xlsx” (“Attachment 26.02 TS”).4 The Company designated the \nspreadsheet as trade secret in its entirety.5 The Company provided the following justification for \ndesignating the information within Attachment 26.02 TS as trade secret: \nSIERRA CLUB IR 0026.02 Attach TS includes trade secret information as defined \nby Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b). This information derives independent economic \nvalue, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily \nascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain value from its \ndisclosure or use. Thus, the Company has made reasonable efforts to maintain its \nsecrecy. Because the Company has classified the entire document as trade secret \ninformation, the Company provides the following description of the excised \nmaterial as required by Minn. R. 7829.0500, subp. 3: []6 \nOne week later, on January 16, 2025, the OAG sent the Company OAG IR No. 42 asking \nquestions regarding Attachment 26.02 TS.7 In issuing OAG IR No 42, the OAG made most of the \n \n2 Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b).  \n3 Taran Decl. ¶ 3. \n4 Taran Decl. ¶ 4; Brama Decl. ¶ 3. \n5 Taran Decl. ¶ 4 Brama Decl. ¶ 3. \n6 Brama Decl. ¶ 4 (Minn.

Thus, this information is trade secret \ninformation as defined by Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b).13 \nIn providing its overall response, the Company reiterated that it was not anticipating any \nparticular rate change over the specified time period.14 Rather, Attachment 26.02 TS was a high-\nlevel modeling exercise of potential revenue requirements based on a set of assumptions at a point \nin time.15 The actual level of required revenue would change based on a multitude of factors over \nthis time period, including potential future decisions of the Commission in cost recovery \n \n8 Brama Decl. ¶ 6. \n9 Taran Decl. ¶ 6; Brama Decl. ¶ 7. \n10 Brama Decl. ¶ 7.  \n11 Brama Decl. ¶ 8. \n12 Id.  \n13 Brama Decl. ¶ 9. \n14 Taran Decl. ¶ 7. \n15 Taran Decl. ¶ 8. \n4 \n proceedings, on which the Company cannot speculate.16 However, the model reflects the \nCompany’s proprietary model and modeling outcomes. These facts limit the relevance of the \ninformation for this proceeding, while at the same time underscoring that the information, if made \npublic, could be taken out of context, and misused as discussed in more detail below. \nWaiting until more than two months after the Company served its response to Sierra Club \nIR 26 and roughly two weeks before the evidentiary hearing, the OAG served a letter on the \nCompany by email and U.S. Mail (received the following week) during the afternoon of Thursday, \nMarch 13, 2025 that requested that the Company voluntarily remove trade-secret designations \nfrom SIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS and from its response to OAG IR No. 42 and requesting to \nmeet and confer regarding the OAG’s request.17 The OAG did not state a deadline for its \nconferral.18 Both counsel appearing for the Company were traveling March 13-14, 2025.19 \nOn Monday, March 17, counsel for the OAG threatened to file a motion if the Company \ndid not respond that day.20 The Company proposed a time to confer, and met with the OAG that \nsame day.21 During the conferral, the OAG stated it might withhold its motion if the Company \nagreed to a partial resolution.22 After the conferral the OAG sent an email identifying extensive \nunredactions to which the Company needed to agree to that afternoon, or else the OAG would file \nits motion.23 In light of the confidentiality of the underlying model and data, as well as the time \nprovided and in light of the OAG’s unreasonable demands, the parties did not come to a \nresolution.24 \n \n16 Id. \n17 Brama Decl. ¶ 10. \n18 Id.  \n19 Brama Decl. ¶ 11. \n20 Brama Decl. ¶ 12. \n21 Id. \n22 Id. \n23 Id.  \n24 Id.  \n5 \n The OAG served its Notice and Motion to Lift Trade Secret Designations that same day.25 \nThe Company is therefore compelled to respond in the last two weeks before the evidentiary \nhearing and overlapping with receipt of all parties’ extensive Surrebuttal less than a week before \nthe evidentiary hearing. \nTRADE SECRET DESIGNATIONS  \nI. Classification of Trade Secrets Under the MGDPA \nUnder the MGDPA, all data held by a government entity are presumed public “unless \nclassified by statute . . . as nonpublic or protected nonpublic.”26 “Trade secret information” is \nstatutorily defined as “government data including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, \ndevice, method, technique or process (1) that was supplied by the affected individual or \norganization, (2) that is the subject of efforts by the individual or organization that are reasonable \nunder the circumstances to maintain its secrecy, and (3) that derives independent economic value, \nactual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by \nproper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.”27  \nFurther, Minnesota Rules governing protected data in Minnesota Public Utilities \nCommission matters only require an “accompanying statement justifying the state agencies \ntreating the data as protected data,” including “an explanation of how the data is classified under \nthe [MGDPA] or is privileged under a rule of privilege recognized by law.”28 Certain specific \nadditional information is required where the data is nonpublic in its entirety.29 Importantly, \n \n25 See Office of the Attorney General—Residential Utilities Division’s Notice of Motion and Motion to Lift Trade \nSecret Designation (“OAG Motion”) (March 17, 2025) (eDocket No. 20253-216485-02 ). \n26 Minn. Stat. § 13.03, subd. 1. \n27 Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd 1(b).  \n28 Minn. R. 7829.0500, Subp. 5. \n29 Minn. R. 7829.0500, Subps. 3 and 5.  \n6 \n “[n]othing in [Minn. R. 7829] requires public disclosure of protected data or any disclosure of \nprivileged data.”30  \nOAG does not dispute that the Company provided explanations as required by Minnesota \nRules, nor that the Company meets the first two criteria of the definition of “trade secret \ninformation.” Rather, the OAG disputes whether Attachment 26.02 TS “derives independent \neconomic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily \nascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure \nor use.”31 As shown below, the redacted data in Attachment 26.02 TS and the Company’s response \nto OAG IR No. 42 are protected and privileged data of the Company.  \nARGUMENT  \nI. Standard of Review \nThe OAG’s Motion is effectively a motion to compel the Company to produce publicly its \nproprietary model and modeling data. Minnesota Rules governing administrative proceedings \nbefore the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) provide that in a motion to compel \nproduction of a document, “the party seeking discovery shall have the burden of showing that the \ndiscovery is needed for the proper presentation of the party's cases, is not for purposes of delay, \nand that the issues or amounts in controversy are significant enough to warrant the discovery. In \nruling on a discovery motion, the judge shall recognize all privileges recognized at law.”32 As \nsuch, at a minimum the OAG should have the burden to prove the nonpublic data must be made \n \n30 Minn. R. 7829.0500, Subp. 1. \n31 OAG Motion at 4; Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd 1(b). \n32 Minn. R. 1400.6700, Subp. 2. Even if the OAG's motion is not treated as a motion to compel, the OAG's position \nthat Minnesota Power is not entitled to protect information that would create a competitive advantage if known to \nothers – whether to customers, investors, other utilities, or future rate case intervenors - and that Minnesota Power has \ngone to great lengths to maintain as trade secret, is not supported by the rules and standard practice in Commission \nmatters. \n7 \n public in order for “the proper presentation of [its] case” and that the motion is not for purposes of \ndelay.  \nFurther, “[w]hen a party is asked to reveal material considered to be proprietary \ninformation or trade secrets, or not public data, that party may bring the matter to the attention of \nthe judge, who shall make such protective orders as are reasonable and necessary or as otherwise \nprovided by law.”33 Here, at the last minute the Company is being asked to make nonpublic, trade \nsecret data public so that the OAG can publicly disclose it in this proceeding, despite the \nCompany’s compliance with a pre-existing, mutually agreed (including by the Company, OAG, \nDepartment of Commerce, and all other parties to the case) Protective Order issued by the \nAdministrative Law Judge in this case. Notably, OAG does not suggest that the Company has \nfailed to comply with the pre-agreed Protective Order. Finally, as previously noted, within the \nCommission’s own procedural rules “[n]othing in [Minn. R. Ch. 7829, governing Utility \nProceeding, Practice, and Procedure] requires public disclosure of protected data or any disclosure \nof privileged data.”34  \nII. Disclosure of This Data Poses a Significant Risk of Harm to the Company  \nThe MGDPA protects information “that derives independent economic value, actual or \npotential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means \nby, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.”35 The OAG \nerroneously argues that confidential data can only confer economic value if it offers a competitive \nadvantage to one regulated utility vis a vis another utility. In doing so, the OAG implies that a \nregulated utility faces no competition and therefore cannot claim trade secret protection for the \n \n33 Minn. R. 1400.6700, Subp. 4.  \n34 Minn. R. 7829.0500, Subp. 1.  \n35 Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd 1(b) (emphasis added).  \n8 \n information marked trade secret in Attachment 26.02 TS and the Company’s OAG IR No. 42 \nResponse.  \nA plain reading of the statute suggests that the third prong of the definition is not limited \nto competitors, let alone “competitors” according to the OAG’s overly narrow definition. Nor is it \nlimited to only information that gives other persons a “competitive advantage.” Nothing in the \nstatute narrows the third prong of the trade secret definition to only those scenarios in which a \nregulated utility faces direct competition from another regulated utility. Instead, the analysis \nshould focus on whether the redacted data genuinely holds economic value because it is not \npublicly available. That is clearly the case here. Further, even under a restrictive reading of the \nstatute in which the redacted information must give a third-party a “competitive advantage,” the \ndisclosure of the redacted information contained in Attachment 26.02 TS and the Company’s OAG \nIR No. 42 Response still meet this standard.  \nA. The Information Contained in Attachment 26.02 TS Derives Economic Value \nfrom Not Being Generally Known to or Readily Ascertainable by Other \nPersons \nThe redacted information contained within Attachment 26.02 TS and the OAG IR No. 42 \nResponse has economic value derived from not being known because it includes customer-specific \ninformation that is confidential and critical to protecting the Company and its customers in ongoing \nand future negotiations with other Company customers.36  \nFirst, Attachment 26.02 TS contains long term financial forecasts, which may be used by \ncurrent investors to make investment determinations.37 The spreadsheet was not prepared to be \nshared with investors in public markets, as it lacks proper disclaimers or contextual information \n \n36 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.c. \n37 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.a. \n9 \n that would indicate it should not be relied upon for investment purposes, and could potentially lead \nto misguided investment decisions based on outdated or incomplete data.38 \nSecond, the overall document is the Company’s proprietary approach to forecasting rate \nscenarios.39 Releasing the complete document, or even only certain lines or cells, allows interested \npersons to deduce the confidential mechanics underlying the Company’s broader forecasting \nprocesses and undermine the Company’s confidential business planning efforts.40 \nThird, even if the model were not live, the overall analysis and results of  the spreadsheet \nwere derived from a high-level modeling exercise of potential revenue requirements based on a \nset of assumptions at a point in time.41 Making the outputs of such scenario planning public would \nundermine the proprietary nature of the Company’s scenario planning processes, and mistakenly \ncause third parties to take the inputs or outputs out of context.42 \nFourth, the results of Attachment 26.02 TS reflect one scenario prepared by the Company \nand it does not represent a forecast vetted for public disclosure.43 Assumptions within the forecast \nchange regularly, and the disclosure of this data could harm the Company’s standing with \ncustomers even though it is not any particular outcome the Company expects it or customers to \nexperience and the underlying assumptions have already shifted.44 The actual level of required \nrevenue will very likely change based on a multitude of factors over this time period, including \nunknowable potential future decisions of the Commission in cost recovery proceedings.45 \nImportantly, Paragraph 2(e) of the Protective Order also provides that “All protected data furnished \n \n38 Id.  \n39 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.b. \n40 Id.  \n41 Taran Decl. ¶ 8. \n42 Id.  \n43 Taran Decl. ¶ 10.  \n44 Id.  \n45 Id.  \n10 \n in this proceeding shall be… [u]sed solely for the purposes of this proceeding, and not used or \ndisclosed for any other purpose or in any other manner, without an order from the Administrative \nLaw Judge.”46 In this context, there is a substantial risk that public disclosure could create \nunnecessary public prejudgment about future rate increases that may never materialize.47  \nB. Even Under the OAG’s Restrictive Understanding of “Competitive \nAdvantage,” the Potential Harm to Minnesota Power Is Plain  \nWhile the OAG contends that the Company has “captive” customers and thus faces no \ntraditional competition, the Company does compete for favorable terms with large power \ncustomers that collectively account for a substantial portion of its load. Disclosure of these \ncustomers’ rate information could allow interested parties, such as large power customers, to \nunfairly benefit from insights into the Company’s strategic positioning, potentially disadvantaging \nthe Company’s standing with other customer classes.48 \nThis is true in several respects. First, Attachment 26.02 TS contains rate information for \nmunicipal customers with specific contracts.49 Disclosing this information could harm the \nCompany’s ability to negotiate future contracts with these customers or similar customers in the \nfuture.50  \nSecond, the information contained in the Attachment 26.02 TS, particularly in regard to \nrate information by customer class, is critical to protecting competitive advantages.51 Specifically, \nthe Company has a small number of large industrial customers who, with access to this level of \ndata, could discern other customers’ rates based on the Company’s projections by class and the \n \n46 Protective Order and Protective Order for Trade Secret Data ¶ 2(e).  \n47 Taran Decl. ¶ 10.  \n48 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.d.ii.  \n49 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.c.ii. \n50 Id. \n51 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.d.i. \n11 \n customers’ knowledge of their own contracts.52 This is discussed in more detail in Section III, \nbelow. Giving large industrial customers such information would likewise potentially give them \ninsights into each other’s contracts and operational strategies, thereby compromising the \ncompetitive landscape.53  \nThird, release of the rate forecast contained in Attachment 26.02 TS will directly affect the \nCompany’s ability to attract new customers and impact future contract negotiations.54 Electric \nutilities throughout Minnesota are working to attract new, large commercial customers, such as \ndata centers, to their service territories. Disclosing the commercially sensitive and customer-\nspecific information would unequivocally give interested third parties a competitive advantage, or \npotentially put Minnesota Power at a disadvantage relative to other utilities who are not compelled \nto disclose such forecasts (particularly when they are not intended to indicate any particular future \nrate forecast). \nIn short, whether viewed under the plain language of the MGDPA (protecting data that \nconfers economic value from remaining confidential) or under the OAG’s incorrect assumption \nthat only “competitors” matter, the redacted information in Attachment 26.02 TS and the \nCompany’s OAG IR No. 42 Response satisfies the third prong of the MGDPA’s trade secret \ndefinition and, thus, should not be publicly disclosed. The harm of disclosure would be real, \nsignificant, and contrary to the public interest, which the MGDPA is designed to protect.  \n \n52 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.c.i. \n53 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.d.i. \n54 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.d.iii. \n12 \n C. Partial Disclosure Would Invite Third Parties to Reverse Engineer or Back \nInto Proprietary Data and Calculations  \nThe OAG suggested that partial redaction or targeted disclosure of the spreadsheet’s \ncontents would be a sufficient alternative solution.55 However, this approach fails to consider the \ninherent risks involved in releasing only portions of Attachment 26.02 TS.  \nBy providing partial access to the document, the Company would open the door for third \nparties to reverse engineer the underlying data and calculations, which would compromise the \nintegrity of the Company’s trade secrets. This concern is especially pronounced here because the \nCompany has a smaller number of large power customers that collectively account for a \ndisproportionately high share of its load, making the data easier to piece together.56 For example, \nif only certain rate projections or revenue assumptions are made public, interested parties, like \nlarge industrial customers who already have insights into its own actual data and forecasts, could \nuse this information to “back into” the remaining calculations and assumptions that were not \ndisclosed.57  \nWhen coupled with other publicly available information, such as what is included in the \nCompany’s response to OAG IR No. 42 and the known rates for the forecast period, these parties \ncould deduce information about other customer classes, including negotiated rates with other \nindustrial customers.58 This would provide them with a tactical advantage in negotiating with the \nCompany. And because the Company must recover a certain quantity of revenue to cover its cost \nof service, which are allocated (shared) between customer classes, lower revenue from one large \nindustrial customer translates to higher rates for other customers. Therefore, making this \n \n55 OAG Motion at 5. \n56 Taran Decl. ¶ 9.c.i. \n57 Id.  \n58 Id.  \n13 \n information public would provide a direct a competitive advantage with respect to the Company’s \nnegotiations with some customers and would translate into a disadvantage for other customers. \nUltimately, this process of reverse engineering proprietary data would make it much easier \nfor interested third parties to figure out the details of the Company’s strategic positioning by giving \nthem valuable information that was intended to remain confidential and arming them with leverage \nin future negotiations. By disseminating even a fraction of these highly sensitive and carefully \nguarded details, the Company’s trade secrets and strategic business information would be severely \ncompromised, defeating the purpose of any confidentiality protections. \nIII. The Nature of this Data and the Trade Secret Justifications Provided are Routinely \nProtected by the Commission.  \nThe OAG states that “reciting the statutory definition cannot support ALLETE’s claim that \nits projections of customer rate impacts are trade secret.”59 However, this argument, and the \nreliance on Rahr Malting Co ., is misplaced. In general, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission \n(“Commission”) favors simplistic justifications for trade secrets designations.60 The nature of the \ndata contained in Attachment 26.02 TS and the Company’s OAG IR No. 42 response is routinely \nconsidered nonpublic and justified using the favored simplistic justifications.61  \n \n59 OAG Motion at 4 (citing In re Rahr Malting Co ., 632 N.W.2d 572, 576 (Minn. 2001)).  \n60 See In re 1998 Annual Automatic Adjustment of Charges , Docket No. E-999/AA-98-1130, O RDER ACCEPTING \nANNUAL AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT REPORTS  at 5 (Aug. 23, 1999) (“While the use of the trade secret designation is \nsometimes necessary and useful, the practice carries with it certain complications, such as difficulties in preparing \nregulatory documents. Utilities should remain conscious of the balancing of interests when materials are marked ‘trade \nsecret.’ For this reason, the Commission continues to favor requiring a simple justification of the ‘trade secret’ claim \nfor each piece of information so designated.”) \n61 See e.g. In the Matter of the Application by Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E015/GR-23-155, I NITIAL FILING VOLUME 1 – NOTICE OF CHANGE IN RATES AND INTERIM \nPETITION  at 3-16 (Nov. 1, 2023 ); In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Company for Authority to \nIncrease Rates for Electric Service in the State of Minnesota - 2019 Sales Actual Data and Related Revenue \nCalculations Submitted by Northern States Power Company d/b/a Xcel Energy (Xcel Energy), Pursuant to the \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission’s June 12, 2017 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order , Docket \nNo. E-002/GR-15-826, O RDER at Attachment 1 pg. 14 (May 22, 2020) (justifying the trade secret designation in IR \nrequests as “Attachment A is marked “Not-Public” as it includes information the Company considers to be trade secret \ndata as defined by Minn. Stat. § 13.37(1)(b). The information has independent economic value from not being \ngenerally known to and not being readily ascertainable by other parties who could obtain economic value from its \ndisclosure or use.”) \n14 \n For example, in the Company’s latest rate case, the Company offered similar language to \njustify the protection of sales and pricing data.62 In justifying trade secret designations in that case, \nthe Company stated:  \n“The information in Table 5 includes sales data the Company considers to be trade \nsecret information protected by the Minnesota Data Practices Act. This information \nhas economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not \nbeing readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons and is subject to \nefforts by the Company to protect the information from public disclosure or use. \nFor this reason, the Company asks that the data be treated as nonpublic data \npursuant to Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b).”63  \nThe Company also stated: \n“The information contained in this table includes capacity price information the \nCompany considers to be trade secret, as defined by Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b). \nThis information has important economic value to Minnesota Power as a result of \nthis information remaining not public, and Minnesota Power has taken reasonable \nprecautions to maintain its confidentiality.64 \nThe OAG was a party to the Company’s latest rate case and did not suggest that such \njustifications were inadequate. Further, the OAG was also a party to the other cited instances where \nsimilar justification language was used, and the OAG never took issue with the justification \nlanguage either. When providing this justification, the Company was following the long-standing \nrecognized trade secret justification favored by the Commission.  \nAdditionally, the Commission has routinely protected designated trade secrets from \ndisclosure when disclosure of the trade secret data is irrelevant to the docket or may harm \nbargaining positions and customer negotiations.65 In Docket No. ET-2/RP-14-813, the \n \n62 See In the Matter of the Application by Minnesota Power for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , Docket No. E015/GR-23-155, I NITIAL FILING VOLUME 1 – NOTICE OF CHANGE IN RATES AND INTERIM \nPETITION  at 3-16 (Nov. 1, 2023). \n63 Id. at 8. \n64 Id. \n65 See In the Matter of Great River Energy’s 2015-2029 Resource Plan , Docket No. RT-2/RP-14-813,  ORDER \nDENYING MOTION TO COMPEL , ACCEPTING RESOURCE PLAN, AND SETTING FUTURE FILING REQUIREMENTS  at 7 \n(October 25, 2015); In the Matter of the Annual Filing of Cogeneration and Small Power Production Rates , Docket \nNo. E999/PR-19-09, O RDER ACCEPTING TRADE SECRET DESIGNATIONS AND REQUIRING PUBLIC FILINGS  at 8-9 (Feb. \n21, 2020).  \n15 \n Commission denied a motion to compel disclosure of certain Great River Energy (“GRE”) cost \ndata, finding that GRE had demonstrated these figures were both sensitive and irrelevant to the \nprecise resource-planning questions at issue.66 Specifically, GRE’s operations and maintenance \ncosts were deemed competitively sensitive because releasing them could impair GRE’s bargaining \nposition in wholesale market transactions and customer negotiations.67 The Commission noted that \nno party had shown the public release of these numbers to be necessary for evaluating GRE’s \noverall resource plan, and thus allowed the information to remain designated as trade secret.68 \nSimilarly, in Docket No. E-999/PR-19-09, the Commission concluded that classifying \ncertain avoided-cost data as trade secret was consistent with the MGDPA because public disclosure \nof that specific information could allow bidders to manipulate pricing.69 The utilities argued that \ndisclosing detailed cost data would allow potential bidders to tailor bids to the utilities’ internal \nestimates, potentially raising prices above a truly competitive level.70 Opponents of trade secret \nprotection countered that the information should be publicly available to satisfy federal and state \n“public inspection” obligations.71 The Commission ultimately found that protecting the data was \njustified under the MGDPA, concluding that making this information public might compromise \nutilities’ negotiation positions and increase costs for ratepayers.72  \nIn both instances, the Commission balanced transparency against the potential harm of \ndisclosure. Where the data’s relevance to the proceedings was minimal and its disclosure \n \n66 See In the Matter of Great River Energy’s 2015-2029 Resource Plan , Docket No. RT-2/RP-14-813,  ORDER \nDENYING MOTION TO COMPEL , ACCEPTING RESOURCE PLAN, AND SETTING FUTURE FILING REQUIREMENTS  at 7 \n(October 25, 2015). \n67 Id.  \n68 Id.  \n69 In the Matter of the Annual Filing of Cogeneration and Small Power Production Rates , Docket No. E999/PR-19-\n09, O RDER ACCEPTING TRADE SECRET DESIGNATIONS AND REQUIRING PUBLIC FILINGS  at 8-9 (Feb. 21, 2020). \n70 Id. \n71 Id. \n72 Id. \n16 \n threatened to undermine the utilities’ ability to negotiate favorable terms, the Commission \nprotected it as trade secret. The same reasoning should be applied here because public disclosure \nof the commercially sensitive data contained within Attachment 26.02 TS and the Company’s \nOAG IR No. 42 Response could harm the Company’s ability to fairly negotiate contracts with new \nand existing customers, and the information the OAG seeks to make public is irrelevant to the \nproceeding at hand. \nEven if the justification were not sufficient in the discovery response (which is not the \ncase), that does not end the inquiry. Rahr  stands in part for the proposition that it is the trier of \nfact’s responsibility to inquire carefully before deciding whether or not to protect arguably \nnonpublic data, not that there is an assumption to make disputed data public.73 In Rahr , the \ntaxpayer’s request to protect information amounted to little more than an assertion that disclosure \nwould be “devastating,” without explaining how the information satisfies trade secret criteria.74 \nRather, than requiring the data to be made public, the Minnesota Supreme Court remanded to \nensure the taxpayer had the opportunity to present sufficient facts to demonstrate that its \ninformation constituted a protectable trade secret.75 \nBy contrast, the Company has provided a justification for redacting the information in \nAttachment 26.02 TS and the Company’s OAG IR No. 42 Response – a justification, as shown \nabove, that has been adequate in the past. The mere fact the OAG in unhappy with it is irrelevant \nto the analysis. Additionally, unlike in Rahr , the Company did not provide “conclusory allegations \nof harm.” Instead, the Company, in an effort to be as transparent as possible while protecting \n \n73 In re Rahr Malting Co ., 632 N.W.2d at 576 (Minn. 2001) (“The tax court is in the best position to weigh the \ncompeting needs and interests of the parties.”) \n74 Id. (“that disclosure of the data would be ‘devastating’ and affect the ‘survivability’ of the company. Although Rahr \nclaims some of the information it seeks to protect constitutes trade secrets, Rahr does not explain how the information \nsatisfies the criteria established in Minn. Stat. § 325C.01, subd. 5 (2000).”) \n75 Id. at 577. \n17 \n confidential information, provided a fulsome response to OAG IR No. 42 as largely public, \ndesignating only the numeric estimated average rate change included in the model as trade secret.76 \nAnd rather than inquiring further if it was unsatisfied and enabling a supplemental discovery \nresponse, the OAG waited several months and only sought to confer with a motion to compel \nalready prepared. Thus, the Company here has more than met its burden of demonstrating that the \nredacted information is highly sensitive and warrants trade secret protection.  \nIn sum, the OAG’s suggestion that reciting the statutory definition is an inadequate basis \nfor a trade secret claim overlooks the Commission’s long-standing practice of accepting concise \njustifications for designating sensitive data as nonpublic. Repeatedly, the Commission has \nprotected cost, pricing, and other competitively sensitive information when it has little or no \nbearing on the central issues in a docket and could harm a utility’s bargaining position if disclosed. \nConsequently, the Company has more than met its burden of demonstrating that the redacted \ninformation is legitimately protectable as trade secret. \nIV. The OAG has Not Established that the Proper Presentation of OAG’s Case Within \nthis Docket Requires the Nonpublic Information to Be Made Public, nor that the \nMotion is Not for Purposes of Delay.  \nAs stated above in Section I, the OAG’s Motion seeks to compel the Company to publicly \ndisclose a model and modeling data that the Company has properly designated as trade secret. \nHowever, there is no showing that the information must be made public for the proper \nrepresentation of a party’s case, or that the motion is not for the purposes of delay.  \nHere, there is no dispute that the OAG’s (and DOC’s) legal counsel and witness have access \nto all of the data it seeks to make public, as do all parties, under the existing Protective Order. \nFurther, because the data is not highly confidential, any representative who signs the non-\n \n76 Brama Decl. ¶ 8. \n18 \n disclosure agreement may review and rely upon these materials to advocate on behalf of customers \nwithout the need to publicly disclose proprietary information. Commission Staff, this tribunal, and \nthe Commission likewise have access. As such, there is no showing that the data needs to be made \npublic for any party to properly make its case or for the Commission or the ALJ to evaluate the \nrecord. \nDespite this, the OAG makes generalized policy arguments about transparency, but fails to \narticulate how public disclosure of this confidential commercial data is necessary. The Department \nof Commerce (“DOC”) similarly makes a blanket statement about the public interest without \nshowing justification.77 However, they fail to identify how making this confidential and \nproprietary information public is actually necessary, let alone beneficial. As previously discussed, \nthe data is not determinative of future outcomes and the Company is not suggesting any particular \nfuture rate scenario. Moreover, making this data publicly available would provide competitive \nadvantages to parties who could misuse it for their own strategic purposes, including in \nnegotiations with the Company.78 This is potentially detrimental to customers, who do not benefit \nif one customer uses proprietary information to obtain favorable outcomes at the expense of other \ncustomers.  \nFinally, the data the OAG seeks to make public is not particularly relevant to this \nproceeding, meaning that any asserted need for transparency is particularly low – calling into \nquestion the OAG’s claimed motivation for seeking to make confidential commercial data public. \nThe timing and approach of the OAG’s Motion reinforce the concerns regarding the OAG’s intent. \nFor more than two months following the Company’s initial disclosure of this information in \n \n77 See Department of Commerce’s Memorandum in Support of OAG’s Motion to Lift Trade Secret Designations at 2 \n(March 25, 2025) (eDocket No. 20253-216782-01 ) (“There is clearly a significant public interest regarding this \ninformation.”) \n78 Taran Decl. ¶ 9. \n19 \n response to Sierra Club IR No. 26 and subsequently to OAG IR No. 42, the OAG did not object to \nthe Company's trade secret designations. Yet, on March 13, 2025, weeks before the evidentiary \nhearing and while the Company’s counsel were traveling, the OAG suddenly demanded removal \nof the trade secret designations.79 The OAG did not set a deadline for its conferral in its March 13 \nletter, but on Monday, March 17 the OAG insisted on a same-day deadline for conferral, threatened \nto move immediately if its demands were not met, and quickly filed its Motion when the parties \ndid not come to a resolution.80 The OAG’s belated request, compressed deadlines, and refusal to \nengage in meaningful discussion do not suggest a need for the proper presentation of its case – \nrather, they call into question whether the OAG is seeking to disrupt preparations for these \nproceedings and/or to publicize irrelevant data at some future time in an effort to solicit public \nsupport for its positions. \nFinally, the December 5, 2024 Protective Order on which all parties agreed specifies that \n“Protected data for which a designation is removed shall not be made public until five (5) days \nafter the determination, or another time as determined by the Administrative Law Judge, to provide \nan opportunity to seek further review of the determination.”81 The five-day window was agreed to \nby all parties in the proceeding, as a reasonable period for a party to assess the determination and \nwhat, if any, next steps should be taken. As such, even if the OAG’s Motion were granted in any \nrespect, the underlying data still could not be made public until after the close of the evidentiary \nhearing. Given this timing, OAG’s motion does not appear to be tailored to actual needs for the \nrecord in this case and again calls into question the intended purpose of seeking that the \ninformation be made public. \n \n79 Brama Decl. ¶ 10. \n80 Brama Decl. ¶¶ 10-12. \n81 Protective Order, Paragraphs 11(c) and 13. \n20 \n Overall, the economic value of maintaining confidentiality significantly outweighs any \nmarginal public benefit gained from disclosure. The data in question contains proprietary modeling \nand commercially sensitive projections that, if publicly disclosed, could be misused by competitors \nor other parties for strategic advantage in negotiations with the Company. The Company has \nlegitimate, ongoing commercial interests in preserving the confidentiality of its modeling and \nproprietary data. Conversely, the public interest in understanding high-level financial forecasts is \nrelatively limited when compared to the potential harm caused by disclosure. And by waiting until \nthe final stage of the contested case to challenge the existing designation and then insisting on \nunreasonably short response times, the OAG has failed to demonstrate that its Motion is not for \nthe purposes of delay or disruption. Accordingly, the Motion must be denied. \nV. Partial Disclosure with Continued Protection of Proprietary Information Contained \nWithin the OAG’s Request in OAG IR No. 42  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and appreciates that, despite \nthe OAG’s position that much of the information in Attachment 26.02 TS does not warrant trade \nsecret protection, the OAG took care to mark OAG IR No. 42 as nonpublic to avoid inadvertently \nviolating the protective order in this proceeding.82 The Company also acknowledges that portions \nof the OAG’s request in OAG IR. No. 42 can be unredacted, with the exception of questions A.4, \nincluding footnote 1, and B.1 that contain information based on the redacted trade secret \ninformation contained in Attachment 26.02 TS.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Company respectfully requests that the Administrative \nLaw Judge deny the OAG's Motion to Lift Trade Secret Designations. The information contained \nin Attachment 26.02 TS  and the  OAG IR No. 42 Response clearly meets the definition of trade \n \n82 OAG Motion at Exhibit C.  \n21 \n secret under the MGDPA, therefore, the Company respectfully requests that the trade secret \ndesignations remain intact in its entirety. \n  \n  \n Dated: March 31, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \n \n   ____________________ \nElizabeth M.

The Company provided the following justification for designating the information\ncontained in Attachment 26.02 TS as trade secret:\n5. On January 16, 2025, the OAG served the Company with OAG IR No. 42 seeking\nclarifications regarding Attachment 26.02 TS.\nindicate any concerns with the Company’s trade secret designation of the underlying\nAttachment 26.02 TS on which OAG IR No. 42 was premised.\nCompany’s response to Question A.4 of OAG IRNo. 42, the Company marked the average\nrate increase number, which was from the model in Attachment 26.02 TS, as trade secret.\nIR 42 to the extent the request sought information that is not relevant or proportional to the\nneeds of the case, as the Company has not requested and is not anticipating any particular\nrate change as part of this proceeding or as a result of the Acquisition. However, the\nCompany responded to OAG IR No. 42 over the objection, as described above.\n1 Minn. R. 7829.0500, subp. 3 description omitted.\n2The information designated as trade secret herein is financial information \nand is designated as such because this information is not generally known \nto and not readily ascertainable by investors and competitors of the7. On January 29, 2025, the Company provided its response to OAG IR No. 42. In the\n8. As indicated in the Company’s OAG IR No. 42 Response, the Company objected to OAG6.

The Company provided the following justification for the designation:SIERRA CLUB IR 0026.02 Attach TS includes trade secret information as \ndefined by Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b). This information derives \nindependent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally \nknown to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other \npersons who can obtain value from its disclosure or use. Thus, the Company \nhas made reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. Because the Company \nhas classified the entire document as trade secret information, the Company \nprovides the following description of the excised material as required by \nMinn. R. 7829.0500, subp. 3: []1\n\n10. Waiting until more than two months after the Company served its response to Sierra Club\nIR 26, during the afternoon of Thursday, March 13, 2025, the OAG served a letter on the\nCompany by email and U.S. Mail requesting that the Company voluntarily remove trade­\nsecret designations from SIERRA IR 0026.02 Attach TS and from its response to OAG IR\nNo. 42 and requesting to meet and confer regarding the OAG’s request. The OAG did not\nstate a deadline for its conferral. A copy of the OAG’s letter is attached as Exhibit A.\nprovided automatic out of office responses to inform email senders, like the OAG, that I\nwas traveling.\n12. On Monday, March 17, at 10:13 A.M., I received an email from counsel for the OAG that\nstated the OAG would file a motion to compel public disclosure of the nonpublic material\nif the Company did not respond by 1:00 P.M. that day. I responded at 10:21 A.M. that same\nday, and met with counsel for the OAG at the mutually agreed time of 2:00 P.M. that same\nday. During the conferral, the OAG stated it might withhold its motion if the Company\nagreed to a partial resolution. After the conferral, at 2:46 P.M. that same day, the OAG sent\nan email identifying extensive unredactions to which the Company needed to agree by 4:00\npm that same day or else the OAG would file its motion. In light of the confidentiality of\nthe underlying model and data, as well as the time provided and in light of the OAG’s\nunreasonable demands, the parties did not come to a resolution.\n3Company who could obtain economic value from its disclosure.

I also offer to meet and confer with \nALLETE regarding this request to remove trade- secret designations.  \n \nSierra Club IR No. 26 requested, among other things, “the estimated annual revenue \nrequirement” and the “monthly bill  impacts for an average residential customer” associated with \nMinnesota Power’s forecasted capital expenditures.1  In response, ALLETE provided, as \nAttachment 26.02, an Excel spreadsheet with “detail on the portion of [ALLETE’s]  estimated \nrevenue requirements that are anticipated to be collected from Minnesota Power customers ” in \n2023–2032.2   \n \nALLETE provided its response to Sierra Club IR No. 26 to the OAG.  The OAG then sent \nALLETE an information request, OAG IR No. 42 , to better understand Attachment 26.02.  In its \nresponse , ALLETE describes the calculations  performed  in Attachment 26.02 .  Despite asserting \nthat Attachment 26.02 is “a nonpublic model” in its entirety, ALLETE  designat es only 12 words \nof its response to OAG IR No. 42 as trade secret .3   \n \nThe OAG marked its questions  in IR No. 42 as nonpublic to avoid  inadvertently violating  \nthe protective order in this case.  But the OAG does not agree  that much, if any, of  the information \ncontained in Attachment 26.02 meets the definition of “trade secret .”4   \n \n1 ALLETE Response to Sierra Club IR No. 26 at 1. \n2 Id. at 2. \n3 See ALLETE Response to OAG IR No. 42 at 3– 5. \n4 See Protective Order and Protective Order for Trade Secret Data  at 2 (Dec. 5, 2024) \n(incorporating definition of “trade secret” from Minn.

The Act provides that “[a]ll government data \ncollected, created, received, maintained or disseminated by a government entity shall be public  \nunless classified by statute  . . . as nonpublic or protected nonpublic .”5  The presumption that \ngovernment data is public reflects “ a fundamental commitment to making the operations of our \npublic institutions open to the public.”6  As a result , the courts construe the Act in favor of public \naccess  to information held by government agencies.7 \n \nTrade secret data are a type of “nonpublic data” that are exempt from the Act’s public -\ndisclosure requirement.8  “Trade secret data” means  “government data . . . (1) that was supplied \nby the affected individual or organization, (2) that is the subject of efforts by the individual or \norganization that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy, and (3) that \nderives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and \nnot being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value \nfrom its disclosure or use .”9 \n \nALLETE’s response to Sierra Club IR No. 26 claims without explanation that Attachment \n26.02 “ derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known \nto, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain value \nfrom its disclosure or use. ”10  But m erely reciting the statutory definition  cannot  support  \nALLETE’s claim that its projections of customer rate impacts are trade secret.11  On the contrary, \ncursory review of Attachment 26.02 and ALLETE’s description of the attachment in response to \nOAG IR No. 42 strongly suggests that it is not entitled to trade -secret protection. \n \nAttachment 26.02 contains projections of Minnesota Power’s future rate increases broken \ndown by customer class.  Data about pricing for individual, large customers may have independent \neconomic value to a utility if there is a risk that th ose customers could be poached by providers of \nalternative fuels.12  In general, however, Minnesota Power ’s ratepayers are captive  and have no \nalternatives.13  As a result, there appears  to be little if any competitive advantage  for ALLETE  of \nmaintaining the secrecy of these projected rate increases.   \n \nIt is hard to fathom what a competitor of ALLETE, if one exists, would do with the rate-\nincrease  information in Attachment 26.02.

But ALLETE has not demonstrated that a competitor \ncould derive economic value from any of the assumptions used in Attachment 26.02.  The \nattachment reflects assumptions about the overall rate increase Minnesota Power ratepayers will \nexperience by 2032, as well as each class’s base revenue and annual sales volume over that \nperiod.17  If ALLETE believes that  assumptions in Attachment 26.02 are trade secret, ALLETE \nneeds to explain why  each assumption it wishes not to disclose derives economic value from not \nbeing disclosed.  And even  if ALLETE can make this showing, the proper course of action would \nbe targeted redaction only of the trade -secret assumptions, rather than of the entire document as \nALLETE has done .18 \n \nThe public has an interest in understanding the potential rate impacts of ALLETE’s capital -\nspending plans.

Learn why this is important\nHello,\nAs a resident of Duluth and a lifelong resident of Minnesota, I oppose the acquisition of MN\npower/Allete. \nMN power has an excellent track record of quality service, environmental stewardship, and\nlow rates. This is a huge reason for businesses and people to choose to reside in this area. \nPurchase by a private equity firm would reduce the quality of service and increase rates for\nMinnesota families already struggling with the costs of groceries, childcare(!), housing,heating, and layoffs.\nAdditionally, as an employer, this organization has been a fantastic place for those hoping to\nbuild a career in Duluth. It has been a pillar of the best technology and skilled trade jobs. Theeconomic impact of a reduction in those jobs would be large.\nThanks for your consideration,\nEdward KnudsenPiedmont neighborhoodDuluth, MN 55811"

A REASONABLE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 1 \nPUBLIC INTEREST  2 \nQ. Has CURE expressed concerns about the potential for private gain from the 3 \nAcquisition ?  4 \nA. Yes. CURE Witness Ellis takes multiple positions that are at odds with state regulatory 5 \ncommissions, including the Commission, one of which is that the Acquisition cannot be 6 \nconsistent with the public interest because it results in private gain.38 Witness Ellis 7 \ndescribes the franchised utility model as creating a “pocket -picking monopoly ,” the sale 8 \nof which unjustly enriches the selling owner if the owner profits from the sale.  However, 9 \nWitness Ellis’ proposal would require investors to rely solely on dividends to earn a 10 \nreturn , which would be detrimental to the utility’s business and stands in stark contrast 11 \nto the Partners’ approach of forgoing dividends to reinvest in the utility to provide longer 12 \nterm growth and value.  13 \nQ. Is it appropriate for the shareholders of ALLETE to earn a profit from this 14 \nAcquisition?  15 \nA. It is certainly appropriate for the owner of a company to bear the burdens and receive 16 \nthe benefits of that ownership, including a return on the owner’s investment. Witness 17 \nEllis appears to believe that the return on capital received by the utility through its rates 18 \nis the only return an investor should get from its investment in a utility.39 Anything 19 \nabove that is a “windfall” that the owner does not deserve. They could not earn a profit 20 \nfrom any subsequent sale of their ownership interest in the utility. This would mean no 21 \nutility owner could profit from a sale or else the sale would not be consistent with the 22 \npublic interest.   23 \n 24 \nQ. Is it appropriate for GIP to eventually earn a portion of its return from the sale of 25 \nALLETE ? 26 \nA. Yes. Just as public stockholders often earn part of their return by eventually selling 27 \npurchased stock,  we invest in portfolio companies for the same reason others make 28 \ninvestments: to earn a return from the investment. This is no different than ALLETE’s 29 \n \n38 CURE Ex. __ (ME) at 121 (“Ellis Direct”).  \n39 Ellis Direct at 22.  \n \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION HAS BEEN EXCISED\n\n \n 11 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Rebuttal  \n any interest in nor plan  to transform the operations of Minnesota Power to create 1 \noperating synergies by sharing services with other affiliated companies; purchasing and 2 \nsupply functions at the utility will remain consistent with the current procedures and 3 \ncontrols.  Second, the Partners and ALLETE have committed that the Company  will 4 \ncomply with the Commission’s affiliate transaction rules.  The Commission’s affiliate 5 \ntransaction rules have been in effect for a number of years and are already applied not 6 \nonly to ALLETE but also to Northern States Power Minnesota, Otter Tail Power, and 7 \nother jurisdictional utilities.  Third , Witness  Vavro’s concern is addressed by  two 8 \ncommitment s by ALLETE  and the Partners:   9 \n1. Minnesota Power will require all suppliers and industrial customers with special 10 \ncontracts  to identify annually whether they are more than 5% owned by CPPIB, GIP, 11 \nor Blackrock. Minnesota Power will list those entities in the annual affiliated interest 12 \nreport.19 13 \n2.  Minnesota Power will identify any contracts over $1 million with an entity identified 14 \npursuant to the prior commitment and notify the Commission within 30 days of the 15 \nexecution of each contract not already disclosed to the Commission and will certify  16 \nthat the contract was executed at arm's length .20 17 \n 18 \nQ.  What other deficiency does Witness  Vavro  assert in the ring -fencing provisions?   19 \nA. 20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n 25 \n26 \n27  Witness Vavro indicates that while  the prote ctive provisions  are “generally consistent \nwith  those  that  have  been  propo sed  in  other   take-priva te  transactions,  they  are \ninsuff icient.”21 The alleged deficiency that she then point s out is the failure to obtain a \nlegal non-consol idation opini on that she asserts would provide  greater assurances that \nALLETE ’s assets woul d be prote cted in the event of a Parent or affiliate bankrup tcy.  \n \nPerhaps  Witness  Vavro  is  not  aware  that  it  is  not  possi ble  to  obtain  a  legal  non-\nconsol idation opi nion at this po int, before the close of  a transaction. Non-consol idation  \nopini ons  are  not  sought   in  most   merger  transactions,  but  if  such  a  legal  opini on  is 28 \n \n19 Cady Rebuttal Schedule 1.  \n20 Cady Rebuttal Schedule 1.  \n21 Vavro Direct at 20.  \n \n14 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nLapson  Rebuttal  \n and balance against “profit -driven decisions that could disadvantage ratepayers .”25 1 \nWitness  Quackenbush points out in his Rebuttal Testimony  that public market investors 2 \ngenerally pressure companies to pay out and increase dividends, an example of the 3 \npursuit of short -term objectives rather than long -term objectives.  4 \n 5 \nIt is the specific role and mandate of the Commission to balance the needs of ratepayers 6 \nand investors ; the Partners and the Company have clearly stated that they understand, 7 \nappreciate, and embrace this important role of the Commission .  8 \n 9 \nSecond, Witness  Lane also asserts that public financial reporting is a control on the 10 \nowners of utilities, creating accountability to ensure that decisions are made in the public 11 \ninterest.  It may come as a surprise to Witness  Lane that  the reason that companies with 12 \npublicly traded shares are required to file financial reports is as a protection to investors , 13 \nnot to defend the interests of utility ratepayers against “profit -driven decisions .”  14 \n 15 \nAfter  the transfer of ALLETE’s ownership from public market shareholders to private 16 \nshareholders, the company’s management  will have an ongoing commitment to provide 17 \nthe Commission with audited financial statements  and will continue to file its customary 18 \nfinancial reports about its utility division. Furthermore, the Commission has the 19 \nauthority to request information from the utility, including performance metrics, and to 20 \nrequire answers to questions. Nothing in Minnesota law or regulation requires that a 21 \nutility must file public financial statements.  That said, the Partners have committed  in 22 \ntheir rebuttal testimony to provide the Commission with audited financial statements of 23 \nALLETE and Alloy Parent.  24 \n 25 \nWitness  Lane asserts that public shareholders now play a role in oversight of the 26 \nCompany . Although  I question her view on this matter, as a private company  after the 27 \nAcquisition , ALLETE will have private shareholders  who will have a very large and 28 \n \n25 Lane Direct at 323.   \n\nIN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF MINNESOTA \nPOWER FOR ACQUISITION OF ALLETE  BY \nCANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD \nAND GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS  \n MPUC  DOCKET NO.
