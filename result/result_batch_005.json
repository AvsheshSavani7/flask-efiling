Minnesota Power estimated Total Company spending on \neconomic development to be $0.74 million in both the 2020 test year and the 2022 test year \nand $0.75 million in the 2024 test year in the most rec ent rate case. Future spending for \neconomic development would be maintained at these levels at a minimum.  \nNote that the Commission has historically allowed Minnesota Power to recover just 50 percent \nof economic development spending in base rates. For example, the 2024 test year included \n$.75 million of economic development costs and cost recovery of $.37 milli on (Total Company).  \nWitness: Jennifer Cady \nResponse Date: 09/04/2025 \nResponse by: Jennifer Cady \nEmail Address: jjcady@mnpower.com  \nPhone Number: 218- 355-3202 Witness: n/a \nResponse Date: 09/04/2025 \nResponse by: GIP \nEmail Address: discoverymanager@mnpower.com \nPhone Number: n/a Witness: n/a \nResponse Date: 09/04/2025 \nResponse by: CPP Investments \nEmail Address: discoverymanager@mnpower.com \nPhone Number: n/a"

Please e -file the Company’s response by September 4, 2025.  Please \nindicate where, if at all, your responses include trade secret information . \n \nRequest \nNumber 6 Please identify and describe the mechanism or mechanisms in the transaction \nor settlement documents that will guarantee that the Partners will provide \nAlloy Parent  with the capital needed to fund Minnesota Power at the level \nnecessary for the utility to comply with state law and continue to provide safe, \nreliable and affordable service to customers of Minnesota Power.   How would \nthe Commission enforce those mechanis ms should the Partners fail to do so?  \n \n \nResponse:    \n \nPlease see the response to PUC IR 0016 regarding enforcement.  Importantly, Alloy Parent is \nthe joint investment entity through which the Partners are investing in ALLETE —it is the entity \nthrough which all funding will flow to ALLETE and is the entity that will directly invest in ALLETE \nas its sole stockholder and thus will indirectly hold all the ALLETE assets. The Partners are only \nable to earn a return during the time they own ALLETE by receiving dividends. Settlement \nParagraph 1.4 provides that ALLETE will not make dividend payments to A lloy Parent if the \ncapital commitment is not met. This dividend limitation is very significant and not an authority \nthat the Commission has over the investors or parent companies of any other utility.  \n  \nShould the Partners ever choose to sell all or part of their respective ownership interests in \nALLETE, the Partners must obtain Commission approval before any sale of ownership in ALLETE, \nand the Commission could deny or place conditions on any sale if the  capital commitment is not \nmet.     \n   \n \n \nWitness: Jennifer Cady  \nResponse Date: 09/04/2025  \nResponse by: Jennifer Cady  \nEmail Address: jjcady@mnpower.com  \nPhone Number: 218 -355 -3202  \n Witness: n/a \nResponse Date: 09/04/2025  \nResponse by: GIP  \nEmail Address: discoverymanager@mnpower.com  \nPhone Number: n/a \n \n Witness: n/a \nResponse Date: 09/04/2025  \nResponse by: CPP Investments  \nEmail Address: discoverymanager@mnpower.com  \nPhone Number: n/a \n \n As a result, the Commission can enforce the capital commitment by enforcing the Settlement \nterms and limit the Partners’ access to any returns from their investment in ALLETE.  \n \nAs upstream owners of Alloy Parent, the Partners are impacted by financial consequences \ndirected at Alloy Parent. Settlement Paragraphs 1.73 and 1.74 provide that any commitments \nmade by Alloy Parent, including the capital commitment, are subject to the Co mmission’s \nauthority to seek fines for violating a Commission Order pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 216B.53 \nthrough .61. As a practical matter, if such fines were assessed to Alloy Parent, the Partners \nwould provide Alloy Parent with sufficient funds to pay the fines and does so. If the Partners \nwere to fail to support Alloy Parent in this way, as further explained in the response to PUC IR \n0016 regarding enforcement, because Alloy Parent is the joint investment entity through which \nthe Partners are investing in ALLETE, the Commission would have enforcement authority \ndirectly over the Partners’ investment in ALLETE, i.e., over the dividends payable to and assets \nheld by Alloy Parent.  \n \nFurther, Minn. Stat. § 216B.54 authorizes the Commission to refer violations of orders to the \nAttorney General, “who shall take appropriate legal action.” This “appropriate legal action” \nincludes the possibility to seek injunctive relief, which could inclu de a court order requiring \nAlloy Parent to provide the capital required by the Settlement. As explained above, because \nAlloy Parent is the entity to which all dividends from ALLETE will be issued, the entity that will \ndirectly invest in ALLETE, and the sol e stockholder and thus indirect holder of all the ALLETE \nassets, Alloy Parent is the appropriate entity through which such enforcement efforts are best \ndirected.  \n \nThe Partners cannot “abandon” Alloy Parent without abandoning their investment in ALLETE \nand will remain responsible for its financing and any enforcement actions against it. The \nPartners will invest $3.9 billion to purchase ALLETE, which will be owned onl y through Alloy \nParent. Further, the reputational damage of doing so, and the reputational damage of failing to \nabide by the commitments made in the merger agreement or in the Settlement Stipulation, \nwould be immeasurable and the consequences for the Partn ers’ other business operations \nwould be extraordinary, adversely affecting their ability to raise capital or make future \ninfrastructure investments that are the very essence of their business."
