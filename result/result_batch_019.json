INTRODUCTION AND Q UALIFICATIONS  1 \nQ. Please state your name , employer, and position . 2 \nA. My name is Jonathan Bram and I am a founding partner of Global Infrastructure 3 \nPartners, which is the trading name for Global Infrastructure Management, LLC along 4 \nwith related funds (collectively “GIP”).   5 \n 6 \nQ. Did you provide Direct Testimony , Rebuttal Testimony, and Surrebuttal 7 \nTestimony  in this proceeding?  8 \nA. Yes. 9 \n 10 \nQ. What is the purpose of your Response  Testimony ? 11 \nA. I am providing Response Testimony to address highly confidential trade secret 12 \ninformation that was admitted into the record as part of Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 on 13 \nthe final day of the evidentiary hearing in this proceeding.  Specifically,  on January 18, 14 \n2025, the P artners produced in  discovery to all parties  a GIP presentation to CalPERS 15 \nfrom September 2023 . On February 4, 2025, the Office of the Minnesota Attorney 16 \nGeneral – Residential Utilities Division (“OAG”) attached a version of the document to 17 \nthe Direct Testimony  of Witness Brian Lebens  as Schedule  BPL-D-8.  This document 18 \nwas admitted into evidence on April 1, 2025, as part of Hearing Exhibit OAG -401 19 \n(Lebens HCTS Rebuttal). At the evidentiary hearing on April 3, 2025, OAG moved to 20 \nadmit into the record a version  with certain redactions removed  and it was admitted as 21 \nHearing Exhibit OAG -412. G iven the timing , the Partners and the Company were 22 \nafforded an opportunity to submit response  testimony to address the additional 23 \ninformation.  24 \n 25 \nQ. Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding in connection with your 26 \nResponse Testimony?  27 \nA.

HEARING EXHIBIT OAG -412 1 \nQ. What is the document provided as Hearin g Exhibit OAG -412?  2 \nA. Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 is a document that was prepared by GIP in September 2023 3 \nto provide information to CalPERS, a potential investor in the Acquisition through 4 \nTower Bridge.  As a result, it reflects GIP’s understanding of certain facts, assumptions, 5 \nand conditions in September 2023.  The original Schedule BPL -D-8 omitted 6 \ninformation that is now in the evidentiary record through the admission of Hearing 7 \nExhibit OAG -412. 8 \n 9 \nQ. Is there any additional information in Exhibit OAG -412 that requires clarification 10 \nor context to avoid misunderstanding?  11 \nA. Yes. There is additional information in Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 that requires  12 \nadditional context or explanation to ensure a more complete record and avoid 13 \nmisunderstanding.  Specifically, Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 includes additional 14 \ninformation related to [ HCTS INFORMATION BEGINS …   15 \n   \n   \n   \n   … HCTS INFORMATION ENDS]   \n 20 \nA.

You mentioned the additional information also relates to [HCTS INFORMATION 4 \nBEGINS  …  … HCTS 5 \nINFORMATION ENDS ] Please explain that additional information and the 6 \nrelevant context or explanation.  7 \nA.

You explained that these are assumptions in GIP’s valuation model . Please explain 13 \nwhat that model is and how it is used.  14 \nA. It is not possible to know with certainty how an investment like the Partners’ acquisition 15 \nof ALLETE will develop over time or what return GIP or its investors will receive from 16 \nan investment. We conduct diligence to understand potential investments as best as we 17 \ncan, but there are inevitably things we will not know before they occur.  In order to 18 \nevaluate a potential investment, we have to make assumptions about certain facts and 19 \ntrends and consider a variety of possible scenarios, including the future performance of 20 \nthe company.  We then model the effect of different scenarios to understand how our 21 \ninvestment could be affected if those scenarios occur.  Those scenarios are not 22 \nnecessarily situations or things we think will happen or want to happen, but they are 23 \nscenarios we need to consider to fully evaluate the investment. We then take the outputs 24 \nof that model and include some of those in documents like the presentation in Hearing 25 \nExhibit OAG -412 to demonstrate potential (but not guaranteed) investment outcomes, 26 \nincluding both “upside” and “downside” cases.  27 \n 28 \nC.

You mentioned earlier that the information on the slides reflects GIP’s 1 \nunderstanding at  the time the document was created.  Please explain.  2 \nA. As is stated on the document itself, the statements made in the document [HCTS 3 \nINFORMATION BEGINS  …  4 \n   \n  … HCTS INFORMATION ENDS ] We also explained this when 6 \nproviding the document in discovery , noting that the presentation materials “represent 7 \nprojections, ranges of understanding, and scenario planning by GIP based on the 8 \ninformation available at the time, in many cases predating the undertaking or completion 9 \nof due diligence.”  We also explained that the content of the presentation “was prepared 10 \nfor limited purposes, may not reflect the current views of any party to the proposed 11 \nacquisition, and may include discussion that is not necessarily relevant to the federal or 12 \nstate regulatory processes.”4 13 \n 14 \nQ. Is there information you now understand to be incorrect or inaccurate within the 15 \ncontent added to the record via Hearing Exhibit OAG -412? 16 \nA. Yes, there are statements or materials in these portions of Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 17 \nthat GIP now understands are incorrect or inaccurate  or that would otherwise benefit 18 \nfrom additional context .  Company Witness Cady identifies a number of items that GIP 19 \nagrees today are not correct or require additional context.  Specifically:  [HCTS 20 \nINFORMATION BEGINS  … 21 \n   \n   \n  \n   \n   \n   \n \n3 Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 at slide 26 (exhibit page 31) . \n4 Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 at p. 2 . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION HAS BEEN EXCISED\n\n \n 9 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nBram  Response Testimony    \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n … HCTS INFORMATION ENDS ]  \n 16 \nQ. Is there additional information in Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 that could be 17 \nincorrect or inaccurate?  18 \nA.

Pursuant to the order allowing this Response Testimony, 20 \nI have limited this testimony to only the additional information that was allowed into 21 \nthe record during the evidentiary hearing, and do not, in this testimony, review the 22 \naccuracy of the rest of the document.  23 \n 24 \nPUBLIC DOCUMENT - HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET INFORMATION HAS BEEN EXCISED\n\n \n 10 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nBram  Response Testimony  III.

Cady, I am employed by ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power13 \nas Vice President of Regulatory and Legislative Affairs. 4 \n5 \nQ. Did you provide Direct Testimony in this proceeding? 6 \nA. Yes. 7 \n8 \nQ. Did you provide Rebuttal Testimony in this proceeding? 9 \nA. Yes. 10 \n11 \nQ. Did you provide Surrebuttal Testimony in this proceeding? 12 \nA. Yes. 13 \n14 \nQ. Did you provide testimony at the evidentiary hearing in this proceeding? 15 \nA. Yes. I provided an opening statement and was subject to cross -examination on April 1, 16 \n2025. 17 \n18 \nQ. What is the purpose of your Response  Testimony ? 19 \nA. I am providing Response Testimony to certain portions of Hearing Exhibit OAG -412, 20 \nas permitted by the Administrative Law Judge by oral ruling made on April 3, 2025 , on 21 \nbehalf of Minnesota Power. Global Infrastructure Partners’ (“GIP”) witness Jonathan 22 \nBram provides GIP’s perspective and additional information. 23 \n24 \nQ. Are you sponsoring any exhibits in this proceeding? 25 \nA. No. 26 \n27 \n1 Minnesota Power is a regulated operating division of ALLETE, Inc. Throughout this Surrebuttal  Testimony and \nthe Petition, “Minnesota Power” refers to this regulated utility operating in Minnesota. Unless otherwise \nspecifically defined, references to “ALLETE” indicate ALLETE, Inc., which is the entire enterprise including \nMinnesota Power and all re gulated and non -regulated subsidiaries. “The Company” is a more general reference to \nALLETE, Inc. d/b/a Minnesota Power.  \n\n2 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Response  II. RESPONSE TO HEARING EXHIBIT OAG -412 1 \nQ. What  is Hearing Exhibit OAG -412? 2 \nA. Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 is  the narrative and an attachment to GIP’s  third 3 \nsupplemental response to the Department of Commerce (“DOC”) information request 4 \n0012 (“DOC IR 0012 Supp 3 HCTS ”) served in this proceeding. 5 \n6 \nQ. Have you seen this document before? 7 \nA. Yes. I, along with other senior executives at the Company have access to highly 8 \nconfidential trade secret (“ HCTS ”) information that is not available to all of ALLETE, 9 \nand I reviewed it during the discovery process in this proceeding. 10 \n11 \nQ. Was any response to DOC IR 0012 previously in the record? 12 \nA. Yes. The Office of the Attorney General – Residential Utilities Division (“OAG -RUD”) 13 \nhad included DOC IR 001 2.02 Attach SUPP HCTS with the Direct Testimony of its 14 \nwitness, Brian P. Lebens, at Schedule BPL -D-8 (“BPL -D-8\") (Hearing Exhibit OAG - 15 \n401). At the evidentiary hearing, on April 3, 2025, the OAG -RUD moved DOC IR 16 \n0012.02 Attach Supp 3 HCTS for admission (with the cover narrative , as discussed 17 \nbelow ) as Hearing Exhibit OAG -412. 18 \n19 \nFrom a timing perspective, t he attachment to GIP’s response to DOC IR 0012 that 20 \nbecame BPL -D-8 was served on the OAG -RUD on October 9, 2024.2 Hearing Exhibit 21 \nOAG -412 was served on the OAG -RUD on January 18, 2025, but was not attached to 22 \nany pre -filed document in the case. BPL -D-8 was included with Witness Lebens’ Direct 23 \nTestimony, filed on February 4, 2025. The OAG did not file an errata or seek to 24 \nintroduce what was ultimately marked as Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 until the last day 25 \nof the evidentiary hearing (April 3, 2025) after the Company’s witnesses had completed 26 \ntheir live testimony and all parties waived questions for the Partners.  27 \n28 \n2 On October 9, 2024, GIP responded to OAG -RUD IR 0003, which requested copies of the responses to all other \nParties’ information requests in this proceeding. OAG -RUD access to information request responses provided by \nMinnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan I nvestment Board, and GIP was granted contemporaneously with that \nresponse.  \n\n3 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Response  Q. How do BPL -D-8 and  Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 differ?  1 \nA. BPL-D-8 is an earlier version of  GIP’s response to DOC IR 0012 and only includes 2 \nDOC IR 0012.02 Attach Supp HCTS. Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 includes a more recent 3 \nversion of DOC IR 0012 Attach, labeled “DOC IR 0012.02 Attach Supp 3 HCTS,” 4 \nwhich is the same document as BPL -D-8 except with additional material disclosed . 5 \n6 \nAt the request of the Company and the Partners, Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 also includes 7 \nthe narrative cover pages for GIP’s response to DOC IR 0012, which included  context 8 \nthat is important for Hearing Exhibit OAG -412, but which  was not included with any 9 \nwitness’s testimony.  10 \n11 \nQ. Why does it matter to the Company that the new material in Hearing Exhibit OAG - 12 \n412 was added to the record on the last day of the evidentiary hearing? 13 \nA. Because Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 was entered  into the record at the hearing through 14 \nWitness Lebens,  the Company did not previously have  an opportunity to address the 15 \ninformation included in Hearing Exhibit OAG -412 that was not included in BPL -D-8, 16 \nfound in Hearing Exhibit OAG -401. Several aspects of the new material are incorrect 17 \nwith respect to the Company, could negatively affect the Company if misperceived, and 18 \nneed context that neither the Company nor GIP had an opportunity to provide outside of 19 \nthis Response Testimony . 20 \n21 \nQ. Why was it important to provide context about the new information included in 22 \nHearing Exhibit OAG -412? 23 \nA. As part of this Acquisition and regulatory process, ALLETE executive leadership has 24 \nlong understood that the Partners have explored  various scenarios  and made 25 \nassumption s or advanced hypothetical s in the course of evaluating bidding on and 26 \nultimately negotiating an Acquisition of ALLETE , as is a normal matter of course in 27 \ncomplex business transactions , and that some of those assumptions are simply incorrect . 28 \nAs the deal matured and the Partners had further opportunity to get to  know the 29 \nCompany, it became clear that several items in the material added to this record through 30 \nHearing Exhibit OAG -412 are examples of just such issues. While it is important to note 31 \n\n4 OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nCady Response  that the Acquisition is not based on individual scenarios or early assumptions that turned 1 \nout to be correct or incorrect , the Company is concerned that the information OAG - 2 \nRUD  seeks to add at the end of the evidence -taking process is not only incorrect in some 3 \nways I describe here but also harmful to the Company now or in the future if taken as 4 \naccurate or predictions rather than GIP’s scenario runs. 5 \n6 \nQ. Please explain what you mean , specifically,  by this additional material being 7 \nincorrect  or needing context ? 8 \nA. There are several issues of importance to the Company .

As part of any complex business transaction, scenario planning is an expected and 10 \nroutine part of the evaluation and due diligence process. The information contained in 11 \nHearing Exhibit OAG -412 was developed by GI P without the input of the Company 12 \nand reflected what GIP knew of Minnesota Power at the time of its creation in 2023. 13 \nGIP conducted an extensive due diligence  process that provided it with more 14 \ninformation about the Company’s strategies and Minnesota regulation in the time that 15 \nelapsed after the date of this presentation , and nonetheless disclosed early data even 16 \nthough it can be misconstrued by intervening parties.  The contents of GIP’s 2023 17 \ninternal scenario planning conducted  as a result of early evaluation processes does not 18 \nreflect GIP’s current view or Minnesota Power’s strategy today , as discussed in the 19 \nResponse Testimony of Witness Bram .  20 \n 21 \nIII.

Learn why this is important\nGood morning,\n I am writing in favor of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) andGlobal Infrastructure Partners (GIP) acquisition of ALLETE.  I was born and raised in northern Minnesota and have been an employee of Minnesota Powerfor nearly 15 years.  I believe this acquisition is in the best interest of ALLETE, employees, and customers.  Theacquisition by CPP Investments and GIP will provide financial backing and stability for ALLETEand its subsidiaries to continue to invest in clean energy to meet company, legislative, andsocietal goals to be carbon free and provide safe, reliable, least cost energy to our customers.  Without this acquisition, I do not believe ALLETE can achieve these goals, and I am in favor ofthe acquisition. \n \nThanks,Dan Daniel W.

E-015/PA-24-198\nLeave a comment on the docket. *\nAs a both a Minnesota Power customer and ALLETE employee for the past 10 years, I support the\nacquisition of ALLETE by CPP Investments and GIP. Both investment firms have clear track records ofinvesting in and supporting the development of both domestic and global sustainable energyinfrastructure projects. The financial support and expertise of these two firms will be extremelyvaluable to ALLETE and Minnesota Power for the challenging path ahead - to implement thecompany’s strategy and meet the state of Minnesota’s Carbon Free Standard. Developing generatingfacilities, acquiring assets, and procuring the energy necessary to meet these goals – all whilemaintaining competitiveness and ensuring a cost-effective product for customers, requiresconsistent financial support on a large scale. \nThe result of this transaction with CPP Investments and GIP will be a change in ownership, not a\nchange in strategy. Minnesota Power will continue to be an investor-owned public utility, locallymanaged, guided by its company values, and will continue to be regulated by the Minnesota PublicUtilities Commission. I appreciate that the company will remain in the communities we serve andcontinue to provide the same support to those communities as we always have. \nI’m excited for the future and appreciate the opportunity to voice my support for the acquisition. \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

E015/PA-24-198\nLeave a comment on the docket. *\nI urge you to support and approve the ALLETE acquisition. Though some fear what this acquisition\nmay mean, I fear what happens if it does not go through. Minnesota Power is a regulated utility, whodevelops an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which establishes the company strategy for the next 15years. The IRP starts with developing strategy which follows federal and state environmentalrequirements, analyzes numerous customer demand scenarios, and determines how to meet theseneeds in the lowest cost manner. This process has considerable stakeholder input and is ultimatelyapproved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC). The rates are reviewed and approvedby the MPUC and have a max return on equity. All capital and operating expenses are routinelyreviewed and approved by the MPUC through the Rate Review process. The transparency andoversight is robust. This regulated process does not change due to this acquisition. What theacquisition will do is ensure alignment between two investors to execute the plans established in theIRP. It establishes a commitment to these plans and is backed by companies who have the capital toinvest. These dollars are then spent in our local community, add to local tax base, and provide localjobs. This acquisition is a win for ALLETE, a win for employees, and most of all for all rate payingcustomers who will achieve the same outcomes at a lower overall cost. I urge decision makers tomake decisions based on fact and not on fear. Thank you for your consideration."

Learn why this is important\nGood afternoon,\nThis email is to remind the Commission that nothing good seems to ever come from the\nacquisition of any company by a hedge fund.  The target companies are loaded with debt andburdened with owners that have nothing in common with the industry or the people thecompany serves.  It seems that only profit and the hope for a \"cash out\" in the short term istheir motivation.\nWhile I am not a customer of Minnesota Power, I can sympathise with their ratepayers.  If this\ntakeover goes forward, they will be poorly served.\nThank you,Michael J. Scanlan\n____________________________Michael J.

Learn why this is important\nTo the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission:\nAttached in pdf form is my testimony in the docket E-015/PA-24-198, regarding the\nproposed acquisition of Allete.\nBuddy Robinson\n1506 N. Central Ave., Duluth, MN 55807\nTestimony to the MN Public Utilities Commission regarding the  Petition of Minnesota \nPower for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global \nInfrastructure Partners          Docket # E-015/PA-24-198\nBy:  Buddy Robinson, 1506 N. Central Ave., Duluth, MN  55807              April 14, 2025\n   I have been involved, as an advocate for residential customers, in all of MN Power's rate \ncases from 1980 to about 2015, in interventions by the Senior Citizen Coalition of NE MN/MN \nSenior Federation NE/Citizens Federation of NE MN, and as a witness for some interventions \nby the Energy CENTS Coalition.  Currently, I am a board member of the Citizens Utility Board \nof Minnesota, although I am submitting this testimony as a private citizen.\n   As a  Duluth citizen and a MN Power customer for over 40 years,I can assert that if the \nacquisition goes through, there will be a strong risk that my and all residential rates will go up, \nmore so than without the acquisition.  It is very disturbing that the testimony includes projected \nrate hikes, yet this is deemed “trade secret” and therefore the public cannot see it.  If they want\nto keep those future hikes secret from the public, that in itself says something very significant \nand troubling.\n   It's also probable that my City taxes and water rates will go up more so than otherwise, since\nDuluth uses a great deal of electricity for water pumping.\n   The proposed new owners of Allete are Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners – which is now owned by BlackRock, the world's largest asset \nmanager, with $11.5 trillion in assets.\n   Private equity companies are known for pursing high profit rates --- very possibly, higher \nprofit rates than what MN Power has usually sought.   Private equity companies have a pattern\nof extracting large profits for a while from their acquisitions and then selling them, often in 5 to \n10 years.  BlackRock will certainly want to recover from our rates the $400 million to $1.5 \nbillion they plan to pay above market value to buy Allete/MP, according to expert testimony.\n   Most people are unaware that in the utility regulation system, the profit that is taken in our \nrates is directly proportional to the dollar value of the generating, transmission, distribution, and\nother assets. In other words, you multiply the value of these assets times the allowed rate of \nreturn, and that gives you the total amount of profit they can take from us.  The higher the \nassets, the higher the total profit.  As a result, there is a clear incentive to build the most \nexpensive infrastructure possible, because it (almost) automatically translates into bigger \nprofits.   We residential households have to pay the cost, because we are what is known as \ncaptive customers.  This is especially important in the coming years if data centers, with \nenormous electricity needs, get built in MN Power's territory.  The desire to attract data centers\nis especially critical for MN Power, since it's largest customers – taconite mines and paper mills\n– are in a state of gradual decline.\n   In terms of clean energy, the incentive to make things as expensive as they are able to can \ntranslate into not wanting many customers to own their own sources of distributed electric \ngeneration or alternative, localized sources, since that means less generating capacity for MP \nto build and less expense for power lines, and therefore less profit.  It can lead to rejecting the \nmost cost effective mix of clean energy production and storage that is available, and extending\nthe use of expensive fossil fuel electric generation, and air-polluting burning of biomass.\n   It's also important to note that BlackRock has significant shares in three of  MN Power's  \nlargest customers: Cleveland Clliffs, US Steel, and Enbridge.  That creates an incentive to shift\ncosts from the rates of industrial customers onto everyone else.  This is a clear conflict of \ninterest, which by itself, should be enough to block the sale of Allete.\n   What happens if that shift takes place?  The industrial customers use three-quarters of MN \nPower's electricity.  The other one-quarter is used by all the other customers combined:  \nresidents, households, and municipalities like Duluth.   That's a three to one ratio.  So, to \nreduce industrial rates by 5%, you have to raise everyone else by 15%.   Reduce the industrial \nrate by 10%, raise the others by 30%.  Reduce the industrial rate by 20%, raise the others by \n60%, etc.\n                   \n   The more that BlackRock/CPPIB succeeds in raising the overall revenue requirement, the \ngreater the pressure will be to shift costs from the industrial class to other customers, \nespecially residential ratepayers.   The Large Power class is worried about their rates going up\nhigher than otherwise, and that's why the Large Power Intervenors formally oppose this \nacquisition.  If Large Power and Large Light & Power rates go up higher than they would \notherwise, this increases the incentive of the industrial customers to try to shift more of their \ncost to the other customers classes.\n    MN Power already says that the industrial customers pay more than their fair share, and so \nsome of their cost should be shifted onto us.  They say the industrial customers subsidize the \ncost for residential ratepayers.  But what does MN Power's own report to its stockholders say? \nIt says that in 2024, industrial customers paid $153.8 million for 1,780 megawatt-hours.  \nResidential customers paid $42.2 million for 276 megawatt-hours.  Do the math, and you see \nthat industrial customers pay, overall, 8.6 cents for each kilowatt-hour.  Residential customers \npay 15.3 cents – almost twice.  Does that look like they are subsidizing us?  Or is it the other \nway around?\n   The rate shift issue isn't new.  MN Power and the big industries have been pushing the \nbogus “subsidy” theory for over 40 years, which has never been fully accepted by the PUC.  \nIt's quite obvious that the taconite mines and paper mills have been the huge cost-causers for \nthe vast majority of MN Power's generating capacity.  MN Power's own hydroelectric power by \nitself – a very low cost energy source – generates enough power to supply almost all of the \nneeds of the residential class.\n    What is new however, if the acquisition goes through, is that MN Power's owners will have \ndeeper pockets than before to try to overwhelm the PUC with high priced experts and \nattorneys.   And if they lose at the PUC, they'll have deeper pockets than before to lobby the \nstate legislature to get what they want, which is a real danger.\n   MN Power says that it needs this acquisition to secure “reliable access to the equity capital \nrequired to fund the investments needed for the clean energy transition,” as Jennifer Cady \ntestified to the PUC.  If that's the case, then why does their new 15-year Integrated Resource \nPlan propose only 500 megawatts of clean energy and storage, yet 1,105 megawatts – 2.2  \ntimes as much -- in new fossil fuel electric generation?  That sounds like one step forward for \n“Energy Forward” and more than two steps back. \n   And, there are no guarantees that BlackRock, with its thousands of investments and all of \ntheir demands for capital, would choose to provide all the capital needed for MN Power.  For \nexample, they might choose to invest more heavily in utilities that have a better prospect than \nMN Power of landing data center customers.  It is possible that MN Power might do better if it \nwere to stick with its own publicly traded stock to raise new capital.\n    Some proponents of the proposed acquisition state their thanks for MN Power's track record\nup to now, including financial donations to local charities and benefits to local government \nentities.   In urging the PUC to approve the acquisition, they seem to be assuming that the \nsame decision process for these types of benefits will be in place.  However, that will not be \nthe case, since 100% of ownership of MN Power/Allete will be in the hands of BlackRock \n(60%) and CPPIB (40%).  These two entities will have control of 10 of the 13 Board of Director \nseats.\n   Previously, MN Power had very good reasons to act as a “good corporate citizen,” especially \nin regard to the City of Duluth.  BlackRock will have very little incentive to follow in that \ntradition.   BlackRock currently owns 13% of MN Power's stock.  Increasing it to a 60% \nownership stake is a drastically different situation, in terms of who really gets to make \ndecisions.\n   Unions are also in favor of the acquisition, since they seem to be getting guarantees to honor\ntheir current contracts.  But what guarantees will they have in the future beyond that?   \nConstruction unions also favor the acquisition.  Their self interest is naturally in decisions to \nbuild more generation, distribution and storage infrastructure.  However, there is no assurance \nthat more of that would happen under the new ownership compared to otherwise.   A  real risk \nis that BlackRock will seek to maximize short term profits – perhaps in part by paring down the \nworkforce and deferring maintenance, and then sell off a badly weakened utility.  If that \nhappens, it would further hurt the workers and unions along with ratepayers.  It would put \nMinnesota Power in a much worse status than it is in now.\n    In sum, there are no good reasons for the acquisition, and a host of reasons against it."

Learn why this is important\nI am a MN Power customer living in Duluth MN. I think the sale of MN Power to\ntwo private invest firms is a really bad idea. There is no guarantee those firms won’t\nturn around in 5 years & scrap all the union jobs and break up MNPower & sell it\noff to another business that may raise rates to a very high level. I live off my socialsecurity and that might make electrical payments difficult. I would rather see MN\nPower raise rates to make the change to clean energy if it has to. At least that would\nbe transparent. Then there is the issue of conflict of interest with Blackwater beingpart owner of some of the mines on the range that MN Power serves.

That’s why I\nfeel compelled to speak out against the proposed sale of ALLETE and Minnesota Power to Global\nInfrastructure Partners (GIP) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP), which would\nplace majority control under BlackRock. \nThis transaction raises serious red flags for future ratepayers like myself. Allowing private equity\nto take over a public utility means putting profit over people. We’ve seen what happens in places\nlike Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, where a similar buyout led to skyrocketing electricity rates.\nMinnesota Power’s customers shouldn’t be the next case study in what goes wrong when\nessential services are turned into investment vehicles. \nBeyond rates, I’m deeply concerned about the loss of transparency. If this acquisition goes\nthrough, ALLETE would no longer be publicly traded, making it harder for regulators and the\npublic to monitor decisions that impact us all. As someone who values community accountability\nand transparency, I do not want to see the energy future of northern Minnesota decided behind\nclosed doors. \nI’m also worried about the impact on Minnesota’s climate goals. We’re at a critical point in history\nwhere clean energy isn’t just a nice idea—it’s a necessity. Yet this buyout comes with no clear,enforceable commitments to meeting the 100% carbon-free by 2040 law. That’s unacceptable.\nMinnesota Power has not shown that it needs this acquisition to meet its goals. And private equity\nfirms like GIP are known for flipping their investments in just a few years, not sticking around to\nserve communities for the long haul. \nPlease deny the proposed acquisition . The risks are too high, and the benefits to the public are\nunclear at best. \nSincerely,\nJosh Fetcher\nFuture Duluth Resident | Moving in 2026Currently residing in FL\nmnpowercomms.csdc6@simplelogin.com\nPlease note: I am including my email for verification, but I respectfully ask that it not be made\npublic.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\n \nTo the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, My name is Scott Lyytinen and I have worked for Minnesota Power for almost 14 years.  I amvery proud to work for a company that has been so proactive with transitioning to greenenergy.  I love being able to have conversations with people and be able to tell them thatMinnesota Power was the first utility in Minnesota to hit 50% renewable.  I am proud to be ableto tell them that we have some of the lowest rates of investor owned utilities in the nation.  Iam proud to be able to tell them that when we had a terrible wind storm in 2016, that my co-workers and I spent 14-16 hours a day for a full week working to get our neighbors power backon.  I feel with new load growth projections, clean energy goals, and reliability goals, thatALLETE’s decision to seek a different path for ownership was needed.  It is needed to increaseour access to capital for all the work that we need to accomplish over the next years.  I amproud of my co-workers and all the work we do day to day.  We have a dedicated, energeticworkforce and I think we all see this opportunity as a great one, especially in these uncertaineconomic times.  I am in full support of this sale to GIP and CPP.

Learn why this is important\nDear Commissioners,\nMy name is Celeste Gutierrez, and while I am not yet a Minnesota Power ratepayer, I plan to\nmove to Duluth and build a life in the community served by Minnesota Power. That’s why I’m\ndeeply concerned about the proposed acquisition of ALLETE by Global Infrastructure Partners\n(GIP), a private equity firm recently acquired by BlackRock, and the Canada Pension Plan\nInvestment Board (CPP).\nThis transaction is not in the public interest , and I urge the Commission to deny the proposed\nacquisition  under Docket E-015/PA-24-198.\nThe risks this deal poses—to affordability, reliability, transparency, and the clean energy transition\n—are too great for Minnesota residents and communities to bear. Private equity ownership of a\npublic utility fundamentally alters its purpose: shifting from public service to shareholder returns.\nGIP’s own business model relies on short-term investments, cost-cutting, and maximizing profits.\nThese motives are incompatible with the long-term, community-centered service that Minnesotans\ndeserve.\nWe’ve seen what happens when private equity enters the utility space. In Michigan’s Upper\nPeninsula, a similar buyout led to some of the highest electric rates in the continental U.S. . In\nPittsburgh, a private-equity-owned utility failed its customers during a heatwave, providing limitedcommunication and unreliable service. In Kansas, a private equity firm made $215 million in\nprofits during a deadly winter storm, prompting lawsuits for alleged price gouging.\nThis is not a model Minnesota should replicate.\nHere are just a few of the major concerns I want to highlight:\nTransparency & Oversight Loss: Once ALLETE becomes private, it will no longer be\nsubject to SEC disclosures. The public and regulators will have far less visibility into\nfinancial decisions, conflicts of interest, or long-term plans.\nConflict of Interest Risks: BlackRock, which will effectively control Minnesota Power\nthrough GIP, holds major stakes in some of Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers\n—like U.S. Steel and Enbridge. These ties raise serious concerns about self-dealing, rate-\nsetting bias, and fairness to residential ratepayers.\nRatepayer Burden & Cost Increases:  The $6.2 billion acquisition price includes a large\npremium. CPP and GIP have provided no legally binding commitment to avoid passing\nthese costs onto ratepayers. In fact, history shows that private equity often increases rates\nto recoup such investments.\nCarbon-Free Transition Jeopardized:  Minnesota Power’s current resource plan includes\n1,100 MW of new fossil gas and no new solar—a step backwards from the state’s 2040\ncarbon-free goals. There are no guarantees that GIP and CPP will prioritize clean energy or\nstick to coal retirement timelines. Their track record offers no reason to believe they will.\nShort-Term Ownership & Local Instability:  GIP typically holds investments for just 5 to 7\nyears. There’s no assurance Minnesota Power will remain locally controlled. Headquartersin Duluth may only remain as long as it benefits GIP, not the community.\nAccess to Capital Is Not the Issue: ALLETE has not demonstrated difficulty accessing\ncapital on public markets. In fact, the MN Department of Commerce and the Attorney\nGeneral both found no evidence supporting the need for private equity funding. Claiming\ncapital access as the reason for this acquisition is unfounded and unsubstantiated.\nAs someone planning to move to Duluth—drawn by its community values, natural beauty, andcommitment to climate resilience—I want to be part of a future where our energy systems are\nequitable, clean, transparent, and locally accountable. This deal undermines that future.\nThe Public Utilities Commission has a duty to protect the public interest. That includes\nsafeguarding long-term service reliability, affordability, and transparency over short-term financial\ngains for outside investors. Please deny this acquisition and help keep Minnesota Power in\nservice of Minnesotans—not Wall Street.\nSincerely,\nCeleste Gutierrez\nFuture Duluth Resident | Planning to relocate in 2026\nCurrently residing in FLcelestek@pm.me\nPlease note: I am including my email as required, but I respectfully ask that it not be published\npublicly if possible.\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

I am concerned about a lack of transparency in the deal as far as what it will mean forrate payers. I am concerned about the proposed owners' commitment to clean energy:Under political pressure after President Trump’s election, BlackRock left a coalition aimed ataligning the asset management industry with global climate goals, causing the coalition tosuspend its activities. BlackRock’s GIP is opening an office in Qatar and investing in, amongother things, Abu Dhabi’s National Oil Company. BlackRock oversees an enormous amountof shares in fossil fuel companies and has a history of opposing climate-related shareholdermotions at these companies.  \nMaria Wardoku\nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

Learn why this is important\nTo Whom it May Concern,\nAs a Duluth resident I find it interesting that almost half of the public comments submitted todate (April 14) don't live in Minnesota Power's service territory. They aren't Minnesota Powercustomers and yet 120 of them are submitting form letters from national environmental groupsspreading misinformation and blatant lies about what is at stake for as a part of thisacquisition. How do they know who Minnesota Power is as a company? They just know whatthey have been told by groups sounding the alarm for things happening at the national levelthat have nothing to do with this deal.\nThis deal will allow Minnesota Power to continue to be regulated by the MN PUC. Will\ncontinue their philanthropic giving. Will keep their headquarters in Duluth and 1,100employees in northeastern Minnesota. It will also allow them to access capital that they can'tget from the stick market to comply with the carbon free mandates that the state has put uponMP and all of the other utilities in the state. \nI trust the leaders at Minnesota Power to know what is right for their company. They have\nmade decisions that have gotten them to exist for over 100 years. They clearly are doingsomething right. That's why I hope you recommend approval for this acquisition. We don'tneed voices from the Twin Cities speaking for Northern Minnesotans and Northern Minnesotabusinesses. That would never work if the roles were reversed.

E-015/PA-24-198\nLeave a comment on the docket. *\nLocal control of Minnesota Power is best for ratepayers and the climate.\nMy name is Eric Enberg, MD and I practice Family Medicine in West Duluth. Thank you for the\nopportunity to speak out on this important issue. \nI am very concerned that the proposed private equity buyout of Allete will be both bad for the\npoorest people in town - the working class people I serve every day, and for the climate. Here’s why:\nWhile we don’t know exactly how this deal is structured, private equity firms typically put up 50% of\nthe cash to buy a company but borrow the other half. It becomes the responsibility of the purchasedcompany to not only maintain and indeed increase their profit margin but to also pay off a crushingdebt load with interest. This is how the equity of the private equity firm instantly makes so muchreturn for its investors. Favorable tax laws such as the “carried interest” rule is the cherry on top. \nSo, who pays for all of this? Captive ratepayers are the major source of revenue. Given that 74% of\nthe electrons from Allete go to large industrial users such as mines and paper mills who claim to runnarrow margins, much of this demand for corporate profit and debt service will fall on theresidential and commercial customers, in other words, Duluth. The ratepayers are the narrowshoulders upon which this need for revenue will fall.\nThe need for increased profits and debt repayment will also be bad for the climate. Several of the\npurchasing entities have fossil fuel interests and nothing can be so efficiently rate based with a 10%rate of return than fossil fuel plants such as the proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center in Superior.While California is putting up so much solar and storage that they cut their natural gas usage by 25%just last year, and Texas is moving even faster, Minnesota Power/Allete again missed an opportunityto leapfrog over fossil fuels and into renewables with storage in its last Integrated Resource Plan.Make no mistake about it, the needless increase in electricity rates will tragically result in lessbeneficial electrification of home heating, and transportation. Indeed, our family has been amazed athow our cheap solar electricity has replaced gasoline and soon natural gas, benefits which will beless likely to the ratepayers if this merger goes through.\nThis buyout is a solution in search of a problem. Allete has no documented inability to secure\ncapital. Investors love utilities precisely because of their captive ratepayers. Rather, we have acurrent management team at Allete which seems highly motivated to see this deal go through. Don’tlet them and don’t let us ratepayers down. Keep Allete under the microscope of transparency as a\npublicly owned corporation.\nThank you,\nEric Enberg, MD \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

ALLETE, MN Power and SWL&P are huge for our communities,and their leadership is some of the best. They always lead with integrity and safety, that's how Iknow they are making a great decision. A little education piece for those who continue to bring uprate increases and how they will skyrocket: Rates will increase with or without the acquisition, ratesare determined by the PUC, not set by the utility company itself, going private doesn't dismiss thecompany from following the rules. I am excited for the opportunities that these new partners willbring to ALLETE and their subsidiary companies.

    "content": "I am a community member residing in Minnesota Power territory and a customer of over 25 \nyears.  \nI’m writing in strong support of the proposed acquisition of Alette by CPP and GIP . This transaction provides a clear and efficient path to meeting the state’s clean energy mandates —mandates set by the state itself, not the utility company. The proposal aligns \nwith long -term sustainability goals and embraces modern technologies that are more \nreliable than many realize. These innovations are crucial for co mpliance and necessary to \nmodernize our aging energy infrastructure.  \nTo form my opinion, I personally attended multiple in -person and virtual public hearings \nand listened to a wide range of perspectives. What became clear is that the most informed and experienced voices, especially those from labor, infrastructure, and busi ness \nsectors —overwhelmingly support this acquisition. There was a consistent and compelling \ncase made that this deal is not only necessary but strategic, forward-thinking, and rooted in real -world needs.  \nA key point raised at these hearings, and worth emphasizing is that rate increases are proposed by the utility and determined/approved by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), not by ALLETE or any potential new ownership. This oversight remains unchanged regardless of the sale. There is a common misconception that this transaction would \nautomatically lead to rate hikes, but in fact, the opposite is more likely true. Increasing \nrates are inevitable as time progresses to maintain the system and those costs c ontinually \nrise as time goes on. If the sale doesn’t proceed, higher rising rates are almost a certainty. \nThis acquisition brings in capital investment that supports keeping costs down and enables critical infrastructure improvements.  \nSome concerns have been raised about recent stock market volatility, but it’s important to \nnote that those events occurred after the acquisition announcement and have no bearing \non the fundamentals of the deal. Using market ﬂuctuations as a reason to oppo se this plan \ndistracts from its actual merits and long -term beneﬁts.  \nThis acquisition will position ALLETE to modernize its systems, improve reliability, and continue delivering affordable, stable service. A well -capitalized, ﬁnancially stable \ncompany is better equipped to make the long -term investments our energy grid nee ds. \nClaims that the sale would reduce infrastructure investment are not supported by facts; if \nanything, the reverse is true. \nWorkforce stability is another major reason to support this deal. The physical infrastructure \nand the people who maintain it remain essential, regardless of ownership. Multiple labor voices have emphasized that this transition supports job security and kee ps skilled union \nworkers in place, people who are vital to the day -to-day operation of the utility. This is not \nabout cutting jobs; it’s about strengthening the system and the workforce behind it.  \nIt’s also important to address misinformation that has been circulating. Some opponents \nhave made unfounded claims about foreign control, the end of public oversight, or the abandonment of renewable projects. These claims have been directly and repeatedly \ncorrected by experts, business leaders, and community members. The utility is not locally \nowned, and under the current proposal, it would remain under full regulatory oversight. Nothing about the deal removes the obligations or controls in place to ensure accountability and transparency.  \nOf course, no decision is without risk, but fear of the unknown is not a reason to avoid progress. This is a structured, transparent, and well -thought -out plan that positions us for a \nstable, resilient energy future. If this deal doesn’t go through, we fac e the very real \npossibility of a less favorable outcome, such as a hostile takeover, with far less local input or oversight.  \nThis acquisition is about moving forward. It’s about building a grid that can withstand future challenges, meet climate goals, keep rates manageable, and ensure that skilled union workers remain at the heart of the energy system. I urge decision -makers to support this \ntransition—for the future of our energy, our economy, and our communities.  \n \nEric Berube  \n1863 County Rd 4 \nCarlton, MN 55718"

Weathers Opposing Approval of ALLETE, Inc.’s Proposed Acquisition.pdf\nYou don't often get email from dnw_99@live.com. Learn why this is important\nGood afternoon,\nPlease find attached my comments on PUC Docket Number 24-198 . If possible, please\nconfirm receipt. Thank you, and have a great rest of your week.Kind regards,\nDawson N. Weathers\nBEFORE THE MINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION  \nCOMMENTS OF DAWSON N. WEATHERS OPPOSING APPROV AL OF ALLETE, \nINC.’S PROPOSED ACQUISITION  \nMPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \nTo: Chair and Commissioners of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission  \n \nI. Introduction  \nAs a concerned Minnesota citizen, I respectfully submit these comments in opposition to \nthe proposed acquisition of ALLETE, Inc. (the parent company of Minnesota Power) by private \nequity interests led by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP Investments”) and \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners (“GIP,” now part of BlackRock) . This $6.2 billion transaction \nwould transfer our region’s essential electric utility from a publicly traded company to a privately \nheld consortium. Under Minnesota law, the Commission may approve such an acquisition only if \nit finds the transaction is “consistent with the public interest.”1 As explained below, this proposal \nfails that legal standard. The record developed in this docket , including testimony from the \nMinnesota Department of Commerce, the Office of the Attorney General, consumer advocates, \nenvironmental justice organizations, and even Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers , \ndemonstrates significant risks to ratepayers, local communities, and Minnesota’s clean energy \ngoals, with no offsetting benefits that would satisfy the public interest requirement . I urge the \nCommission to deny approval of the acquisition.  \nII. The Public Interest Standard and Burden of Proo f \nMinnesota’s public -interest standard demands more than just benefits to ALLETE’s \nshareholders or the acquiring entities ; it requires real, tangible benefits to the public (especially \nthe utility’s customers) that outweigh all of the  harms . Under Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd.  1, the \nCommission must withhold consent unless  convinced that a proposed utility takeover is \n \n1 Minn. Stat. §  216B.50, subd.  1 (2024) (requiring Commission approval for a public utility acquisition and directing \nthat consent be given only if the transaction “is consistent with the public interest”) . In reaching a public -interest \ndetermination, the Commission must consider factors such as the reasonable value of the assets and the impacts on \nratepayers and service . \nconsistent with the public interest.2 The petitioners carry the burden of proving this consistency , \nyet in this case they have offered little more than speculative and unenforceable promises. As \nseveral parties have noted, the Commission cannot deem the acquisition to be in the public \ninterest merely because it may serve ALLETE’s business interests .3 Instead, the Commission \nmust consider the impacts on those who rely on Minnesota Power’s service , including \nhouseholds, small businesses, large industrial customers, and communities across northern \nMinnesota . \nThus far, the petitioners’ primary assertion is that having two large equity investors will \nimprove ALLETE’s access to capital for future investments (such as achieving Minnesota’s \n100% carbon -free by 2040 mandate).4 However, neither ALLETE nor its new owners have \nshown that ALLETE currently lacks access to capital, or that the private -equity ownership model \nwould materially improve financing beyond what is possible under continued public ownership. \nTo the contrary, as the Department of Commerce’s expert found, ALLETE may actually face a \nsmaller pool of available capital and new constraints if it becomes privately held , it would be \nreliant on two owners (GIP and CPP) who must also tend to their other investments, rather than \non the broader public markets that have long funded ALLETE’s needs.5 The Department \nconcluded that ALLETE’s claims of capital -access benefits are overstated, and that no \nmeaningful public -interest benefits have been demonstrated , only significant downsides, \nincluding the potential for higher costs to ratepayers.6 Simply put, the applicants have not met \n \n2 Id. \n3 Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota (CUB), Three Reasons We’re Worried about the Acquisition of Minnesota \nPower  (Mar. 3, 2025) (hereinafter “CUB Three Reasons”) (noting that the petitioners “have the burden to prove it is \nconsistent with the public interest” and that mere benefits to ALLETE and the buyers are insufficient) ; CUB, \nMinnesota PUC Decides on Procedure  (Sept. 26, 2024) (summarizing parties’ positions that public interest must \nencompass ratepayer interests, not just shareholders’ interests).  \n4 See Joint Petition of ALLETE, GIP, and CPP, MPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198, at 8 –10 (July 19, 2024) \n(asserting that private ownership by CPP/GIP will improve access to capital for Minnesota Power’s energy \ntransition) (summary reported by Citizens Utility Board) . But see  Minn. Dept. of Commerce, Direct Testimony of \nCraig Addonizio, MPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198, at 6 –9 (Feb.  1, 2025) (concluding ALLETE “overstates the \ndifficulty of raising capital as a public company” and that the acquisition is “not likely to result in meaningful public \ninterest benefits” and could instead raise costs for ratepayers) . \n5 Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP), Expert Testimony Submitted on Behalf of CURE  (Feb.  2025) (press \nrelease Mar. 12, 2025) (noting that after extensive review, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, the Office of \nAttorney General, CUB, Sierra Club, and Large Power Intervenors each filed testimony recommending that the \nCommission reject the acquisition as not in the public interest) . See also  Minn.  Dept. of Commerce, Addonizio \nDirect Testimony, supra  note 2, at 5 (the acquisition “could cause significant harm to the Company’s ratepayers by \ncausing rates to be higher than they would be absent the transaction”) . \n6 CUB Three Reasons , supra  note 3 (Potential Risks to Consumers), at 2 (explaining that the buyers’ $6.2  billion, \n$67/share offer is “much higher than what ALLETE was worth” before the deal, amounting to hundreds of millions \ntheir burden to show this acquisition would affirmatively benefit Minnesota’s public; instead, the \nevidence indicates it would put the public at risk.  \nIII. Risks to Ratepayers: Higher Costs, Higher Risks, and Reduced Service  \na. Control Premium and Rates.   \nA central concern is the large “control premium” being paid to ALLETE’s shareholders – \na premium that captive ratepayers will receive no share of yet  may ultimately foot the bill for. \nGIP and CPP have agreed to pay approximately $6.2 billion ($67 per share) for ALLETE, which \nis between $393 million and $1.5 billion above the company’s estimated value absent the \ntakeover .7 That windfall goes entirely to current shareholders. By contrast, ratepayers are being \noffered no comparable value or credit. In the typical utility acquisition, 100% of the control \npremium (the extra amount an acquirer pays to gain control ) flows to the target’s shareholders, \nwhile customers are left with at best token short -term concessions .8 Here, the buyers insist they \n“will not attempt to recover this premium from Minnesota Power customers.”9 Yet, \neconomically, the new owners must recoup that premium (with a profit) from somewhere , and \nMinnesota Power accounts for 81% of ALLETE’s revenue . It defies reason to believe the \nacquiring funds will simply absorb a near -billion -dollar premium without eventually pressuring \nthe utility’s earnings. Indeed, as observed in other merger cases, the premium reflects investors’ \nexpectation of extra returns beyond what regulation typically allows , through tactics like higher \nleverage or cutting costs , none of which bode well for ratepayers.10 If GIP/CPP cannot extract \n \nin acquisition premium. See also  CUB, Action Alert: Submit Comments (Apr.  2025) (hereinafter “CUB Action \nAlert”), at  2 (noting expert estimates of a $393  million to $1.5  billion premium above ALLETE’s standalone value, a \n“windfall for ALLETE shareholders that the buyers will expect to recoup, with profits”) . \n7 Scott Hempling, Inconsistent with the Public Interest: FERC’ s Three Decades of Deference to Electricity \nConsolidation , 39 Energy L.J. 233, 294 –95 (2018) (observing that in a typical utility merger, “100% of the control \npremium —the value the acquirer places on control —goes to the target company’s shareholders,” whereas the \ncustomer benefits offered are much smaller and often temporary) . In other words, shareholders reap a windfall \npayment (“control premium”) for selling, but ratepayers – who are the ones funding the utility’s revenues – receive \nat best token benefits that are dwarfed by the shareholder gain . Hempling argues that this disproportionality fails the \nregulatory principle that benefits should go to those who create the value . Here, ALLETE’s shareholders would \nreceive a substantial premium (approximately $67 per share, well above the pre -announcement market price) , while \nratepayers are promised little more than business -as-usual service.  \n8 Id. \n9 CUB Three Reasons, supra  note 3.  \n10 Scott Hempling, Inconsistent with the Public Interest: FERC’ s Three Decades of Deference to Electricity  \nConsolidation , 39 Energy L.J. 233, 294 –95 (2018)  \nthose returns (due to regulatory limits), the acquisition becomes a losing proposition for them, \ncreating perverse incentives to circumvent or undermine those limits.11 \nExperience warns that private equity owners “make back their investment” through \naggressive measures. For example, after Upper Peninsula Power Company (UPPCO) in \nMichigan was acquired by a private equity firm, that utility’s rates were increased repeatedly, and \nUPPCO’s residential customers now pay among the highest electricity rates in the region .12 \nMinnesota Power’s customers could face a similar trajectory of rising bills if GIP/BlackRock \nseek outsized returns. Even if direct rate increases are subject to Commission approval, there are \nother avenues to pass costs to customers , for instance, through higher authorized equity returns \n(via pressure to raise the allowed return on equity to attract capital) or by prioritizing capital \nprojects (which earn a regulated profit) over maintenance (which does not).13 The Commission’s \nregulatory oversight would be the main check on such efforts, but it could be tested and pushed \nby owners determined to maximize their ROI.  \nb. Leverage and Financial Risk.  \nPrivate equity buyouts are often highly leveraged, saddling the acquired company with \nnew debt. While the petitioners have not fully disclosed their financing plans, the Commission \nshould be wary of debt -loading strategies that could drive up the utility’s financing costs. The \nDepartment’s analysis flagged a “significant risk” that the acquisition will lead to a higher cost of \n \n11 CUB Three Reasons,  supra  note 3, at 2 (noting the buyers claim they will not seek to recover the premium from \ncustomers, but pointing out “they will, however, need to recover that premium from somewhere…Minnesota Power \nis ALLETE’s largest source of revenue,” making it likely the buyers’ efforts to earn a return will translate into \npressure for “significant rate increases” on Minnesota Power customers) . Even if the buyers do not explicitly file for \na surcharge to cover the acquisition cost, they could seek higher returns on equity in future rate cases or rely on more \naggressive capital spending (which increases rate base) to indirectly recoup their investment. The Department of \nCommerce has warned that the new owners’ need to compete for returns could increase the utility’s cost of capital \nand thus rates . \n12 Duluth News Tribune, Reader’ s View: Is Allete’ s Acquisition in the Public Interest?  (Mar. 22, 2025) (letter from \nLinda Herron) (describing how Upper Peninsula Power Co. in Michigan, after being acquired by a private equity \nfirm, imposed multiple rate increases and now has rates “three times” those of Minnesota Power) . See also  CURE, \nTake the Power Back (Apr. 3, 2025), at “Risks to ratepayers and residents”  (noting that UPPCO’s private equity \nowners have “been hiking rates ever since” the buyout, resulting in UP customers paying more than customers of \nsimilar utilities elsewhere) .  \n13 CUB Action Alert, supra  note 6, at 3 (explaining that if the Commission denies excessive rate increases that the \nnew owners want, the owners “may decide it is not in their interest to invest much more money in the company, to \nthe detriment of … service” quality for Minnesotans).  \ndebt and equity for Minnesota Power.14 Any uptick in financing costs will ultimately flow \nthrough to customer rates if not mitigated. Moreover, new owners might be tempted to have \nMinnesota Power guarantee or support debts of ALLETE’s other unregulated ventures, \nincreasing the utility’s exposure to those ventures’ risks. As Commerce witness Craig Addonizio \ntestified, the buyers could invest heavily in ALLETE’s riskier non -utility businesses, potentially \nundermining the utility’s financial health if those bets go bad.15 In a worst -case scenario, \nexcessive leverage or failed side investments could even jeopardize the utility’s solvency , a \ndisastrous outcome for captive ratepayers who rely on continuous service.16 \nc. Cuts to Service and Local Investment.  \nIf the new owners find that regulated rates and profits are not keeping up with their \nexpectations, they may respond by cutting costs in ways that harm service quality. Unlike \npublicly traded utilities, which are at least subject to market scrutiny and a broad shareholder \nbase, private equity owners have strong incentives to slash “expenses” that do not directly yield \nprofits. Unfortunately, those expenses often include critical operational areas like maintenance, \nreliability upgrades, customer service, and community programs . As CURE’s testimony \nobserved, regulated utilities earn a return on capital investments (like new power plants) but not \non operations and maintenance , meaning an owner fixated on high returns will see maintenance \n \n14 Star Tribune, Allete Meets Tough Hometown Crowd over Pending Sale  (J. Hollingsworth, Apr.  6, 2025) \n(summarizing testimony) (reporting that Commerce analyst Craig Addonizio testified the acquisition would create \n“significant risk” of higher debt financing costs, which would in turn drive up Minnesota Power’s rates, even as \nALLETE maintains the sale won’t affect rates). Id. (Addonizio also testified that under private ownership ALLETE \n“will have to compete with other investments owned by GIP and CPP” for capital and will have access to a smaller \npool of investors than it has as a public company).  \n15 Star Tribune, Allete Meets Tough Hometown Crowd, supra , at 2 (Addonizio testimony) (warning that new owners \ncould invest heavily in ALLETE’s other, unregulated and “riskier” businesses, potentially “magnify[ing] the risk \nof… financial problems or even bankruptcy” if those ventures falter, since losses could ultimately affect the overall \ncorporate parent’s health). ALLETE owns various non -utility subsidiaries, and petitioners have not ruled out \nexpanding those; if such expansion is debt -funded or unsuccessful, it could put pressure on Minnesota Power’s \nfinances. See also  CURE, Take the Power Back, supra , at “Debt”  (explaining that private equity owners often \nleverage acquired companies with new debt to extract cash, at the risk of making the company less creditworthy or \neven bankrupting it if taken too far).  \n16 Star Tribune, Allete Meets Tough Hometown Crowd, supra , at 3 (noting research that GIP typically holds \ninvestments for less than a decade, making it very likely Minnesota Power would be re -sold in the near future, and \nquoting a local shareholder’s concern that there is a “very good chance” the utility would be sold again in a few \nyears, jeopardizing Duluth’s stake in having a headquarters) . GIP’s own leadership acknowledges this short horizon: \nsee CUB Action Alert, supra  note 6, at ¶  4 (quoting GIP’s chairman: “We are quite opportunistic sellers…we are a \nfinite -life fund – everything we own is for sale”) . Five to ten years might be “long -term” from a private fund’s \nperspective, but as CUB notes , utility obligations span decades, and having the company on the auction block again \nso soon would be highly disruptive . \nand customer service as costs to minimize.17 Deterioration in service reliability and outage \nresponse, or delays in upkeep of infrastructure, would especially hurt rural and low -income \ncommunities that can least afford alternatives. Such outcomes raise serious environmental justice \nconcerns, as vulnerable populations disproportionately suffer from unreliable or unaffordable \nutility service. Minnesota Power has long prided itself on near -best-in-state reliability and low \nresidential bills ; those public interest achievements could be eroded under an aggressive cost -\ncutting regime.  \nIV. Governance and Oversight Concerns: Short -Term Ownership, Transparency, and \nAccountability  \na. Short Investment Horizon & Enforceability of Commitments.   \nThe proposed buyers are private investment funds with finite lifespans,  not traditional \nlong-term utility owners. GIP’s chairman has frankly stated that they are “opportunistic sellers” \nand that “everything we own is for sale” once  the investment team decides it’s time to exit .18 \nGIP’s typical holding period for investments is reportedly under 10 years .19 This raises a strong \nprobability that Minnesota Power could be sold again in a few years,  churning ownership and \nthrowing the utility’s direction into flux . Even if the present acquisition were somehow found to \nconfer slight benefits, those could be fleeting , and the Commission (and the public) might have \nto go through another resource -intensive review for the next sale on the heels of this one . The \npossibility of a quick resale also undermines any promises made by the current buyers: \ncommitments about local presence or future investments could be mooted by the next owner, \nwho would not be bound by informal assurances made today.  \nOn that point , the petitioners have offered only short -term, non -enforceable \ncommitments. For example, they pledged no immediate layoffs and to keep employee pay and \nbenefits the same, but only for two years after closing.20 They likewise said the headquarters will \nremain in Duluth, but did not guarantee how long . Such promises, limited in scope and duration, \nprovide little comfort to workers and communities. After two years, the new owners would be \nfree to downsize staff or relocate operations , moves that could particularly impact northern \n \n17 See CURE, Take the Power Back, supra.  \n18 CUB Action Alert, supra  note 6, at ¶  4. \n19 Star Tribune, Allete  Meets Tough Hometown Crowd over Pending Sale  (J. Hollingsworth, Apr.  6, 2025).  \n20 Id. \nMinnesota’s economy and undermine service quality. More critically, these commitments are not \nenshrined as binding conditions in any regulatory approval (at least as the deal currently stands). \nThey are essentially public -relations assurances. The Coalition of Utility Cities and labor \nintervenors have rightly noted that even pro -union statements from the buyers have been tepid \nand lack firm guarantees beyond the short term .21 In the absence of enforceable conditions in a \nCommission order, the Commission’s ability to hold the companies to their word is limited. The \npublic interest is not served by a deal that relies on trust in private equity promises rather than \nlegally enforceable protections.  \nFurthermore, if the new owners become dissatisfied  (say the Commission rejects a rate \nincrease or insists on cost disallowances ) they could decide to under -invest in the utility or flip it \nto another buyer, leaving Minnesota Power in limbo. As the Large Power Intervenors’ expert put \nit, this scenario would leave regulators and consumers “between a rock and a hard place”: either \naccept unsustainably large rate increases to satisfy the owners’ profit goals, or face the turmoil of \nan attempted sale of the utility to whoever will take it.22 Such instability is precisely what utility \nregulation is designed to avoid. It contradicts the “public interest” to subject a critical utility to a \nrevolving door of profit -seeking owners with short horizons. By contrast, Minnesota’s tradition \nof utility oversight has favored long -term planning, stakeholder input (through IRPs, rate cases, \netc.), and continuit y, all of which would be strained by rapid ownership turnover.  \nb. Transparency and Reporting.  \nA shift from public to private ownership would significantly reduce the transparency of \nMinnesota Power’s operations and finances. As a publicly traded company, ALLETE is currently \nsubject to SEC reporting, investor disclosures, and broad scrutiny by analysts and shareholders. \nA privately held ALLETE would face no SEC reporting requirements, and information about its \nfinancial condition and strategy would largely disappear from public view . The Commission and \nstakeholders would be left with only the data provided through regulatory filings, which , while \nsignificant , may not capture the full picture as comprehensively as public filings do. The \n \n21 CUB Three Reasons, supra  note 3.  \n22 Initial Comment of Large Power Intervenors at 1 –8, In re Minn. Power for Approval of the Acquisition of \nALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Inv. Bd. & Glob. Infrastructure Partners, MPUC Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 \n(Aug. 19, 2024), \nhttps://www.edockets.state.mn.us/EFiling/edockets/searchDocuments.do?method=showPoup&documentId=%7B90\nB01C5C -0000 -CF14 -A027 -0F422DD0B89A%7D&documentTitle=20258 -215860 -01. \nDepartment of Commerce specifically warned that taking ALLETE private would “reduce \ntransparency” because the company would no longer be subject to public disclosure rules .23 \nPrivate equity firms are notoriously secretive; their investors demand confidentiality, and they \nare adept at structuring transactions in complex ways that can obscure true economics. This \nculture clashes with the ethos of a public utility, which should be accountable to the public.  \nAlarmingly, even during this review process , Minnesota Power and its prospective \nowners have withheld important information from public scrutiny. Large portions of their filings \n– including details of their future business plans and even projections of future rate increases  – \nhave been marked “Trade Secret,” accessible only to parties under non -disclosure agreements . In \nsome instances, critical information was redacted as “privileged” without following proper \nprocedures, prompting objections from the Attorney General’s Office and others .24 The \nAdministrative Law Judge has already had to intervene, ordering the petitioners to disclose some \nof the improperly hidden information.25 Such behavior sets a bad tone for how the companies \nwould engage with regulators and the public in the future. If GIP and BlackRock are reluctant to \nshare information now, when they seek approval and must curry public favor, one can only \nimagine their opacity once the deal is done . Diminished transparency would weaken regulatory \noversight, as the Commission might have to expend more effort (through audits, data requests, \nand enforcement actions) just to get basic information that is today available as a matter of \ncourse. This is a step backward in utility accountability.  \nc. Conflicts of Interest and Corporate Complexity.  \nThe entry of BlackRock (the world’s largest asset manager) via its ownership of GIP \nintroduces an unprecedented web of potential conflicts of interest . BlackRock and GIP \ncollectively hold stakes in a n indescribably  vast array of companies , including companies that \nare customers of Minnesota Power, suppliers to the utility, or competitors in some respects . For \n \n23 Star Tribune, Allete Meets Tough Hometown Crowd over Pending Sale  (J. Hollingsworth, Apr.  6, 2025).  \n24 CUB Action Alert, supra note 6, at ¶  6 (noting that Minnesota Power’s rate increase forecast in future years was \nfiled under seal, viewable only under NDAs, and that the companies even withheld some information from \nintervenors and the ALJ by claiming privilege without proper procedure) ; CURE, Take the Power Back, supra, at \n“Lack of transparency and accountability”  (stating that “several parties have raised concerns about this lack of \ntransparency” and the ALJ has already ordered the companies to disclose some hidden info, with the OAG seeking \nmore via motion) . Such actions early in the process suggest a pattern of secrecy that bodes ill for open dealings post -\nacquisition. The Commission should be concerned that it had to compel basic information , for example, data on how \nthe acquisition might affect rates , that normally would be front and center in a public -interest evaluation.  \n25 Id. \nexample, BlackRock -managed funds own significant shares in major industrial corporations and \nenergy companies.26 If BlackRock (indirectly) controls 60% of ALLETE, it could find itself on \nboth sides of transactions – e.g., if a BlackRock -affiliated mine negotiates an electricity contract \nwith Minnesota Power. Minnesota law does have an affiliated interest statute that requires \nCommission approval of contracts between a utility and entities under common ownership or \ncontrol. However, with an owner as expansive as BlackRock, the boundaries of “affiliated \ninterest” become difficult to even identify. The sheer size and breadth of BlackRock/GIP mean \nthat Minnesota Power’s required affiliated interest filings could become extraordinarily complex , \nessentially trying to catalog dealings across a global portfolio. The Department likewise \nhighlighted the risk of self -dealing and preferential arrangements favoring the owners’ other \nbusiness interests, to the detriment of ratepayers.27 \nWhile the applicants insist they will respect affiliate transaction rules and maintain \ntransparency , it is small comfort given their aggressive confidentiality assertions and the \nincentives at play. Effective regulatory oversight of such a complex ownership structure would \nrequire significant ongoing resources , essentially forcing the Commission to become a watchdog \nover a private equity portfolio. The public should not bear the risk that subtle forms of self -\ndealing (such as directing utility procurement to favored vendors, or offering special power rates \nto certain large customers tied to the owners) could slip through. Moreover, if problems do arise \n(for instance, disputes over whether an affiliate transaction was arm’s -length), they could be \nharder to remedy when the ultimate owners and decision -makers are outside the traditional utility \nmanagement chain and possibly outside the Commission’s direct jurisdiction. In sum, the \nacquisition would complicate or weaken oversight just as it increases the need for vigilant \noversight – a paradox not in the public interest.  \n \n26 CUB Three Reasons, supra note 3, at 3 (noting both CPP and GIP/BlackRock hold significant interests in \ncompanies that do business with Minnesota Power or in adjacent industries, creating “potential conflicts of interest” \nwhere the owners could be motivated to make decisions favoring their other investments in ways that “harm or \nincrease costs for Minnesota Power and its customers”) . The example given is apt: if an owner holds a stake in a \nlarge electricity user (say a data center or mine), it might push Minnesota Power to give that affiliate preferential \ntreatment. Minnesota’s affiliated interest law, Minn. Stat. §  216B.48, subd.  3, does require Commission approval of \ncontracts with affiliated interests, broadly defined . However, monitoring and enforcing such provisions become \nmore challenging when the “affiliation” arises not from a simple corporate parent -subsidiary relationship but \nthrough a sprawling investment portfolio like BlackRock’s with indirect control. The Department explicitly \nhighlighted the risk of self -dealing due to BlackRock’s large ownership stakes in many companies, calling the \npotential for intra -portfolio conflicts a reason the acquisition could be against the public interest.  \n27 Star Tribune, Allete Meets Tough Hometown Crowd over Pending Sale  (J. Hollingsworth, Apr.  6, 2025).  \nIt is also worth noting questions raised about the character and integrity of the acquiring \nentities. During this proceeding, evidence emerged linking GIP’s leadership to troubling conduct \nin another company: SunPower Corporation, a solar firm in which GIP holds a major stake , faced \nan accounting scandal and SEC investigation after its independent auditor resigned over alleged \nfinancial misconduct. A senior GIP executive (who is a witness in this docket) sat on SunPower’s \nboard and has been named in lawsuits concerning that company’s misstatements. In rebuttal \ntestimony, that GIP executive offered little explanation or assurance regarding these issues.28 \nThis history gives pause about entrusting our public utility to this management. While tangential, \nit underscores a pattern: the private equity model often prioritizes aggressive growth and \nfinancial engineering, sometimes at the expense of transparency and ethics. Minnesota’s \nratepayers deserve an owner whose commitment to the public service ethos of a utility is beyond \nreproach. Here, there is legitimate doubt on that front.  \nV. Implications for Minnesota’s Clean Energy and Environmental Justice Goals  \nThis proposed acquisition also threatens to derail or delay Minnesota’s progress on clean \nenergy and to undermine environmental justice commitments. Minnesota law now requires \nelectric utilities to supply 100% carbon -free electricity by 2040  – an ambitious goal that will \ndemand steady investment in renewable energy, grid modernization, and transition plans for \nlegacy fossil assets. The Commission must consider whether the new owners would help or \nhinder these efforts. Petitioners argue that by providing “patient capital,” GIP and CPP will \naccelerate Minnesota Power’s transition to cleaner energy. However, their track record and \nincentives suggest otherwise .29 As noted, GIP/BlackRock seek high returns over relatively short \nhorizons. Large, transformative clean -energy investments (like wind farms, solar arrays, or \ntransmission expansions) often have payback periods measured in decades and require consistent \npolicy support. If the new owners do not see quick profit in such projects, they may be less \nenthusiastic to pursue them aggressively – or might favor continued operation of carbon -\n \n28 CUB Action Alert, supra note 6.  \n29 CURE, Take the Power Back, supra , at “Puts Minnesota’ s critical clean energy goals in the hands of private \ninvestors”  (arguing that turning Minnesota Power over to CPP/GIP/BlackRock “risks slowing down Minnesota’s \nclimate action”, noting that Minnesota Power’s latest plans include new natural gas generation and that \nBlackRock/GIP’s fossil fuel ties undermine their “purported clean energy focus.” The Commission should weigh \nwhether the transaction would make it harder to hold the utility to its climate obligations. A privately held Minnesota \nPower might be less responsive to public and political pressure on climate issues, since it will no longer face annual \nshareholder meetings or the same level of public scrutiny on ESG (environmental, social, governance) performance.  \nintensive assets to maximize short -term cash flow. In fact, Minnesota Power’s recent Integrated \nResource Plan filing (coming after  the acquisition announcement) raised eyebrows: the utility \nsignaled interest in adding 1,100  MW of new natural gas generation and stepped back from prior \ncommitments to fully retire coal plants without fossil replacements .30 This apparent pivot away \nfrom a faster coal -to-clean transition is troubling. It could indicate that anticipation of new profit -\ndriven ownership is already tilting Minnesota Power’s strategy toward fossil -fuel investments \nthat guarantee returns, i nstead of prioritizing cheaper renewables and energy efficiency which \nbenefit consumers and the climate.  \nTo be clear, the public interest standard encompasses more than just rates . It also includes \nservice quality, reliability, and alignment with state policy objectives such as environmental \nprotection and equity. Here, nearly every facet of the public interest could be adversely affected: \nhigher bills, worse service, less accountability, and a utility less responsive to Minnesota’s clean \nenergy vision.31 \nVI. Conclusion: The Transaction is Not Consistent with the Public Interest  \nAfter careful review of the evidence and arguments, the conclusion is inescapable: this \nprivate -equity buyout fails the public interest test of Minn. Stat. §  216B.50. The deal provides a \nsubstantial windfall to ALLETE’s shareholders and the acquiring investors, but imposes \nsignificant risks on Minnesota ratepayers and communities  without offsetting benefits. The \nCommission’s mandate is to safeguard the public interest, not to bless Wall Street transactions \nthat place Minnesota’s energy future in the hands of distant investors with divergent goals. \nIndeed, the opposition to this acquisition spans the spectrum of stakeholders from state agencies \ncharged with consumer and environmental protection, to industrial power customers concerned \nabout cost and stability, to advocacy groups for low -income and rural communities. This broad \n \n30 Id. \n31 Public Hearing Tr., Duluth, MN (Apr.  7, 2025, 6  pm) (comments of Linda Herron and Councilor Wendy \nDurrwachter) (community members raised concerns that a private equity firm’s goal to “increase revenues and \ndecrease expenditures” conflicts with providing affordable, reliable, and clean power, and noted “a lot of alarms go \noff” at the idea of a profit -driven firm owning the utility)  . Numerous members of the public have submitted \ncomments echoing these fears – that a private, profit -maximizing owner will not prioritize Minnesota consumers or \nstate policy goals. Public input is a factor the Commission may consider, especially as it reflects the on -the-ground \nperspective of those who will live with the consequences. Here, public sentiment has been strongly skeptical of the \nacquisition’s merits.  \nconsensus underscores that Minnesotans see little upside and unacceptable downside  in the \nproposed sale.  \nThe Commission should give great weight to the warnings of its expert agencies. The \nDepartment of Commerce flatly concluded that taking ALLETE private is unlikely to yield \nmeaningful benefits and could cause harm in the form of higher rates. The Office of the Attorney \nGeneral has been active in pressing for transparency and scrutinizing the deal’s claims, reflecting \nskepticism that the transaction serves the public. Even Minnesota Power’s largest industrial \ncustomers , who might be presumed to favor corporate flexibility , have opposed the acquisition, \nwith their consultant testifying it would lead to “unsustainably large rate increases” and loss of \ncontrol over the utility’s direction .32 When normally divergent interests (residential consumers, \nbig industry, environmental advocates, labor, and government experts) all line up against a \nproposal, it speaks volumes. The only substantial support has come from the petitioners and \ncertain labor groups, the latter of whom support it conditiona lly on hoped -for commitments to \njobs, commitments that, as discussed, are limited and unenforceable, and in some cases have not \nbeen solidified. Tepid or conditional support cannot overcome the affirmative evidence of likely \nharm.  \nIn sum, approving this acquisition would transfer a vital public service to an \nownership structure ill -suited to uphold the public interest . The deal carries too many red \nflags: a huge diversion of value to shareholders at customer expense, heightened financial and \noperational risks, diminished regulatory insight, and misalignment with Minnesota’s policy \npriorities. Minnesota law does not compel the Commission to approve such a transaction, and in \nfact empowers it to reject proposals that do not affirmatively satisfy the public interest standard. \nThis is a textbook case for denial.  \nFor these reasons, I urge the Commission to find that the proposed acquisition of \nALLETE by GIP/BlackRock and CPP is not consistent with the public interest and to deny \nconsent for the transaction. By doing so, the Commission will protect Minnesota ratepayers from \nunwarranted risks, preserve accountability for our public utility, and send a clear message that \nour state will not compromise the public interest for private gain. Minnesota Power can and \nshould continue to pursue the capital and innovation needed for our clean energy future without \n \n32 Star Tribune, Allete Meets Tough Hometown Crowd over Pending Sale (J. Hollingsworth, Apr. 6, 2025).  \nsacrificing local transparency, regulatory oversight, and consumer protections. The public \ninterest is best served by keeping Minnesota Power’s obligations firmly anchored in Minnesota, \nunder owners and a corporate structure that put the public good, not private equity profits, first.  \nRespectfully submitted,  \nDawson N. Weathers  \nDated: April  16, 2025"
