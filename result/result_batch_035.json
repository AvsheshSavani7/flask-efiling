FPA section 203(a)(4) requires the Commission to approve proposed dispositions, \nconsolidations, acquisitions, or changes in control if the Commission  determines that the \nproposed transaction will be consistent with the public interest.43  The Commission’s \nanalysis of whether a  proposed transaction is consistent with the public interest generally \ninvolves consideration of three factors:  (1) the effect on competition; (2) the effect on \nrates; and (3) the effect on regulation.44  FPA section 203(a)(4) also requires the \nCommission to find that the proposed transaction “will not result in cross -subsidization of \na non -utility associate company or the pledge or encumbrance of utility assets for the \nbenefit of an associate company, unless the Commission determines that the cross -\nsubsidization, pledge, or encumbrance will be consistent with the public interest.”45  The \nCommission’s regulations establish verification and informational requirements for entities that seek a determination that a proposed transaction will not result in \ninappropriate cross -subsidization or pledge or encumbrance of utility assets.\n46 \n2. Analysis of the Proposed Transaction  \na. Effect on Horizontal Competition   \ni. Applicants’ Analysis  \n30. Applicants  represent that the Proposed  Transaction will have no adverse effects on \nhorizontal competition.  Applicants state that when a transaction will result in a de \nminimis combined generation market share in a relevant market, the transaction does not \nraise  horizontal market power concerns and does not require further horizontal market \npower analyses.47  Applicants identify five  relevant geographic markets  in which they \n \n43 16 U.S.C. § 824b(a)(4).  Approval of the Proposed Transaction is also required \nby other regulatory agencies pursuant to their respective statutory authorities before the Proposed Transaction may be consummated.  See  Application at 55- 56.  Our findings \nunder FPA section 203 do not affect those agencies’ evaluation of the Proposed \nTransaction pursuant to their respective statutory authorities.  \n44 Merger Policy Statement , FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 31,044 at 30,111.  \n45 16 U.S.C. § 824b(a)(4). \n46 18 C.F.R. § 33.2(j) (2024) . \n47 Application at 44 . \nDocket No. EC24- 105-000 - 15 - \nown generation capacity:  MISO, SPP , and PJM markets , and the Bonneville  and \nNorth Western  balancing authority areas.  The bulk of ALLETE’s generating resources \nare located in MISO , and  ALLETE owns two generating resources in SPP and a single \nresource in each of the Bonneville  and North Western  balancing authorities and PJM.  \nApplicant s explain further that affiliates of Buyer own generation in the MISO, SPP, and \nPJM markets  and the NorthWestern balancing authority area, and that therefore these are \nthe four overlapping relevant geographic markets  in which both ALLETE and Buyer own \ngeneration .48 \n31. According to Applicants, the combined amount of generation capacity that will be \naffiliated  with ALLETE  following consummation of the Proposed Transaction , after \ntaking into account long -term contracts, will be no more than 2.2 % of the total installed \ngeneration capacity in any of the four relevant markets.  Specifically, Applicants state \nthat in  MISO , where the bulk of ALLETE’s generation is located, the combined \ngeneration  capacity  of ALLETE and Buyer will represent only 2.4 % of the total MISO \ngeneration  capacity , and only 2.2 % of uncommitted capacity.  In PJM, the combined \ncapacity  will represent  2.4% of PJM capacity  overall, and 2.1 % of uncommitted capacity .  \nIn SPP, the combined capacity  is 2% of SPP overall  capacity , and less than 1 % of \nuncommitted capacity.  Applicants further explain that i n North Western , all generation \ncapacity owned by ALLETE and Buyers is fully committed under long- term contracts , \nand that accordingly, the uncommitted capacity in NorthWestern  is 0% of the total \nNorthwestern  balancing authority area .49 \nii. Commission Determination  \n32. In analyzing whether a proposed transaction will adversely affect horizontal \ncompetition, the Commission examines the effects on concentration in the generation \nmarkets  and whether the  proposed transaction otherwise creates the  incentive and ability \nto engage in behavior harmful to competition, such as withholding of generation.50 \n33. Based on Applicants’ representations, we find that the Proposed Transaction will \nnot have an adverse effect on horizontal competition.  Under section 33.3(a)(2) of the \nCommission’s regulations, applicants seeking authorization under FPA section 203 are not required to submit a horizontal market power analysis where the combining “entities do not currently conduct business in the same geographic markets or ... the extent of the business transactions in the same geographic markets is de minimis ” and “no intervenor \nhas alleged that one of the merging entities is a perceived potential competitor in the \n \n48 Id. at 43 . \n49 Id. \n50 Nev.

Effect on Vertical Competition  \ni. Applicants’ Analysis  \n34. Applicants assert that the Proposed Transaction does not raise vertical market \npower concerns .  Applicants state that in analyzing whether a Proposed Transaction \npresents vertical market power concerns, the Commission will consider whether the \ncombination of generation assets with inputs to generation or power sales (such as natural \ngas, transmission , or fuel) could increase the merged company’s ability and/or incentive \nto raise prices in wholesale electric markets.53  Applicants state that while the Propos ed \nTransaction will result in a combination of electric generation assets and electric transmission, fuel supply , and fuel distribution systems, this common ownership does not \nraise any vertical market power concerns because all of ALLETE’s transmission facilities, other than limited and discrete interconnection facilities necessary to connect \nindividual generation facilities to the transmission grid, are under the operational control of MISO.  Applicants assert that the Commission consistently has ruled that transmission \nfacilities cannot be used to exercise vertical market power when control of those transmission facilities has been transferred to an independent entity, such as a regional \ntransmission organization .\n54 \n35. Applicants further state that affiliated entities of Global Infrastructure \nManagement and Canadian Pension Plan Investments either own only limited and \ndiscrete interconnection facilities necessary to connect individual electric generation facilities to the transmission grid or transmission facilities that have received waiver of \n \n51 18 C.F.R. § 33.3(a)(2) (2024) . \n52 See Panda Stonewall LLC, 177 FERC ¶ 61,048, at P 23 (2021) (finding that \noverlapping generation capacity in the relevant geographic markets with market shares of 2.05% and 2.81% was de minimis , and the proposed transaction did not require a \nhorizontal competitive analysis).   \n53 Application at 44 (citing N.

Applicants assert that the Proposed Transaction does not involve any inputs to \nelectricity products that would allow Applicants or their affiliates to raise  wholesale \nelectricity prices or to erect barriers to entry to new generation.  Applicants represent that \nColumbia Gas’s facilities also cannot be used to erect barriers to entry, because such facilities are operated on an open access basis pursuant to the  requirements set forth in \npart 284 of the Commission’s regulations,\n57 and MISO and PJM (and NYISO) are served \nby multiple other interstate natural gas pipelines and storage providers not affiliated with \nGlobal Infrastructure Management .  Applicants further state that the Commission has \nadopted a rebuttable presumption that ownership or control of such  inputs does not allow \na seller to erect barriers to entry, and there is no basis to find the presumption to be \novercome in this case.58 \nii. Commission Determination  \n37. In analyzing whether a proposed transaction presents vertical market power \nconcerns, the Commission considers the vertical combination of upstream inputs, such as transmission or natural gas, with downstream generating capacity.  As the Commission has previously found, transactions that combine electric generation assets with inputs to \ngenerating power (such as natural gas, transmission, or fuel) can harm competition if the \ntransaction increases an entity’s ability or incentive to exercise vertical market power in wholesale electricity markets.  For example, by denying rival entities access to input s or \nby raising their input costs, an entity created by a transaction could impede entry of new competitors or inhibit existing competitors’ ability to undercut an attempted price increase in the downstream wholesale electricity market.\n59  \n \n55 Id. at 23 n.71, 30 n.91 , 45. \n56 Id. at 45.  \n57 18 C.F.R. pt. 284  (2024) . \n58 Application at 45 -46 (citing Mkt .-Based Rates for Wholesale Sales of Elec . \nEnergy,  Capacity & Ancillary Servs . by Pub.

Based on Applicants’ representations, w e find that the Proposed Transaction will \nnot have an adverse effect on vertical competition.  As Applicants explain, all of \nALLETE’s transmission facilities  are under the operational control of MISO, and \naffiliated entities of Global Infrastructure Management and Canadian Pension Plan \nInvestments either own only limited and discrete interconnection facilities necessary to \nconnect individual generation facilities to the transmission grid or transmission facilities that have received waiver of the obligation to provide an OATT.\n60   \n39. Applicants  have demonstrated that the Proposed Transaction does not involve any \ninputs to electricity products that would allow Applicants or their affiliates to raise wholesale electricity prices or to erect barriers to entry to new generation.\n61  Applicants \nstate that, while Global Infrastructure Management and Canadian Pension Plan \nInvestments are affiliated with Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas  entities that own and \noperate interstate natural gas facilities in MISO and PJM, as we conclude above, \nApplicants’ business transactions in those markets is de minimis .62  In addition, no \nintervenor has alleged that one of the merging entities is a perceived potential competitor \nin the same geographic market as the other.63  Accordingly, we find that there will be no \nnew combination or affiliation of vertical assets that would raise a vertical competition issue.  \nc. Effect on Rates  \ni. Applicants’ Analysis  \n40. Applicants represent that the Proposed Transaction will not have an adverse effect \non rates.  Applicants explain that the Proposed Transaction will substitute a group of \nshareholders with alternative investors but will have no effect on ALLETE’s utility \noperations.  Applicants state that upon consummation of the Proposed Transaction, \nALLETE will not have service contracts with, or be allocated any overhead costs from, Buyer or any of its upstream owners.

Applicants make a hold harmless commitment to ensure that their transmission  or \ncost-based wholesale power rates will not be affected by the Proposed Transaction.  More specifically, ALLETE commits, for a period of five  years following consummation of the \nProposed Transaction, to hold harmless  its transmission and cost- based wholesale power \ncustomers from Proposed Transaction -related  costs  and will not include any Proposed \nTransaction -related costs in its jurisdictional cost- based rates.  Applicants explain that \nALLETE’s Proposed Transaction -related costs are defined to include both external costs \n(such as  outside advisors  and attorneys’ fees) and internal costs including labor and  other \nexpense items attributable to the Proposed Transaction  as well as any transition costs.\n65 \nii. Commission Determination  \n42. Based on Applicants’ representations, we find that the Proposed Transaction wi ll \nnot have an adverse effect on rates.  As Applicants  note, upon consummation  of the \nProposed Transaction , ALLETE will not have service contracts with, or be allocated any \noverhead costs from, Buyer or any of its upstream owners , and there will not be any  \nchange to ALLETE’s cost of providing jurisdictional services  other than short -term \ntransaction costs , which will be subject to Applicants’ hold harmless commitment.66   \n43. We accept Applicants’ commitment to hold customers harmless from costs related \nto the Proposed Transaction.  We interpret Applicants’ hold harmless commitment to \napply to all transaction -related costs, including costs related to consummating the \nProposed Transaction , incurred p rior to the consummation of the Proposed Transaction, \nor in the five years after the Proposed Transaction’s consummation in accordance with \nthe Commission’s policy on hold harmless commitments .67  \nd.

Large Power Intervenors  request clarification as to whether the Commission or the \nMinnesota Commission  has the decision -making authority regarding the Proposed \nTransaction  and ask that the Commission defer judgment on the Application until such \nclarification can be made.  Large Power Intervenors state that  without Minnesota \nCommission approval of ALLETE’s proposed acquisition, ALL ETE’s disposition of \njurisdictional assets cannot be consummated .  Large Power Intervenors  state that \nclarification of the appropriate decision -making authority for this determination, as well \nas deferral of the Commission’s judgment, would grant parties necessary time and \ninformation with which to conduct their assessments of the Application and its assoc iated \nimpacts .69  Large Power Intervenors state that the Commission’s recently issued Notice \nof Inquiry highlights a concern they say is present in the Application, namely that private \nequity firms can invest with short -term profit goals incongruous with the long -term needs \nand goals of public utilities .70  Large Power Intervenors request  that if the Commission \ndeclines to defer action on the Application , that the Commission authorize the Proposed \nTransaction contingent on the Minnesota Commission’s  approva l of the Proposed \nTransaction , incorporate protections that may emerge from the Commission’s Notice of \nInquiry , and extend the comment period to allow intervenors to properly understand and \nanalyze the impacts of the Application.71 \niii. Answer  \n46. Applicants state that the Commission need not clarify its jurisdiction in this \nproceeding under FPA s ection 203 and the Commission’s  regulations.  Applicants state \nthat Large Power Intervenors  have provided no basis under Minnesota or Wisconsin law \nto contest state jurisdiction over the Proposed Transaction, and, as explained  in the \n \n68 Application at 49 . \n69 Large Power Intervenors Protest at 5-7. \n70 Id. at 7 -8 (citing F ed.

Applicants s tate that under FPA section 203, the Commission \nhas jurisdiction to assess whether the Proposed Transaction is in the public interest \npursuant to governing Commission precedent , and that the Commission’s review under \nFPA section 203 is separate and apart from the inquiry conducted by the Minnesota and \nWisconsin Commission s to evaluate if the Proposed Transaction should be approved \npursuant to applicable Minnesota and Wisconsin law .72 \n47. In response to Large Power Intervenors’ request that the Commission extend  the \ncomment period to provide the parties additional time, Applicants state that the Commission  already established a full 60 -day comment period for the Application , and \nthey argue that Large Power Intervenors  have  not explained what additional information \nis needed for the Commission to evaluate the Proposed Transaction.\n73 \niv. Commission Determination  \n48. The Commission’s review of a transaction’s effect on regulation focuses on \nensuring that it does not result in  a regula tory gap.74  As to whether a proposed \ntransaction will have an effect on state regulation, the Commission explained in the Merger Policy Statement that it ordinarily will not set the issue of the effect of a  proposed \ntransaction on state regulatory authority for a trial -type hearing where a state has \nauthority to act on the  proposed  transaction.  However, if the state lacks this authority and \nraises concerns about the effect on regulation, the Commission may set the issue for \nhearing and it will address such circumstances on a case -by-case basis .\n75   \n49. Based on Applicants’ representations, we find no evidence that either state or \nfederal regulation will be impaired by the Proposed Transaction.  Following the \ncompletion of the Proposed Transaction, Applicants  will remain under the regulatory \noversight of both the Commission and state commission s in the same manner as they are  \ncurrently.  \n50. In response to Large Power Intervenors, w hether the Proposed Transaction fulfills \nthe respective state requirements for Minnesota Commission and Wisconsin Commission \napproval is a separate question from whether the Proposed Transaction is  consistent with \nthe public interest  under FPA section 203, and our findings under FPA section 203 do not \n \n72 October 2 Answer  at 6-7. \n73 Id. at 7. \n74 Merger Policy Statement, FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 31,044 at 30,124.  \n75 Id. \nDocket No. EC24- 105-000 - 22 - \naffect those agencies’ evaluation of the Proposed Transaction pursuant to their respective \nstatutory authorities.76  In addition , because our review of the Proposed Transaction \nunder FPA section 203 is separate and apart from the inquiry conducted by the Minnesota \nCommission, we decline to a uthorize the Proposed Transaction contingent on the \nMinnesota Commission’s  approval of the Proposed Transaction .  Further, since \nApplicants must receive authorizations  by this Commission and the Minnesota \nCommission (as well as other regulatory bodies) before the Proposed Transaction may be consummated, the timing of whe ther this Commission acts before or after the Minnesota \nCommission is irrelevant .  We further note that no state regulator has raised concerns \nabout the Proposed Transaction’s effect on regulation.  \n51. We also decline to extend the comment period, as the comment  period was already \npreviously extended to give entities  60 days to review the Application.\n77  Large Power \nIntervenors did not explain  why the extended comment period was insufficient to allow \nthem  to properly understand and analyze the impacts of the Application.  Further, Large \nPower Intervenors  appear to rai se general concerns about the Commission’s approach to \nblanket authorizations  and acknowledge that the Commission has issued a Notice of \nInquiry on issues regarding blanket authorizations for investment companies .78  Our \nreview of the Proposed Transaction under FPA section 203 is separate and apart from the \nNotice of I nquiry, and we decline to take any action here related to  the issues  the \nCommiss ion is considering in response to  the Notice of Inquiry , as that proceeding \nremains pending.   \ne. Cross- Subsidization  \ni. Applicants’ Analysis  \n52. According to Applicants, the Proposed Transaction falls within one of the “safe \nharbors” established by the Commission  for which detailed explanation and evidentiary \nsupport to  demonstrate a lack of cross -subsidization is not required.  Specifically, \nApplicants  state that the Proposed Transaction falls within the “safe harbor” for \ntransactions subject to review and approval by  a state commission , specifically review \nand approval  by the Minnesota and Wisconsin Commission s.  Applicants  explain that \nboth state commissions have the authority to protect captive customers against \n \n76 16 U.S.C. § 824b(a)(4).   \n77 ALLETE, Inc. , Errata Notice Extending Comment Date, Docket No.           \nEC24- 105-000 ( issued Aug. 1, 2024).  \n78 See Notice of Inquiry, 185 FERC ¶ 61,192.  \nDocket No. EC24- 105-000 - 23 - \ninappropriate cross -subsidization for the benefit of unregulated affiliates.79  Applicants \nalso submit an Exhibit M stating  that the Proposed Transaction will not result in  cross -\nsubsidization of a non -utility associate company or the pledge or encumbrance of utility \nassets for the benefit of an associate company.80 \nii. Commission Determination  \n53. Based on Applicants’ representations, we find, subject to an informational filing  \ndiscussed below, that the Proposed Transaction will not result in the cross -subsidization \nof a non -utility associate company by a utility company, or in a pledge or encumbrance of \nutility assets for  the benefit of an associate company.  We note that no party has argued \notherwise.  \n54. Applicants  note that both the Minnesota and Wisconsin Commission s have \nauthority to protect captive customers  against inappropriate cross -subsidization .  In t he \nSupplemental Policy Statement , the Commission  indicated that an applicant qualifies for \nthe safe harbor if a state has approved  regulatory protections against inappropriate cross -\nsubsidization by captive customers .81  Here, however, the Proposed Transaction is still \nunder review at tho se state c ommissions .  Accordingly, consistent with the Supplemental \nPolicy Statement, we will require  the Applicants to submit an informational filing in this \ndocket within 10  days of e ach state commission’s action on the Proposed Transaction \nexplaining  that the P roposed T ransaction complies with specific state regulatory \nprotections against  inappropriate cross -subsidization by captive customers .82 \nf.

Joint Protestors assert that the recent  acquisition of Global Infrastructure \nManagement by BlackRock  change s the facts, policies, and procedures the Commission \nrelied upon in granting BlackRock blanket authorization  to control up to 20% of the \nvoting shares of utilities, a nd therefore  first requires BlackRock to “inform the \nCommission within 30 days of any material change in circumstances that would reflect   \na departure from the facts, policies, and procedures the Commission relied upon in \n \n79 Application at 49 -50. \n80 Id. at 50 -51, Ex.

Joint Protestors further state that BlackRock also controls 10.81% and 10.41%, \nrespectively, of Cleveland Cliffs and US Steel —two industrial customers of ALLETE \nrepresenting 70% of Minnesota Power’s industrial demand.  Joint Protestors argue that \nBlackRock’s control of 13% of ALLETE’s voting shares and more than 10% of two o f its \nlargest customers raises concerns about horizontal competition and conflict of interest \nand that the A pplication is silent on “ how BlackRock can simultaneously manage its  \nnon-controlling ownership of voting shares of utilities that compete with its active, direct \nholdings .”85  Further, Joint Protestors state that BlackRock  “controls voting shares in \nexcess of 10% of at least 19 different electric utilities ,” and that the Proposed Transaction \ntransforms BlackRock’s business model from that of a non- controlling asset manager to \nacquiring securities that will result in the transfer of control over a public utility, \n“rendering the facts and conditions of the blanket authorization to be null and void .”86  \nJoint Protestors request that the Commission hold this proceeding in abeyance until it \ncompletes its review of how the BlackRock Transaction  and the Proposed Transaction  \nmaterially change the facts of BlackRock’s blanket authorization .87 \n57. In the October 25 Comments, Joint Protestors state that approval of the BlackRock \nTransaction  on September 6, 2024  resulted  in a “ material change in circumstances that \nwould reflect a departure from the facts, policies, and procedures the Commission relied upon in granting ” BlackRock  its blanket authorization , and that BlackRock  violated its \nblanket authorization by failing to notify the Commission  within 30 days of the \nCommission’s approval of the BlackRock Transaction .\n88  Joint Protestors argue this \nalleged  violation of BlackRock’s blanket authorization  should result in holding this \nproceeding in abeyance until BlackRock is in compliance with the terms of its blanket \n \n83 Joint Protest at 1.  \n84 Id. at 2. \n85 Id. at 2-3. \n86 Id. at 3. \n87 Id. at 4. \n88 October 25 Comments at 1. \nDocket No. EC24- 105-000 - 25 - \nauthorization  and until the Commission has completed its review of the changes in the \nfacts, policies and procedures o f the blanket authorization .89  \n58. In the November 1 Comments, Joint Protestors state that on October 21, 2024, \nBlackRock and its subsidiaries filed an application  in Docket No. EC25 -12-000 for \nreauthorization and extension of its blanket authorizations  (BlackRock Reauthorization \nApplication).  Joint Protestors argue that because Joint Protestors specifically raised the \nissue of how BlackRock’s blanket authorization directly conflicts with its attempt to \nacquire ALLETE , BlackRock  should have notified Joint Protestors  of the BlackRock \nReauthorization Application.  In the November 1 Comments and the November 12 Comments, Joint Protestors also repeat their request that the Commission hold this \nproceeding in abeyance until the Commi ssion  has completed its review o f the BlackRock \nReauthorization Application  in Docket No. EC25- 12-000.\n90   \nii. Answers \n59. Applicants assert that  Joint Protestors’ request that the Commission reject the \nApplication or otherwise delay this proceeding until the Commission can “complete” its review of BlackRock’s blanket authorization  should be dismissed because it is  beyond \nthe scope of this proceeding and irrelevant to the Commission’s consideration of the Proposed Transaction.  Applicants note that  the Commission recently explained in \nresponse to similar arguments made by Joint Protestors in the BlackRock Transaction  \nproceeding  that concerns about the conditions applicable to a specific applicant’s blanket \nauthorization may be raised in a proceeding where that applicant files for authorization or reauthorization of a blanket authorization.\n91  Applicants  also state that the Commission \nhas stated  that concerns related to the Commission’s general approach to blanket \nauthorizations should be addressed in the Notice of Inquiry proceeding.92   \n60. Applicants argue that the Commission should reject Joint Protestors’ claims \ntheorizing that BlackRock’s indirect, non -controlling holdings under its b lanket \nauthorization could pose a “conflict of interest” that threatens or is otherwise inconsistent \nwith the public interest.  Applicants explain that BlackRock will no longer hold indirect, non-controlling interests in ALLETE under its b lanket authorization following close of \nthe Proposed Transaction, which will take the entirety o f ALLETE from being a publicly \n \n89 Id. at 1-2. \n90 November 1 Comments at 1-2 ; November 12 Comments at 2. \n91 October 2 Answer at 3 (citing Glo b.

Applicants state that there is not, and \ncannot be, any “conflict” between BlackRock’s non -controlling interests in ALLETE \nunder its b lanket authorization and the active interests i n ALLETE that Global \nInfrastructure Management (and, therefore, BlackRock) will hold as a result of the \nProposed Transaction because both will not exist at the same time.  Applicants further \nassert that BlackRock’s various non-controlling investments in utility securities under its \nblanket authorization are not relevant to the  Commission’s analysis of the Proposed \nTransaction.  Applicants state that the  Commission has explained  that the utilities whose \nsecurities are held by an investor (e.g., BlackRock) under such a blanket authorization are \nnot controlled by the investor, and that the Commission has routinely authorized \ntransactions involving the acquisition of active interests in public utilities under FPA \nsection 203 without requiring examination of investments held pursuant to a blanket \nauthorization .93 \n61. In the November 12 Answer, Applicants assert that the Commission should reject \nJoint Protestors ’ irrelevant and unsupported request to hold the Application in abeyance \nuntil the Commission has completed its review of the BlackRock  Reauthorization \nApplication.  Applicants argue that Joint Protestors have had ample opportunity to raise \nany concerns related to the Application in this proceeding , where they have made \nmultiple filings, which Applicants have answered .94  \niii. Commission Determination  \n62. We decline to delay action in this proceeding  until the Commission  completes its \nreview of if or how the BlackRock Transaction  and the Proposed Transaction  materially \nchange the facts of BlackRock’s blanket authorization, as requested by Joint Protestors.  We decline to reassess BlackRock’s blanket authorization  in this proceeding because \nquestions about the conditions applicable to  BlackRock’s  blanket authorization are \nbeyond the scope of this proceeding.  Concerns about the conditions applicable to a \nspecific applicant’s blanket authorization , the applicant’s  holdings associated with its \nblanket authorization, and whether and how separate transactions impac t the blanket \nauthorization  may be raised in a proceeding where that applicant files for authorization or \nreauthorization of a blanket authorization.  We note that the BlackRock Reauthorization \nApplication is pending before the Commission . \n63. As to BlackRock’s specific holdings in ALLETE , we agree that BlackRock will \nno longer hold indirect, non -controlling interests in ALLETE under its blanket \nauthorization following close of the Proposed Transaction .  The Proposed Transaction \nwill result in ALLETE changing from a publicly traded company to a privately held \n \n93 Id. at 4 -5. \n94 November 12 Answer at 2 -3. \nDocket No. EC24- 105-000 - 27 - \ncompany, held  by Canadian Pension Plan Investments and G lobal Infrastructure \nManagement , the latter of which is owned entirely  by BlackRock.95   \n3. Other Considerations  \n64. Information and/or systems connected to the B ulk Power S ystem involved in this \ntransaction may be subject to reliability and cybersecurity standards approved by the \nCommission pursuant to FPA section 215.96  Compliance with these standards is \nmandatory and  enforceable regardless of the physical location of the affiliates or \ninvestors, information database, and operating systems.  If affiliates, personnel or investors are not authorized for access to such information and/or systems connected to the Bulk Power System, a public utility is obligated to take the appropriate measures to \ndeny access to this information and/or the equipment/software connected to the B ulk \nPower System.  The mechanisms that deny access to information, procedures, software, \nequipment, etc., must comply with all applicable reliability and cybersecurity standards. \nThe Commission, North America n Electric Reliability Corporation , or the relevant \nregional entity may audit compliance with reliability and cybersecurity standards. \n65. FPA section 3 01(c) gives the Commission authority to examine the books and \nrecords of any person who controls, directly or indirectly, a jurisdictional public utility \ninsofar as the books and records relate to transactions with or the business of such public utility.\n97  The approval of the Proposed Transaction is based on such examination ability.  \nIn addition, applicants subject to Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005  (PUHCA \n2005 )98 are subject to the record -keeping and books and records requirements of PUHCA \n2005.  \n66. Section 35.42 of the Commission’s regulations  requires that sellers with market -\nbased rate authority timely report to the Commission any change in status that would reflect a departure from the characteristics the Commission relied upon in gran ting \n \n95 See October 2 Answer at 4 -5; see also Glob.

With respect to App licants’ hydroelectric generating stations, the authorization in \nthis proceeding is made under FPA section 203 and is not an authorization for the \nlicensee to transfer its license or any rights thereunder granted , including property rights \nthat are  necessary to operate and maintain the project s.  The licensee is prohibited from \nselling, leasing, transferring, abandoning, or otherwise disposing of the project , including \nall project property  covered by the license, until Commission authorization is al so \nreceived pursuant to Part 9 of the Commission’s regulations,100 and as required by \nstandard Article 5 of the license.101  The authorization in this proceeding under FPA \nsection 203 does not prejudge the Commission’s determination on an application for approval to transfer a license or to voluntarily sell, lease, transfer, abandon, or otherwise \ndispose of project  property . \nThe Commission orders : \n \n(A) The Proposed Transaction is hereby authorized, as discussed in the body of \nthis order.   \n \n(B) Applicants are directed to submit an informational filing within 10 days of \neach state commission’s approval of potential ring -fencing provisions, as discussed in the \nbody of this order.  \n \n(C) Applicants must inform the Commission of any material change in \ncircumstances that departs from the facts or representations that the Commission relied upon in authorizing the Proposed Transaction within 30 days from the date of the  \nmaterial change in circumstances .   \n \n(D) The foregoing authorization is without prejudice to the authority  of the \nCommission or any other regulatory  body with respect to rates, service, accounts, \nvaluation, estimates or determinations of costs, or any other matter whatsoever now \npending or which  may come before the Commission.  \n \n(E) Nothing in this order shall be construed to imply acquiescence in any \nestimate or determination of cost or any valuation of property claimed or asserted.  \n \n99 18 C.F.R. §  35.42  (2024) . \n100 18 C.F.R. p t. 9 (2024) . \n101 18 C.F.R. § 2.9 (2024). \nDocket No. EC24- 105-000 - 29 - \n \n(F) The Commission retains authority under sections 203(b) and 309 of the \nFPA to issue supplemental orders as appropriate.  \n \n(G) Applicants sh all make any appropriate filings under section 205 of the FPA, \nas necessary, to implement the Proposed Transaction.  \n \n(H) Applicants shall notify the Commission within 10 days of the date on which \nthe Proposed Transaction is consummated.  \n \n(I) If Applicants seek to recover transaction -related costs through their \ntransmission or wholesale requirements rates, they must make a new FPA section 205 \nfiling and submit concurrently an informational filing in the instant FPA section 203 docket.
