Putting a handful of weak\nconditions on a fundamentally dangerous bargain does not make it “in the public interest.”\nThe companies pushing this deal utterly failed to make their case—there is no proof that this funding is\nneeded, nor that new owners will support the clean energy transition we need. There is no basis upon\nwhich to approve this deal, and a long record of harms and risks supporting denial.\nI expect Commissioners to listen to the majority of voices in this proceeding, including the Administrative\nLaw Judge, who recognize this deal for what it is: a perilous gamble that hands Minnesota’s energy\nfuture over to rapacious private equity interests at the expense of customers, workers, and local business\nand industry.\nDo your duty under Minnesota law to look out for the best interests of Minnesota Power customers,\nMinnesotans across the state, and the public as a whole, and reject the acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota\nPower by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners.

    "content": "STATE OF MINNESOTA  \n \nBEFORE THE  \nMINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION  \n \n \nIn the Matter of the Joint Petition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investm ent Board and Global \nInfrastructure Partners  \nPension Plan Investment Board    PUC Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 \n IBEW Local 31  -  \nEXCEPTIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE’S REPORT\n \nPursuant to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s July 18, 2025, Notice  of ALJ \nReport and Opportunity to File Exceptions, the International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers (IBEW)  Local 31 respectfully submits the following Exceptions to the \nAdministrative Law Judge’s (ALJ) Findings of Fact, Conclusions, and Recommendations \nin the above -captioned matter. These Exceptions are grounded in our position as the \nexclusive representative for many of the skilled utility workers at Minnesota Power and reflect our interest in ensuring that any transfer of ownership does not diminish labor protections or operational stability.  \nI. EXCEPTION TO FINDING G – LABOR IMPACTS\n \nA. The ALJ’s citation of broad private equity data lacks application to the regulated \nutility context.  \n \nThe ALJ cites a 2019 University of Chicago and Harvard Business School study, which \nfound that employment declines by 13 percent over two years following take -private \nbuyouts of publicly listed firms, and that the bankruptcy risk for such firms is ten times higher than firms that were not taken private. While these statistics are academically \ncredible and contextually useful, they do not reflect the distinct regulatory structure or \ncapital recovery model applicable to Minnesota Power.1 \nThis study does not consider the unique protections embedded in the regulated utility environment. The acquiring entities , GIP and CPP Investments , are infrastructure- focused \ninvestors that theoretically rely on the financial health and long- term operational stability \nof the utility in order to realize returns via cost recovery mechanisms regulated by the Commission. As such, it would be counterproductive to destabilize Minnesota Power, the vehicle through which those regulated returns are recovered.  \nB. Labor  risk and the role of oversight   \n \nThe ALJ concludes that there is credible evidence of potential labor risks arising from \nprivate equity acquisitions, including the possibility of layoffs or erosion of worker protections. IBEW Local 31 acknowledges this concern but emphasizes that Minnesota’s \nregulatory structure , including the Commission’s oversight authority and statutory \nobligations , provides an important safeguard. Should adverse impacts to the union \nworkforce materialize, IBEW Local 31 affirms the importance of the Commission as a meaningful forum to raise and resolve such concerns. The Commission's visible ongoing responsibility to ensure fair treatment of both workers and consumers offers a critical layer of protection under Minnesota law . \nC. The ALJ’s reference to SunPower’s bankruptcy illustrates the contrast between \nunregulated and regulated energy sectors.  \n \n \n1 ALJ Report, Finding 276, Section G, Labor Impacts, citing 2019 University of Chicago and Harvard \nBusiness School study  \nIn highlighting the recent SunPower bankruptcy, the ALJ draws a relevant distinction \nbetween the largely unregulated, non- unionized clean energy industry and the highly \nregulated environment of a public utility.2 SunPower’s collapse underscores the risks \nfaced by workers and customers when regulatory oversight is absent. Unlike firms operating in competitive clean energy markets, Minnesota Power operates under statutory and regulatory structures that embed accountability and safeguard reliability, fiscal \ndiscipline, and labor protections.  The retention of assets by a utility, particularly within \nthe Minnesota regulatory framework, enables this crucial oversight to occur.  We concur \nwith Judge McKenzie ’s finding that the SunPower model  differs  greatly from Minnesota \nPower ’s structure  but wish to emphasize the pressing need to focus meaningful \ninvestment in the regulated sector . \nD. The clean energy industry’s labor record further supports regulated utility \ninvestment models.  \n \nAs reflected in public comments and policy research, the clean energy sector is frequently \nassociated with lower wages, diminished worker protection s, and business models that \nprioritize profit maximization in unregulated markets.  In contrast, the entry of private \ncapital into the regulated utility space offers an opportunity to reinforce and extend \nprotections , including workforce stability, collective bargaining, and long -term \ninfrastructure investment tied to enforceable standards.  \nII. COMMENT ON DOC STIPULATIONS – WORKFORCE AND \nENFORCEMENT MEASURES  \n \n \n2 ALJ Report, Finding 473.  \nIBEW Local 31 applauds the Minnesota Department of Commerce (DOC) for securing \nmeaningful stipulations and enf orceable language that serve the public interest. In \nparticular, we strongly support:  \n the Commission’s retained authority to impose penalties under Minn. Stat. § 216B.57 for \nviolations of the stipulations or Commission orders;  the requirement for annual \ncompliance reporting for a ten- year period post -closing, which must include:  \no Workforce levels  \no Labor relations  \no Statu s of collective bargaining agreements.  \n These commitments reflect a balanced and transparent approach that strengthens oversight while acknowledging the vital role of workers in utility performance and public service delivery .\n3 \nIII. CO NCLUSION \n IBEW Local 31 respectfully takes exception to the ALJ’s findings as they relate to labor impacts and the presumed risks associated with private equity investment. We believe the record demonstrates that the potential for long- term financial stability and responsible \ninfrastructure investment under the proposed transaction outweighs the generalized and unproven risks cited in opposition. With the thoughtful stipulations secured by the Department of Commerce , including enforceable reporting and oversight mechanisms \n \n3 DOC Stipulations, Section III, Reporting and Enforcement Provisions.  \nthat prioritize labor stability and accountability , we support the transaction’s approval as \nstructured. \n Dated:   August 4, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \nKristin Renskers  \n \n/s/   Kristin Renskers \nKristin Renskers \nBusiness Manager/Financial Secretary  \nIBEW Local 31  \n2002 London Rd, Ste 105 Duluth, MN 55812   PHONE:  218.969.2201 \nEMAIL:  krenskers@ibew31.com"

    "content": "CORRECTED: Comments from Operating Engineers Local 49  \nand North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters  \nAugust 4, 2025  \nMr. Mike Bull  \nActing Executive Secretary  \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission 121 7th Place East, Suite 350  \nSt. Paul, MN 55101  \nRe: Letter of Support – Docket No. PA -24-198 – Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners  \nDear Commissioners,  \nOn behalf of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49 and the North Central States \nRegional Council of Carpenters, which represent over 25,000 members across Minnesota, we fully \nsupport the Settlement between the Department of Commerce, ALLETE/ Minnesota Power, Global \nInfras tructure Partners and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (DOC Settlement) .  \nWe believe that the DOC S ettlement and acquisition represent significant benefits for Minnesota workers, \ncustomers, and local communities, particularly in terms of job security, investment in local infrastructure, \nand workforce stability. Our unions concur with the Department of C ommerce and other parties who \nreviewed the transaction to ensure continued secure investment, sustained affordable energy, and \nassistance with driving clean energy initiatives.  \nThe buyers, CPP Investments and GIP, have publicly committed to honoring existing workforce \nagreements, keeping ALLETE locally managed, maintaining high labor standards, and collaborating on \nfuture infrastructure needs to support both reliability and decar bonization. This commitment respects \nexisting workforce agreements, maintains high labor standards, and works collaboratively to address \nMinnesota’s future energy and infrastructure needs. Based on the direction the owners plan to take this \nacquisition, we  anticipate positive impacts for jobs, workforce stability, and local surrounding \ncommunities. This deal will continue to uphold commitments to a union workforce, safe workplaces and \ninvestment in local infrastructure as Minnesota continues to pursue an am bitious clean energy and grid \nmodernization goal.  \nThis acquisition will also facilitate immediate savings and significant benefits to Minnesota Power’s \ncustomers and communities. With the inclusion of a rate freeze and forgiveness program, it is consistent \nwith the public interest according to the DOC and  many stakeholders. Approval of the transaction is \nnecessary to secure the capital and experienced ownership required for Minnesota Power to maintain its \nservice commitments and support robust regional economic activity.  \nIn summary, both the Carpenters and Operating Engineers Local 49 urge the Minnesota Public Utilities \nCommission to reject the ALJ’s recommendations and approve the DOC settlement, emphasizing the \nbroader value to Minnesota’s workforce, electric reliability, and affordability. We urge the PUC to \napprove the transaction as being in the public interest and beneficial for Minneso ta workers and \ncommunities.  \nThank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require further information. \nSincerely,  \nRichard Kolodziejski, Director of Government Affairs, North Central States Regional Council of \nCarpenters  \nNathan Runke, Regulatory and Political Affairs Coordinator, International Union of Operating Engineers \nLocal 49"

We would, however, respec�ully submit  the following  excep�ons to \nclarify the record.  \n As part of its larger review of the acquisi�on, t he ALJ Report  analyzes the commitments secured \nfrom Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners  (collec�vely \n“the Partners ”) and ALLETE by ECC and , in most instances, ques�ons the impact of those \nconcessions on advancing the public interest. ECC respec�ully submits that, in several cases,  the \nReport’s analysis lacks cri�cal context that underscores the importance and impact of these \nconcessions.  ECC oﬀers its own analysis of the contextual importance of each commitment \nbelow.  \n \n1. There will be no reduc�on in the CARE program budget so long as the Partners own \nALLETE.  \nIn Finding Number 155 , the ALJ states that this commitment oﬀers no diﬀerence from the status \nquo, no�ng that CARE is a ratepayer -funded program  for which the Commission has repeatedly \n\nallowed the Company to recover costs. The Report also notes that the percent -of-income \naﬀordability program is currently closed to new par�cipants.  While this is accurate, it lacks \ncrucial context  from outside these proceedings .  \n \nConcurrent to the proceedings in this docket, par�es in Docket  Number E015/M -11-409 are \ndelibera�ng through a stakeholder group over poten�al changes to the eligibility parameters \nand poten�al budget  increase for the CARE program. 0F1 For ECC, t he Partners’  commitment to \nmaintain the budget at current levels at the  �me of sale was never meant to be taken in \nisola�on but was rather meant to work in concert with separate stakeholder nego�a�ons. The \ncommitment made in this docket aﬀords the Commission the opportunity to leverage \ndelibera�ons in  Docket Number E015/M -11-409 to establish a poten�ally higher  baseline level \nof investment in that necessary program.  While those stakeholder conversa�ons are ongoing, it \nshould be noted that the purview given to the stakeholder group by the Commission explicitly \ndirects stakeholders to vet proposals to reopen the percent -of-income aﬀordability  discount \npor�on of the  program.  \n \nIt should also be noted that, while aﬀordability programs are ratepayer funded, that does not \nnecessarily mean that u�li�es are eager to raise surcharges to fund their e xpansion. When \nu�li�es bring proposals to raise surcharges before the Commission, it can elicit  addi�onal \nscru�ny of the company in ques�on’s overall aﬀordability of service . The Report’s observa�on \nthat the Commission has generally approved surcharge increases when the Company has \nbrought them before the Commission does not adequately acknowledge the re�cence the \nCompany may have to do so . For that reason , it is vital for the Commission to establish a strong \nbaseline investment in the CARE program at the �me of acquisi�on and safeguard that \ninvestment through ﬁrm commitments by the Partners.  \n \n2.  The Partners will oﬀer a ﬁnancial contribu�on  with the objec�ve of reducing  arrear s to \npre-COVID levels or lower. A similar program will be oﬀered for non -low-income  \nqualiﬁed customers.  \nIn Finding Number 155 , the ALJ acknowledges that it is in the public interest to pay down low -\nincome residen�al arrears 1F2 and indicat es in Finding Number 180 that the Partners ’ oﬀer to \nprovide  their own capital for the purpose of paying down arrears is the most signiﬁcant \nconcession oﬀered by the Partners to date. 2F3 However, the ALJ then ques�ons the overall \nsigniﬁcance of these concessions given that  this could poten�ally only amount to a $1 million \n \n1 ORDER. DOCKET NO. E015/M -11-409. In the Matter of Minnesota Power’s Petition for Approval of a Rider for \nCustomer Affordability of Residential Electricity (CARE).  July 11, 2025.  \n2 Report  at 33 . \n3 Report at 38.  \nreduc�on and that nego�a�ons in other acquisi�on setlements na�onally have exacted a much \nlarger aggregate beneﬁt for ratepayers. 3F4  \n \nIn response, ECC would like to oﬀer the following  context  for the Commission to consider:   \n \n1. First, ECC wishes to clarify that the Partners’ ﬁnancial commitment for arrearage \nforgiveness is “not to exceed residen�al customer arrears as of the approval date.” 4F5 \nBased on Minnesota Power’s Residen�al Customer Status Reports, residen�al arrears \naveraged approximately $3.5 million in 2024 and average $4.5 million year -to-date in \n2025. Preceding the pandemic, residen�al arrears averaged closer to $2.5 million. 5F6 \n \n2. There is value in returning to pre -COVID arrearage levels that extends beyond the \ndollar amount. Several u�li�es have argued that t he current rise in arrearage levels  \ncomes in large part from the accumula�on of arrears that happened during the \nCOVID -19 disconnec�on moratorium and has been exacerbated by the struggles of \nlow-income people with the macroeconomic reali�es of post -COVID life. 6F7 A \nfounda�onal part of ECC’s desire to return to pre -COVID arrearage levels was to deny \nthe Company and its would -be new owners the plausible deniability  of con�nuing to \ncite the moratorium in scru�ny of its arrearage levels going forward.  \n \n3. ECC stated from the outset in its pe��on to intervene that our objec�ve was to \nadvocate speciﬁcally for low - and ﬁxed -income customers.  We never presumed that \nour nego�a�ons with the Company and the Partners would be the only concessions \nfor ratepayers broadly in this mater. We are of course deeply concerned with the \nwell-being of all ratepayers , regardless of whether they are income qualiﬁed . \nHowever, the reality is that ECC’s nego�a�ons happened concurrently with the \nPartners’ and the Company’s nego�a�ons with other Par�es in this proceeding. ECC was aware that many of those par�es were and s�ll are seeking concessions around \nresource planning and capital investment that will have profound impacts on the \nCompany’s revenue requirements going forward. While  we sought to protect low -\nincome customers from the outset, it seemed premature to  independently nego�ate \narrangements for the ratepayer network broadly un�l the full concessions of all \nsetlements were known.  \n \n4. The Commission should not lose sight of the value of having an infusion of funds into \naﬀordability programming that comes from shareholders and not other ratepayers. \n \n4 Report at 38.   \n5 Settlement at 10.  \n6 See Dockets 19 -2, 24- 2, and 25- 2. \n7 See the Thirteenth Annual  CARE Report in Docket No. E015/M -11-409 and Xcel’s 2023 Service Quality \nReport in Docket No. E-002/M -24-27.  \nWhile ECC is of course a proponent of ratepayer -funded aﬀordability programs, an \nunfortunate reality of that work is that advocates are o�en le� deba�ng how much \nto raise surcharges on other ratepayers, many of whom may also be suﬀering. This is \na pow erful opportunity to draw shareholders into the work of funding and sustaining \narrearage relief and CARE aﬀordability beneﬁts for Minnesota Power customers.  \n \n5. Lastly, ECC would note that placing the numerical value of this concession in propor�on to the valua�on of the macro valua�on of the transac�on obscures the micro -level potency of this concession. For those receiving this arrearage \nforgiveness, it may very well mean a lessen ed need to choose between medicine, \nfood and u�li�es. These are working families across the Company’s service territory who are s�ll clawing their way out of a once -in-a-genera�on cost of living crisis with \neven more uncertainty on the horizon.  \n \nECC once again thanks the Commission for considering these excep�ons. While we are grateful \nfor the ALJ’s review of the record, ECC hopes that the added context provided above will help \nilluminate why we believe that the concessions the Partners and ALLETE  have oﬀered are in fact \nmeaningful safeguards of the public interest.   \n Sincerely,  \nGeorge Wm Shardlow  \nGeorge Shardlow  \nExecutive Director  \nEnergy CENTS Coalition  \n823 East 7th Street  \nSaint Paul, MN 55106  \ngeorge@energycents.org  | 651 -245-1644 \n\nFirst Name\nLast Name \nEmail \nCompany Name \nAddress \nDelivery Method \nView Trade Secret \nService List Name \nKevin\nAdams \nkadams@caprw.org \nCommunity Action \nPartnership of Ramsey & \nWashington Counties \n450 Syndicate St N Ste 35 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaint Paul, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMN \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t55104 \nElectronic Service \nNo \nOFF_SL_24-198_Official \nCraig\nAddonizio \ncraig.addonizio@state.mn. \nus \nDepartment of Commerce \n85 7th Place, Suite 280 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSt Paul, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMN \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t55101 \nElectronic Service \nNo \nOFF_SL_24-198_Official \nJorge\nAlonso \njorge.alonso@state.mn.us \nPublic Utilities Commission \n121 7th Place East \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSuite 350 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSt. Paul, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMN \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t55101 \nElectronic Service \nNo \nOFF_SL_24-198_Official \nLori\nAndresen \ninfo@sosbluewaters.org \nSave Our Sky Blue Waters \nP.O.

ECC believes that the s�pula�ons of the Setlement advance the public \ninterest, and we respec�ully request that the Commission approves it . \n \nOur comment s are structured as follows. First , we provide context on the priori�es of ECC in our \ninterven�on in this mater. Second, we iden�fy broad themes that we believe have shaped the \nrecord and our own analysis thereof. Finally, we highlight key s�pula�ons within the Setlement \nthat we believe underscore the compa�bility of the acquisi�on with the public interest.    \n \nI. ECC intervened to advocate on behalf of low - and ﬁxed -income Minnesota Power \ncustomers.  \nOn September 13, 2024, ECC pe��oned  t o  i n t e r v e n e  i n  t h i s  m a t e r  w i t h  t h e  s t a t e d  a i m  o f  \nadvoca�ng speciﬁcally on behalf of low -income customers. As noted in our ﬁling, ECC has a long \nhistory of advoca�ng on behalf of Minnesota Power’s (“MP”) low - and ﬁxed -income customers \nthrough interven�ons on rate design and most especially through extensive consulta�on and \ncollabora�on on program design and oversight of the Customer Aﬀordability of Residen�al \n\n2 \n Electricity (CARE) program. In intervening, ECC sought to review the poten�al beneﬁts and harms \nof the transac�on for low -income customers broadly with a par�cular focus on CARE par�cipants.  \n \nII. Key themes regarding t he public interest standard in acquisition proceedings  and the \ncategories of stip ulations in this Settlement  \nThe ques�on before the Commission is whether the proposed transac�on is compa�ble with the \npublic interest  or, as ECC more speciﬁcally construed it in our surrebutal:   \nThe founda�onal ques�on before the Commission is whether there are categorical \ndis�nc�ons between publicly and privately held u�li�es that would cause the acquisi�on \nto be incompa�ble with the public interest, speciﬁcally within the regulatory landscape of \nMinnesota. That is, does the transfer to private ownership present a novel harm to \nconsumers that is inadequately contemplated by the legal and regulatory restric�ons of \nthe State of Minnesota. 0F1 \nWhile there are statutory diﬀerences between the requirements imposed on investor -owned \nu�li�es and other ownership models, such as coopera�vely and municipally owned u�li�es , \nrequirements for investor -owned u�li�es under state law remain in eﬀect whether the company \nis traded publicly or privately.  To our knowledge, no party in this mater has demonstrated that \nthe acquisi�on would diminish the extent to which MP is subject to the requirements for investor -\nowned u�li�es in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 216B.  \nThe ques�on thus becomes whether the statutory requirements remain adequate for a privately \nowned u�lity or whether the process of going private undermines Minnesota’s exis�ng method \nof regulatory oversight . ECC indicated its support for the acquisi�on, not out of a moral \nassessment of the Partners  and their inten�ons, but out of a deep convic�on that the regulatory \nguardrails of this State a re adequate to advance the public interest irrespec�ve of the inten�ons \nof u�li�es.  Par�es opposing the ac quisi�on have indicated they disagree , alleging that there is a \ncategorical diﬀerence between the proﬁt mo�ve of publicly - and privately -traded companies that \nwould make ALLETE under the ownership of Partners  into an unwilling par�cipant in the \nregulatory compact, even if the compact’s legal requirements s�ll technically apply . That \ndisagreement is the central controversy in this mater.   \nAs a result, the Commission will see two types of commitments in the Setlem ent: \n1) Novel ﬁnancial and opera�onal commitments by MP and the Partners  that are not \nexplicitly required by law, and  \n2) Aﬃrma�ons of and commitments to exis�ng statutory requirements.  \n \n1 ECC Surrebuttal  at 1.  \n3 \n The former is to be expected.  The Setlement contains meaningful commitments by the Partners  \nthat help mi�gate the risks of poten�al harm under new leadership.  The later category – \naﬃrma�on of exis�ng law – could reasonably be deemed as superﬂuous. Why commit to that \nwhich is already required by law ? The reason is that, p rac�cally speaking, people ’s lives  are not \ngoverned by laws;  they are governed by legal interpreta�on.  ECC would argue that the exercise \nof jointly acknowledging regulatory requirements and oﬀering Par�es the opportunity to ground \nthemselves in a shared interpreta�on of those requirements works to directly mi�gate the \npoten�al harm raised by par�es in this mater of a future in which the Company complied in law \nbut not spirit with the founda�onal responsibili�es of a u�lity within Minnesota’s regulatory \ncompact.   \nIII. Review of relevant stipulations  \nBelow, ECC highlights the s�pula�ons of the Setlement that we believe most acutely speak to the \npublic interest in this proceeding. They are as follows:  \n1.3. To alleviate concerns about the availability of investment funds, Alloy Parent shall provide \nto Minnesota Power equity ﬁnancing, including but not limited to equity infusion, deferral or \nreinvestment of dividends, or a combina�on of both, in an amount at  least equal to the equity  \nﬁnancing required to fund Minnesota Power’s 5- year capital investment plan reﬂected in its \nFebruary 2025 10 -K ﬁling, subject to prospec�ve reasonable and prudent plan adjustments. \nThis funding commitment will not be used to e stablish a higher or lower ROE.  \n1.4 To ensure enforceability of the capital commitment, ALLETE shall not make any dividend payments to Alloy Parent (the en�ty through which the Partners would receive any dividends \nfrom the company) unless, at the �me the dividend payment would be made,  Minnesota Power \nhas been provided suﬃcient equity capital needed up to that point in �me to fund the 5-  year \ncapital investment plan in the February 2025 10- K, subject to prospec�ve reasonable and \nprudent plan adjustments by the company.  \nThe Company has named access to capital as the driving need that prompted it to seek new \nownership. Other par�es in this mater raised concerns that nothing would legally compel the \nPartners  to supply ALLETE with capital. By predica�ng the Partners’ ability  to issue dividends  to \nthe full funding of the 5-year capital plan, the Department has succeeded in binding the Partners  \nto a clear ﬁnancial incen�ve t o invest in ALLETE.   \n1.6 ALLETE shall not make any dividend or distribu�ons to Alloy Parent unless at least one \nsenior unsecured credit ra�ng is investment grade or above. For the avoidance of doubt, the \nlimit on distribu�ons shall not apply to payments made by ALLETE to an y Alloy Parent en��es \nor ALLETE subsidiaries under the tax sharing agreement . \n4 \n Similarly, S�pula�on 1.6 applies a clear (if indirect)  ﬁnancial incen�ve to contain rate growth. As \nnoted elsewhere in the record , credit ra�ng agencies have begun ci�ng concerns about \naﬀordability as a reason to downgrade u�li�es. 1F2 If the Partners  were to atempt to maximize \nproﬁts from the Company by dispropor�onately raising  rates  (subject to Commission approval), \nthey would do so at the risk of diminishing their c redit ra�ng. S�pula�on 1.6 ensures that , if that \nwere to happen, they would also endanger their ability to issue dividends.   \n1.47 Regarding energy aﬀordability for residen�al customers, there will be no reduc�on in \nMinnesota Power’s currently designed aﬀordability program budget (formally referred to as the Customer Aﬀordability of Residen�al Electricity program or “CARE”)  or the current CARE \nprogram eligibility process for the dura�on of the Partners’ ownership of ALLETE.  \n1.48 The Partners will provide a ﬁnancial contribu�on with the objec�ve to signiﬁcantly reduce \nresiden�al arrears to pre -COVID -19 balances or lower, an outcome that would beneﬁt all \nMinnesota Power customers while providing account balance relief to the most economically challenged residen�al customers. This contribu�on will be used to temporarily augment the \nﬂat $20 discount and Arrearage Forgiveness components of Minnesota Power’ s CARE program. \nA similar arrearage forgiveness oﬀering will be dev eloped on a limited scope and dura�on basis \nfor non -income qualiﬁed residen�al customers that successfully enter into and complete a 24-\nmonth payment arrangement for arrears, pending conﬁrma�on of billing system capability and \nreasonable level of eﬀo rt… The total ﬁnancial contribu�on is not to exceed the total balance of \nresiden�al customer arrears as of the approval date.  \nS�pula�ons 1.47 and 1.48 enshrine an agreement between ECC, ALLETE  and the Partners. ECC \nthanks all par�es for the inclusion of these provisions in the ul�mate setlement. As we have \nstate d previously, these concessions oﬀer meaningful assurance to low -income customers that \nthe quality of MP’s aﬀordability programs will not deteriorate under new ownership.  In the \nnormal course of opera�ons, funding for aﬀordability programs must come from other ratepayers, many of whom are themselves struggling to get by. These concessions oﬀer a unique \nopportunity to draw investment from shareholders, and not other customers, in these vital \nprograms.   \nThe agreement also oﬀers a historic opportunity to extend arrearage forgiveness to non -income \nqualiﬁed customers at a crucial moment. As currently designed, CARE is tailored to customers \nwho have been determined income -eligible through the federal energy assistance  applica�on \nprocess , a program which is currently at risk of elimina�on.\n2F3 ECC inten�onally and collabora�vely \nworked with Minnesota Power to iden�fy a meaningful contribu�on toward reducing residen�al \n \n2 Walters Direct at 14. \n3 LeMoult, Craig. “ Trump budget proposal would end energy assistance program for low -income Americans .” \nNational Public Radio –  Morning Edition. May 15, 2025.  \n \n5 \n arrears that would build upon the success of income -based programs like LIHEAP and CARE, while \nhelping to reach those who may be just outside the reach of the income -based requirements and \ndeﬁni�ons tradi�onally used for these programs.  \nIn conversa�on with Minnesota Power, it is ECC’s understanding that most  residen�al arrears \nbalances are with customers who do not have an income -eligibility designa�on. Depending on \nthe �me of year, this can be 85% or greater of residen�al arrears balances with no income -\neligibility designa�on. While some of these custome r s  m a y  b e  i n c o m e -eligible, they have not \npursued op�ons like self -declara�on or LIHEAP . As such, it is ECC’s view that an immediate and \npar�cularly impac�ul approach to reducing arrears lies with those customers who are non -\nincome qualiﬁed. The proposal in the setlement seeks to strike that balance and is meant to be \ncomplementary to those income -qualiﬁed programs.  \n1.49 At the request of Energy CENTS Coali�on, Minnesota Power and the Partners aﬃrm their \nunderstanding that the budget billing provisions in Minnesota Statutes § 216B.098, s u b d i v i s i o n s  2  a n d  3 ,  r e f e r  t o  a l l  r e s i d e n � a l  c u s t o m e r s  a n d  i s  n o t  l i m i t e d  t o  t hose who are \nformally income -qualiﬁed. This is consistent with Minnesota Power’s electric service \nregula�ons and prac�ces. \nS�pula�on 1.49 falls within the category of acknowledgment of exis�ng legal requirements.  \nMinnesota Statutes § 216B.098, subdivisions 2 and 3  require an investor -owned  u�lity to oﬀer \nbudget payment plans and arrearage forgiveness plans to customers that consider  the ﬁnancial \ncircumstances of the customer seeking assistance . In recent proceedings before the Commission, \npar�es have diﬀered on whether  payment plans should be limited only to customers who were \nformally income -qualiﬁed\n3F4 rather than allowing customers to self -declare hardship. While \nMinnesota Power currently complies with the broader interpreta�on of Minnesota Statutes § \n216B.098, subdivisions 2 and 3, S�pula�on 1.49 precludes the Company from invoking a diﬀerent \ninterpreta�on  under new ownership.  \n1.64 The following metrics are �ed to present requirements in Minnesota Power’s annual \nSafety, Reliability, and Service Quality (“SRSQ”) docket. Going forward, changes to Commission rules governing service quality or changes to the metrics in the SRSQ doc ket may also change \nthese metrics, subject to the underperformance payments noted below. Each of the following \nare subject to repor�ng star�ng one year a�er the close of the Acquisi�on and enforcement \nbeginning two years a�er the close of the Acquisi� on:  \n \n4 See Reply Comments of the Joint Commenters at 3.  In the Matter of Northern States Power Company d/b/a \nXcel Energy’s 2023 Annual Safety, Reliability, and Service Quality Report, Docket No. E -002/M -24-27. June 24, \n2024.  \n6 \n a. If Minnesota Power’s statewide service reliability fails to meet or exceed the Ins�tute of \nElectrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”) second quar�le benchmark for medium u�li�es, \nMinnesota Power shall be required to make a $250,000 underperformance payment.  \nb. If one or more of Minnesota Power’s work centers’ reliability fails to meet or exceed the IEEE \nsecond quar�le benchmark for small u�li�es, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a \n$250,000 underperformance payment.  \nc. If the number of non- MN DIP service complaints by Minnesota Power customers forwarded \nto the u�lity from the Commission's Consumer Aﬀairs Oﬃce exceeds ﬁ�y (50) in a given \nrepor�ng year, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a $250,000 underpe rformance \npayment.  \nd. If Minnesota Power fails to grant at least 99 percent of Cold Weather Rule protec�on requests \nwhich meet Minnesota statutory requirements, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a $250,000 underperformance payment.  \ne. If Minnesota Power fails to restore at least 65 percent of involuntarily disconnected, as \ndeﬁned in the Minnesota Rule 7826.1500, residen�al customers to service within 24 hours, \nMinnesota Power shall be required to make a $250,000 underperformance pa yment.  \nf. If Minnesota Power fails to answer at least 80 percent of customer calls received  during \nbusiness hours within 20 seconds, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a $250,000 \nunderperformance payment.  \ng. If  Minnesota Power fails to ensure that at least 99.3 percent of customer invoices are \naccurate, Minnesota Power shall be required to make a $250,000 underperformance payment.  \nh. Fi�y percent of any under -performance payments assessed will be applied to customer bills \nduring the following July billing cycle of a given performance year on an equal rate per kWh for \neach customer; the remaining ﬁ�y percent will be reinvested int o op�ons to address the cause \nof the underperformance . Any bill credit amounts not remited by the end of the July billing \ncycle shall accrue interest beginning a�er the September billing cycle of the applicable year at \na rate equal to that applied to Minnesota Power’s customer deposits.  \ni. Underperformance payments shall not be recoverable from Minnesota Power ratepayers.  \nWhile u�li�es in the State are required to submit Service Quality Reports to the Commission , Xcel \nEnergy is currently the only u�lity that is subjec t to ﬁnancial penal�es if benchmarks are not met. \nThis s�pula�on would apply a similar set of penal�es to Minnesota Power’s performance metrics. Throughout the record, Par�es (including the ALJ)  have posited that the Partners could divest \nfrom opera�ons, maintenance and customer service to sa�sfy an elevated appe�te for proﬁt as \nprivate equity owners.  The concessions the Department secured from  ALLETE and  the Partners  in \n7 \n S�pula�on  1.64 equip the Commission with a regulatory tool with which to shape the Partners ’ \ncost-beneﬁt analysis of any poten�al divestment. In the long run, deep divestment such as would \nbe necessary to secure a meaningful impact on proﬁts would likely lead to diminished customer \nservice and system performance. If maintained properly, the underperformance penalty has the \npoten�al to diminish the gains the Partners  might receive from such a  divestment.   \nIV. Conclusion  \nThe Energy CENTS Coali�on has advocated for low -income u�lity customers for over 30 years. \nOver the course of that tenure, we have engaged in confronta�onal advocacy with u�li�es of \nnearly every ownership type. In 2002,  we interven ed before the Commission on the mater of \nconsumer protec�on viola �ons  by the Beltrami Electric Coopera�ve against members of the \nRed Lake Na�on . 4F5 As recently as 2024, we lobbied before the Commission for a disconnec�on \nmoratorium for CenterPoint Energy in response to a concerning rise in disconnec�ons. 5F6 In short, \nnothing inherent in the ownership structure of any of these en��es precluded the need for vigilance and advocacy on behalf of low -income customers.  \nECC does not deny nor discount that the proﬁt expecta�ons of the Partners  exist in cross -\npurposes with the statutory mandate to provide aﬀordable and reliable u�lity service to low -\nincome customers. Nonetheless, it would appear from examining the historical record that such cross currents  exist in every ownership type.  To the extent that u�li�es have delivered \naﬀordable, equitable and reliable service to Minnesotans of every income, it is  in large part  \nbecause advocates have leveraged the enforcement mechanisms of the regulatory compact to \nensure those outcomes. Vast swaths of the record in this docket are dedicated to specula�ve assessments of mo�ve and intent, both posi�ve and nega�ve. Minnesota Power has stated that it chose the Partners based o n alignment of values.\n6F7 Opponents of the acquisi�on have sought \nto use nego�a�ons over the price of acquisi�on to undermine the credibility of any asser�on of a values -based transac�on.\n7F8  \nECC’s support of the Setlement – and the acquisi�on as a whole  – is not rooted in blind faith in \nthe inten�ons of the Partners . Rather, we see a perennial need for vigilance on behalf of low -\nincome customers within the guardrails and protec�ons of the regulatory compa ct. While there \nis nothing inherent within the transfer to ownership by private equity that will place the Company \noutside the Commission’s watchful eye, the s�pula�ons of the Setlement will further assure \nmeaningful guardrails for MP customers under new ownership.  For that reason, ECC recommends \nthe Commission approve the Setlement.   \n \n \n5 See Docket No. E103/M -02-105  \n6 See Docket No. E, G -999/PR -23-2 \n7 Tr.

We initially supported the transaction \nbecause we believe it is the best path for Minnesota Power to secure the capital needed to \nbuild a safe, reliable and increasingly carbon -free grid using local union labor. Our support has \nonly been strengthened by the set tlement between the DoC, ALLETE, CPPIB, and GIP which \ncomprehensively addresses the concerns raised by opponents and delivers tangible benefits to \nMinnesota  Power customers and the state.  \n \nThe men and women represented by the Minnesota Building Trades have counted on \nMinnesota Power to provide affordable, reliable power and economic opportunity in Northeast \nMinnesota for more than 100 years. During that time, the company’s ownership structur e has \nchanged, but the commitment to customers and union workers has not.  \n \nThe first question Minnesota Building Trades and our affiliated unions asked ourselves after the \nannouncement was how a utility owned by a couple of large infrastructure fund investors might \ndiffer from one owned by Wall Street stockholders. Based on our i nitial review of the proposal \nand our experience with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, we came to the conclusion \nthat the sale would have no impact on the way Minnesota Power operates on a day -to-day \nbasis, while greatly strengthening the utility ’s capacity to attract capital and support badly -\nneeded economic growth in its service territory.  \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST. PAUL,  MN 55102     •      TEL (651) 287- 9999     •     W ww.MnTrades .org \n \n \n \n \n Since that time, Minnesota Building Trades unions and members have participated in the \ncontested case proceedings and public hearings, and nothing we have seen or heard there has \nweakened our conviction that the sale is in the best interest of customers and workers. While \nwe know that change can be scary, nothing about the transaction affects the ability of the Public Utilities Commission to set rates and allowed capital structures, or to approve or deny \ninvestment on the front end or rate and rider recover y on the back end. The controls in place \nafter the transaction will be the same as those that exist today, as will the financial incentive to meet the expectations and requirements established by the Legislature and Public Utilities \nCommission.  \n \nIt’s no secret why ALLETE pursued a private acquisition after more than seven decades as a \npublicly -traded company. In 2023, the State of Minnesota required every utility serving \nMinnesota customers to achieve 100% carbon -free power by 2050. For Minnesota Power, \nwhich relies heavily on coal- fired power despite the utility’s leadership in renewable \ngeneration, meeting that mandate means unprecedented investment in transmission, \nrenewable generation, batteries and other low - and zero -carbon technology. The sc ale of \nneeded investment is far beyond anything ALLETE has done in the past or is capable of doing as a stand -alone company  \n \nThe elected leaders of Minnesota’s Building Trades unions understand the challenge, because \nthey sit on boards that manage hundreds of billions of dollars in pension fund assets and are \naffiliated with international unions that collectively invest more than $500 billion in stocks, bonds, infrastructure, real estate and over investment vehicles. We recognize that a $6 billion \ncompany seeking an additional $5 billion in capital over just five years looks like a potentially \nrisky proposition even before considering Minnesota Power’s unique exposure to risks \nassociated with ebb and flow of mining activity.  \n \nThe Minnesota Building Trades supported Minnesota’s 100% clean energy when it passed in \n2023, despite the fact that achieving the mandate will impact the livelihood of members who \nmaintain coal -fired power plants and other legacy infrastructure. For this r eason, it has been \ndisappointing to see a number of organizations and institutions that say they support climate \nprogress oppose the transaction without providing any realistic alternative for financing \nMinnesota Power’s clean energy transition.  \n \nWe are especially troubled by claims that the utility could meet the need for additional capital \nby relying more on customers, third -party providers or other utilities as suggested by the DoC, \nOffice of the Attorney General and others. While some have trie d to stir up opposition to the  \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST. PAUL,  MN 55102     •      TEL (651) 287- 9999     •     W ww.MnTrades .org \n \n \n \n \n acquisition by inaccurately describing the transfer of a utility from one set of private investors \nto another as “privatization,”\n1 the real threat of deregulation and privatization comes from the \noutsourcing of the utility’s obligation to serve to third parties that are not fully under the \ncontrol and oversight of the Public Utilities Commission.  \n \nMinnesota Power already employs all of  the tools suggested by opposing parties to provide the \nPublic Utilities Commission with a full set of options, and to provide customers with the best \nvalue. Minnesota Power regularly solicits third -party bids for energy generation, encourages \nresidential customers to install rooftop solar and partners with utilities like Great River Energy \nto build and finance transmission projects. But in each case the utility’s capability of delivering these projects on its own helps to ensure that the priorities of the utility’s customers are not \nsubordinated to the interests of third parties.  \n \nMinnesota Power has already experienced the limitations of even modest levels of reliance on \nthird parties. The utility struggled for years to develop a demand response product that was \nacceptable to both large industrial customers and the Public Utilities  Commission due to the \ncost of compensation that customers expected in exchange for curtailing their demand.  \n \nSimilarly, Minnesota Power saw its plan for development of solar generation in the service \nterritory delayed when the low -bidder Cypress Creek failed to deliver the 10 MW Blanchard \nSolar project because the company was unable to secure site control. The ut ility’s solar \nrequirement was only met when Minnesota Power filed a 20 MW self- build proposal, and the \nCommission recently approved an additional 200 MW of utility -built, utility -owned solar in \nCohasset and Royalton as the best option to meet the need iden tified in the current Integrated \nResource Plan. Just today, the utility filed a petition seeking approval to build and own 200 MW \nof wind in North Dakota utilizing Minnesota Power’s upgraded HVDC line. Like Boswell and \nRegal Solar, Longspur Wind emerged as  the lowest -cost option for utility customers  \n \nIf Minnesota Power is unable to secure adequate capital to continue proposing utility -financed \nprojects or to do so cost -effectively, customers and the public interest will suffer in important \nways. The potential consequences of a capital shortage are pote ntially severe. Capital shortfalls \ncould create deployment delays that could threaten the utility’s ability to meet requirements, \nmaintain reliability and/or take advantage of favorable market conditions and avoid \nunfavorable conditions. Further capital shortfalls will almost certainly result in higher costs for  \n \n \n1 https://curemn.org/blog/take -the-power -back/   \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST. PAUL,  MN 55102     •      TEL (651) 287- 9999     •     W ww.MnTrades .org \n \n \n \n \n customers by reducing competition and giving third parties more leverage to extract premiums \nin cases where the utility could have provided a more cost -effective option.  \n Workers will also suffer from capital constraints, first, as a result of project cancellations and \ndelays; and second, because capital shortfalls will limit Minnesota Power’s ability to set and \nenforce requirements that advance the workers’ interests and t he state’s values. A decade ago, \nlarge wind and solar energy projects built to serve Minnesota utilities created very few jobs for \nunion or local workers, as documented by North Star Policy Institute and  Local Jobs North \nbecause the third- party developers responsible for construction hired contractors that relied \nheavily on non -union out- of-state workforce.\n2  \n \nToday, similar projects are creating hundreds of jobs for union and local workforce, in large part \nbecause utilities like Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power began to simultaneously pursue more \nself-build projects, and to make use of local and/or union labor a  requirement for Power \nPurchase Agreement providers that were previously reluctant to make any such commitments. \nNeither utility could have moved the market without having the option of building their own \nprojects if third -party providers balked. The same is true for efforts to increase participation of \npeople of color, women and veterans in the workforce and as vendors, which have made much \ngreater strides through utility -owned than through third -party -owned projects. This risk is not \njust hypothetical: in Minnesota Power’s Longspur Wind petition, the utility identifies difficulty \nsecuring assurances on labor protections as a problem in dealings with one or more potential PPA providers.\n3 \n \nThe dynamic is even worse for customer- owned generation, where the state’s values in the \narea of fair compensation, respect for workers’ rights, and workforce inclusion play little or no \nrole, because neither the utility nor the Public Utilities Commission  can easily tell customers \nhow to build their own projects. As a result, industries such as rooftop solar installation are dominated by low -wage work and lack the sort of inclusive career pathways adopted by \nBuilding Trades unions. Given the poor economies  of scale associated with most distributed \ngeneration projects, increasing Minnesota Power’s reliance on them would push up rates,  \n \n2 https://northstarpolicy.org/catching- the-wind -the-impact -of-local -vs-non-local -hiring- practices -on-construction -\nof-minnesota -wind -farms/ ; https://www.localjobsnorth.org/reports   \n3  “The Company initially intended to announce multiple selected projects as a portfolio, however, negotiations \nstalled and material changes occurred in the project list including inability to provide certain assurances on labor \nand cost protections  to maintain that project’s compliance with fundamental requirements of the approved RFP \nterms.” (Emphasis added) https://www.edockets.state.mn.us/documents/%7BE0367698 -0000 -CE10 -9781 -\n01A328D04471%7D/download?contentSequence=0&rowIndex=1    \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST. PAUL,  MN 55102     •      TEL (651) 287- 9999     •     W ww.MnTrades .org \n \n \n \n \ntransfer wealth from lower to higher -income customers best able to take advantage of these \nprograms, and exchange high -quality jobs on utility -scale projects for lower- quality jobs on \ndistributed projects. The proposed transaction will help to ensure that MInnesota Power \ncustomers are never forced to overpay for energy resources owned by third parties that take our money but won’t live up to our values.  \n \nThe agreement between the ALLETE, investors and DoC improves greatly upon a transaction \nthat already advanced the public interest, turning a home run into a Grand Slam. The \nsettlement includes more than a dozen significant concessions on the part of ALLETE  and \ninvestors, including a reduction in the utility’s Return on Equity, a one -year moratorium on rate \nincreases, new service quality penalties, the addition of independent directors to ALLETE’s \nboard, strict limits on the ability of investors to issue div idends, and a $50 million investor- paid \nclean energy advancement fund. These terms represent substantial public benefits and they \nshould resolve any remaining concern that ownership by private infrastructure funds could \nsomehow destabilize Minnesota  Power’s finances or undermine the Commission’s ability to \noversee and regulate the utility’s operations.  \n \nGiven the clear necessity for better access to capital and the robust framework negotiated with \nthe DoC, it is disappointing that the Administrative Law Judge not only failed to grasp the public \ninterest case for the transaction but doesn’t seem to have tried. To the contrary, the ALJ seems \nto have gone out of her way to exclude every inconvenient fact, bit of testimony and public comment from her summary of the record. As one example among many, the ALJ wholly \nignores the direct and  rebuttal testimony of L IUNA expert witness Erin Bryant, while treating \nthe testimony of an opposing witness with less relevant experience as gospel truth.  \n \nWhere she was unable to simply exclude information favorable to the transaction, such as in \nher summary of public comments, the ALJ denigrates its value by attacking the motive and \ncompetence of supporters. Her claim that supporters largely repeated compan y talking points \nand her suggestion that many may have been inappropriately influenced by the utility clearly demonstrate her lack of respect not just for supporters – including many Building Trades \nmembers – but for the public process. The Minnesota Building Trades and our affiliated unions \nhave participated in hundreds of public hearings and comment processes through the years, and we have never  seen a state official responsible for conducting the proceeding demonstrate \nthis level of bias or contempt for the public. Given the ALJ’s conduct and choice to exclude \nevidence that she found disagreeable from the record, we do not believe any weight sho uld be \ngiven to her findings, conclusions or recommendations. While in our experience Commissioners always do th eir own homework, in this case they need to do so without any assistance from the \nALJ in order to get an objective picture of the case.  \n \nDan McConnell , President         •  DON MULLIN , Secretary  Treasurer         •  TOM DICKLICH , Executive  Director  \n           353 W. 7th STREET, ROOM 103, ST. PAUL,  MN 55102     •      TEL (651) 287- 9999     •     W ww.MnTrades .org \n \n \n \n \nIt is clear to us that approval of the proposed transaction will bring significant benefits to \nMinnesota Building Trades members in the form of more and lower- cost investments in job -\ncreating projects, coupled with preservation of the utility’s ability to provide the capital needed \nto provide safe, reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean power. And pursuant to the agreement negotiated by the DoC, Building Trades members served by Minnesota Power will \nalso benefit from lower electric rates, better prote ctions and debt forgiveness for those who \nhave fallen behind.  \n \nOn the other hand, a decision to deny approval could have catastrophic consequences, \ndestroying job opportunities on upcoming projects and forcing the utility to spend more money \nchasing capital and less keeping rates affordable and service reliable. In th e face of possible \nrecession, trade wars, and Federal actions that seem designed to make our electricity dirtier and more expensive, we cannot afford to gamble Northern Minnesota on speculative and half -\nbaked suggestions that Minnesota Power can get by pinching pennies and leaving \ninfrastructure build -out to others. We ask the Commission to make the right choice and \napprove the transaction, and we thank you for your time and consideration.  \n \nThank you,  \n Tom Dicklich  \nExecutive Director  \nMN Building and Construction Trades Council"

INTRODUCTION \n On Friday afternoon, July 11, 2025, two business days prior to the  anticipated  issuance of \nthe Administrative Law Judge’s (“ALJ”) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and \nRecommendations (“ALJ Findings”)  in this proceeding, the Department of Commerce \n(“Department”), Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investments, and Global Infrastructure Partners (together, “the Partners”), jointly filed (as the “Settling Parties”)  a proposed settlement \nstipulation (“Settlement”), in the above -captioned docket.  The Settlement purports to offer “a \nseries of additional commitments resp onsive to issues and concerns raised by the Department that \nensure that the Acquisition is consistent with the public interest.”\n2  LPI is troubled by this \ncharacterization, and the corresponding social media efforts by the Partners  to advance the \n \n2  Settlement Stipulation Between the Minnesota Department of Commerce, ALLETE, Inc. d/b/a \nMinnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Global Infrastructure Partners at 2  (Jul. 11, \n2025) (eDocket No. 20257- 220879- 01) (“Settlement Stipulation”) .  \n3 \n Settlement, which are simply  more statements that are entirely inconsistent with the record , that \nthe Commission should disregard.3   \nTo be sure , the record developed over the course of a year demonstrates that  the proposed \nSettlement includes little, if any, incremental benefit to the list of commitments the Partners agreed \nto over the course of the proceeding  and included in the Partners’ proposed findings submitted to \nthe ALJ .  These commitments were not persuasive to six  of the Parties then, and five  of the \nIntervenors now .  Nor were they persuasive to the ALJ, which the ALJ addressed  in detail in the \nALJ Findings.  T he Settlement is , in fact, s ubstantively and legally flawed by largely restating \nCommitments rejected in the 283 Findings of Fact that the ALJ made after a year of record \ndevelopment and evidentiary proceedings that concluded the proposed Acquisition is not in the public interest.  Furthermore, the Settlement is procedurally flawed, especially considering that the Settling Parties refused to respond to LPI’s requests for information regarding its benefits.  Even \nif the Commission sees some benefit to the Settlement the likes of which LPI does not, no record \nexists upon which the Settlement could be approved.  The Commission should therefore deny  it \nand the proposed Acquisition, and require Minnesota Power to provide an accounting of the cost \nincurred pursuing the transaction.   \n \n3  See, e.g., ALJ Findings  (Public)  at 38, P 180, n.339 (“At various times throughout this proceeding, \nMinnesota Power has insisted that the Petitioner’s “intent” or “understanding” is different than what is \nreflect in the written documents.  This is one such example.  Minnesota Power’s apparent reliance on \nunenforceable “understandings” which conflict with the written record is, at best, naïve.  Sophisticated \nparties, like the Partners, engaging in complex transactions, like the Acquisition, rely on written \nagreements.  The Commission should do the same. ”) (emphasis added)  \n4 \n II.  ANALYSIS  \nA. The Settlement as Proposed is Not Consistent with the Public Interest . \nMinnesota Statute § 216B.50 requires Commission authorization for any public utility to \n“sell, acquire, lease, or rent any plant as an operating unit or system in this state for a total \nconsideration in excess of $1,000,000, or merge or consolidate with another public utility or \ntransmission company operating in this state.”  As noted by the ALJ, the longstanding requirement \nto obtain this approval is for the petitioners  to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \nthe proposed transaction “is consistent with the Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 public interest standard.”4  \nFurther, if the Commission finds the proposed action consistent with the public interest, § 216B.50 requires “it shall give its consent and approval ….”   In applying that standard, the Commission has \nsought evidence of tangible benefits to ratepayers.\n5  While the Partners advocate for a lower \nstandard, the ALJ correctly concludes , in recommending rejection of the Proposed Acquisition:  \nThe parties have argued that the public interest requires the  \nCommission find that the deal either produces net benefits or, \nalternatively, avoids net  harm. The proposed deal is inconsistent \nwith the public interest under either standar d because it results in net \nharm to the public interest.6 \nTherefore, LPI review s the marginal additional commitments offered in the Settlement \nthrough the same lens – that is, regardless of the interpretation of how to satisfy the public interest \n \n4  ALJ’s Findings  and Recommendations  (Public), at 60, P 11. (citing Minn. Stat. § 216B.50; Minn. \nR. 1400.7399 subp. 5).  \n5  E.g., In the Matter of Otter Tail Power Company’s Petition for Approval of a Transfer of Property, \nMPUC Docket No. E -017/PA -21-793, Order Approving Petition and Requiring Compliance Filing at 3- 4 \n(Oct. 24, 2022); In the Matter of Proposed Merger of Minnegasco, Inc. with and into Arkla, Inc., MPUC \nDocket No. G -008/PA -90-604, Order Approving Merger and Adopting Amended Stipulation with \nModifications at 4 (Nov. 27, 1990); In the Matter of the Application of Northern States Power Company \nfor Approval to Merge with New Century Energies, Inc. , MPUC Docket No. E, G -002/PA -99-1031, Order \nApproving Merger, As Conditioned at 11- 12 (Jun. 12, 2000).  \n6  ALJ’s Findings  and Recommendations  (Public)  at 61, P 15 (citing Minn. Stat. § 216B.50 subd. 1).  \n5 \n standard under Minnesota law, whether the Settlement meets even the low bar of eliminating harm \nto the public interest.  For reasons further explained below, the Settlement does not offset the harms \nof the Proposed Acquisition or  offer anything not already required by Minnesota law.   \nAdditionally, the Settlement fails to explicitly address the questions addressed to the Administrative Law Judge in the Commission’s Order of October 7, 2024, in this docket. \nB. The Conditions Proposed in the Settlement are Repetitive of Those Rejected in the \nALJ Findings, Inadequate to Offset Harms Associated with the Proposed Acquisition, and Fail to Offer Material Benefits to Ratepayers. \nThe Settlement offers only incremental changes from the Partners’ initial offer and overall \nlittle value to ratepayers.  The Department claims the  Settlement includes “more than 70 discrete \nterms” and is “broadly responsive to concerns identified by the Department during the contested -\ncase proceeding .”\n7  Footnote 3 of the Settlement includes a list of terms that “were negotiated by \nthe Settling Parties for purposes of this comprehensive Settlement Stipulation.”8  The footnote \nconcedes that  the remaining terms constitute those already offered in the course of testimony.  In \nother words, despite claiming “more than 70 discrete terms” benefiting ratepayers were included \nin the S ettlement, more than 30 of those terms were agreed to by the Partners and offered for the \nALJ’s consideration.  Additionally, the Settlement does not account for the fact that the terms not \ndescribed in footnote 3 (i.e., the more than 30 terms agreed to by the Partners), have all be systematically critique d or rejected in the ALJ Findings as insufficient, already required by law, \n \n7  Letter at 1 (Jul. 11, 2025) (eDocket No. 20257-220879-02). \n8  Settlement Stipulation at 2, n.3.  \n6 \n or offering no benefits to ratepayers.9  Overall , the terms in footnote 3 fail to  provide sufficient \nbenefits to outweigh the ALJ-identified harms of the Proposed Acquisition.  \nPursuant to the Settlement Stipulation, the only incremental differences from previous \nofferings are settlement terms: 1.4- 1.6, 1.9, 1.12- 1.14, 1.17- 1.30, 1.32- 1.36, 1.38, 1.40- 1.46, 1.56, \n1.63- 1.64, and 1.73- 1.74.10  As noted in the table  below, each “new” or “modified” term remains \neither  insufficient, already required by law, or provides  no benefit to ratepayers.  \nSettlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.4 Alloy Parent has already committed to provide this type of equity financing \nas part of the Proposed Acquisition.  Adding that dividends will not be paid \nout until such equity financing materializes does not change the \nfundamental commitment and offers nothing new to ratepayers.11 \n1.5 The Settlement term is not materially different from what the Company \nalready committed to, stating “[t] he Company will provide compliance \nfilings on equity infusions from and dividends to Alloy Parent in the same \nmanner in which the Company currently provides compliance filings in its capital structure docket. ”\n12 \n1.6 This Settlement commitment matches identically what was offered in the \nJoint Proposed Findings, which stated “ The Company commits to not make \nany dividend or distributions unless at least  one senior unsecured credit \nrating is investment grade or above. ”13 \n \n9  See LPI Exceptions to the ALJ’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations  \n(Aug. 4, 2025).  \n10  Settlement Stipulation at 2, n.3.  \n11  Joint Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation to Approve the \nAcquisition at Attachment A, pg. 1 of 11 (Commitment 1)  (May 29, 2025) (eDocket No. 2255- 219382- 02) \n(“Joint Proposed Findings”).  \n12  Joint Proposed Findings at 81 (May 29, 2025) (citing Ex. MP -35 at 13- 14 (Anderson Rebuttal)).  \n13  Joint Proposed Findings at Attachment A, pg. 1 of 11 ( Commitment 4 ). \n7 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.9 This Settlement commitment matches identically to what was already \noffered in the Proposed Joint Findings, that “ ALLETE will not make any \ndividend or distribution that would cause the actual  equity ratio of \nMinnesota Power to be outside the range approved by the  Commission.”14 \n1.12 Minnesota Power has already committed that “ Minnesota Power and the \nPartners have committed that if, as a result of the Acquisition, Minnesota \nPower’s cost of debt increases above current levels within three years \nfollowing the close of the Acquisition, customers will be held harmless \nfrom any rate impact. ”15  Adding two years to the commitment (i.e., bring \nit to five years following the close of the Acquisition), hardly constitutes a \nmaterial or new benefit.  \n1.13 This Settlement commitment matches identically to Commitment 37 in the \nProposed Joint Findings.16 \n1.14 The commitment to lower Minnesota Power’s return on equity (“ROE”) to \n9.65 percent until it is next eligible for a rate case, effective the first full month after the close of the Acquisition and issuance a final Commission order, provides very little reli ef to ratepayers.  \nConsidering a final \nCommission order is not expected until the first quarter of 2026, and \nMinnesota Power will become eligible for a rate case in November 2026 (per term 1.43), this commitment offers at most 10 months of benefits to ratepayers.  \n1.17 Minnesota Power and the Partners have already agreed to prohibitions on \nloans or pledges of assets of ALLETE without regulatory approval.17 \n \n14  Joint Proposed Findings at Attachment A, pg. 1 of 11 ( Commitment 3 ). \n15  Joint Proposed Findings at 43 (citing Ex. MP -29 at 22 (Taran Rebuttal), Ex. MP -33 at 34- 35 (Bram \nRebuttal)).  \n16  Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 6 of 11 ( Commitment 37 ). \n17  Proposed Joint Findings at 45.  \n8 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.18 The Petitioners have already committed to, verbatim, “ maintain separate \nbooks and records, agree to prohibitions against loans or pledges of assets \nof ALLETE without regulatory approval, and generally hold ALLETE \nharmless from any business and financial risk exposures associated with \nAlloy Parent or its subsi diaries or affiliates (other than any subsidiary of \nALLETE) .”18  \n1.19 The Petitioners have already made this commitment verbatim: “ Neither \nALLETE nor Alloy Parent shall provide direct credit support to a credit facility of the other through a guarantee, and none of ALLETE’s credit facilities shall include any cross -default provision whereby a default under \nany of Alloy Parent’s credit  facilities would cause a default under any of \nALLETE’s credit facilities [.]”\n19 \n1.20 While this term represents a new commitment, it is industry -standard to \nprovide a non -consolidation opinion in the merger or acquisition of a public \nutility.20  \n1.21 Minnesota Power and the Partners have already committed that “ Minnesota \nPower will be prohibited from loaning funds to or borrowing funds from  its \nAlloy parent or other upstream entities.”21 \n1.22 Minnesota Power and the Partners have already committed that “ Alloy \nParent will not use utility assets to guarantee Alloy Parent debt. ” The \nalteration of the commitment such that Minnesota Power is prohibited from \nguaranteeing any obligations of its nonutility affiliates represents an \nincremental benefit to ratepayers at best.  \n \n18  Proposed Joint Findings at 45.  \n19  Proposed Joint Findings at 45.  \n20  E.g., In the Matter of the Joint Application of Puget Holdings LLC and Puget Sound Energy, INC., \nFor an Order Authorizing Proposed Transaction, Docket U072375, Order 08 Approving and Adopting \nSettlement Stipulation; Authorizing Transaction Subject to Conditions at 154 (December 30, 2008).  \n21  Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 2 of 11 (Commitment 10) .  \n9 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.23 The governance commitment presented in the Settlement materially \nconforms to what is presented in the Proposed Joint Findings, save the \naddition of a single board member.  Furthermore, the addition of a single board member does not change the fact that the  Partners as a whole will \nselect a majority of the board seats (10 of 14).\n22  Nor does the commitment \nin 1.23 (a) eliminate the ability of this Partner -selected board from \ninfluencing, modifying, or rejecting any of the budgets, proposals, strategic plans, or regulatory filings “developed” by Minnesota Power.  \n1.24 While the commitment that “[t] he Audit Committee of the Board will \nconsist of Board directors not employed by any of ALLETE, GIP, or CPP \nInvestments ” represents a new commitment and provides some benefits to \nratepayers in terms of transparency and control, it is not substantial enough \nto uproot a finding that the Proposed Acquisition is not in the public \ninterest.  \n1.25 This commitment is already required by Minnesota Law, as the term itself \nstates.  A benefit to ratepayers cannot exist where an action would be \nrequired of Minnesota Power and the Partners with or without the \ncommitment.  \n1.26 This commitment does not offer a benefit to ratepayers.  It simply states \nwhich document  will serve as definitive governance documentation. \n1.27 Minnesota Power and the Partners’ commitment to separate non -regulated \nutility entities from the current ALLETE d/b/a Minnesota Power entity \nupon the Acquisition’s closing may offer some benefits to ratepayers, but would also be subject to recoverability, this leaving ratepayers with rate increases that they would not have to endure but -\nfor the Proposed \nAcquisition.23 \n1.28 This commitment does not assuage concerns about control of Minnesota \nPower given a majority of the board will be comprised of directors selected by the Partners.  \n \n22  See Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 2 of 11 (Commitment Commitments 11 -14).  \n23  Settlement at 6 (“the costs associated with the petition or separation efforts will not be considered \ntransaction or transition costs of the Acquisition but recoverability will be determined in the course of the \nseparation proceeding.” ). \n10 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.29 Minnesota Power has already committed to these exact requirements, \nexcept now it will identify contracts over $500,000 (rather than $1 million) \nwith an entity identified pursuant to the immediately preceding \ncommitment and notify the Commission within 30 d ays of contract \nexecution.  The lowering of the amount by $500,000 provides no material \nbenefit to ratepayers, as is certainly not significant enough to offset the \nProposed Acquisition’s potential harms. \n1.30 While the commitment to subject Minnesota Power’s annual affiliate \ninterest report to an annual Agreed Upon Procedures audit by independent third -\nparty auditors is new, it represents a simple modification to an \nunderlying commitment, and does not provide e nough of a ratepayer \nbenefit to offset potential harms. \n1.32 ALLETE is  already  required to keep its books in accordance with the \nCommission’s Uniform System of Accounts.24  This commitment proposes \nnothing beyond what is already required by FERC.  \n1.33 This Commitment has already been offered verbatim in the Proposed Joint \nFindings.25 \n1.34 While this commitment goes a step beyond one already offered, that \n“Minnesota Power will continue to provide ALLETE credit rating reports to the Commission within 30 days of receipt of the reports from the rating agencies[,]” it does not substantially help \noutweigh the Proposed \nAcquisition’s potential harms.  \n1.35 Because ALLETE and Alloy Parent entities are already subject to audit, \nand thus must already maintain their books  and records in a form that can \ndistinguish costs allocable to Minnesota Power, this commitment does not constitute an explicit new benefit for ratepayers.  \n \n24  ALLETE, Inc., On Behalf of Itself and Its Public Utility Subsidiaries, Docket No. EC24- 105, \nApplication for Authorization under Section 203 of the FPA of ALLETE, Inc. at Attachment 2 (Jul. 19, \n2024).  \n25  Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, p g. 6 of 11 (“Partners commit to providing the \nDepartment and Commission with access to all books and records of the entities up to and including Alloy \nParent that are related to Minnesota Power's operations under the jurisdiction of the Commission.” \n(Commitment 42 ).  \n11 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.36 This commitment is at best an incremental addition to the commitment \nalready made by Minnesota Power and the Partners to provide “[a] ccess to \nthe books and records of the entities up to and including Alloy Parent that \nare related to Minnesota Power’s operations under the jurisdiction of the Commission will be provided to the Commission after the Acquisition .”\n26 \n1.38 This commitment is at best an incremental addition to the commitment \nalready made by Minnesota Power and the Partners that “[t] he Company’s \nannual capital structure petition will include full audited consolidated \nfinancial statements for ALLETE, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Principles (“GAAP”).  \nThese will include all of the \nfootnotes, as well as specific supplemental schedules that are currently \nincluded in ALLETE’s Forms 10- K and 10- Q.”27 \n1.40 This term has repeatedly been offered as a commitment throughout this \nproceeding (i.e., not to recover Acquisition, transaction, transition costs, or an acquisition premium, from customers).\n28 \n1.41 This commitment identically matches one offered prior to the Settlement.29 \n1.42 This commitment does not represent a real benefit to customers.  But-for \nthe Proposed Acquisition, ratepayers would not be subject to or responsible \nfor costs associated with the formation of a Holding Company, and thus \nratepayers should not be forced to bear those costs. \n1.43 The commitment for Minnesota Power to waive its right to file a rate case \nbefore November 1, 2026 does not offer substantive relief to ratepayers.  \nBy the time these commitments will become effective (i.e., upon \nCommission Order authorizing the proposed Acquisition), it would be early 2026, and this commitment would provide at most 10 months of relief.  \n \n26  Proposed Joint Findings at 81 (citing Ex. MP -35 at 14 (Anderson Rebuttal)).  \n27  Proposed Joint Findings at 81 (citing Ex. MP -35 at 13- 14 (Anderson Rebuttal)).  \n28  E.g., Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 3 of 11 ( Commitments 17, 18) . \n29  Proposed Joint Findings at Attachment A, pg. 4 of 11 (Commitment 27 ). \n12 \n Settlement  \nTerm  Reason Term is Insufficient, Already Required by Law, or Provides \nNo Benefit to Ratepayers  \n1.44 While this commitment may provide slight transparency, it is not \nsomething ratepayers could not already request in the course of a typical \nrate case.  As such, the commitment does not provide much benefit to \nratepayers.  \n1.45 Minnesota Power is already crediting  “the difference between the book \nvalue and the sale price to Minnesota Power customer s.”30  Committing to \nprovide a plan for continuing to do so within 60 days of the Acquisition’s \napproval makes no guarantees as to when ratepayers would actually see \nthose credits.  Without more certainty, this commitment does not materially benefit ratepayers.  \n1.46 Issues with this commitment mirror those with 1.45.  The commitment \nmakes no guarantee as to when ratepayers would actually see these credits.  \n1.56 This commitment is required by law.  Minnesota Power does not confer on \nratepayers an explicit benefit when it complies with Minnesota law.  \n1.63 If the Partners can commit $50 million in funds to a “Clean Firm \nTechnology Fund,” they should also provide a standalone rate credit to \nratepayers.  \n1.64 The utility is already required to comply with the listed service quality \nreporting requirements.  The offering of an underperformance payment \ndoes not quell the concerns of ratepayers regarding the effects the Proposed Acquisition may have on service quality.  Once again, Minnesota Power \noffers as a commitment something it is required by the Commission to do anyway.  \n1.73 This commitment is simply a fact.  It does not constitute a benefit to \nratepayers.   \n1.74 Like term 1.73, this commitment simply describes the jurisdiction of the \nCommission and subsequent appeal process, and does not constitute a \nbenefit to ratepayers.  \n \n \n30  In the Matter of the Petition for Approval of Minnesota Power Land Sales , Docket No. E015/PA -\n20-675, Petition for Approval at 9 (Aug. 31, 2020).  \n13 \n Among all the new terms offered, only three provide any material  relief to ratepayers, relief \nwhich is nominal at best: the creation of the Clean Firm Technology Fund, which will provide $50 \nmillion in funds toward Minnesota Power’s integrated resource plan dockets;31 a reduction in \nMinnesota Power’s authorized ROE from 9.78% to 9.65%; and a commitment not to file a rate case before November 1, 2026.\n32  These three commitments are entirely insufficient to overcome \nthe net harm resulting from the Proposed Acquisition. \nWith respect to the Clean Firm Technology Fund, LPI emphasizes that the $50 million \npledge is neither immediate nor indicative of a ratepayer benefit.  To be sure, the pledge is over a period of at least four years because the amounts are paid in instalments.\n33  Furthermore, the \ncommitment to not seek cost recovery may not be a commitment at all and instead could simply be a commitment by the Partners to seek cost recovery from federal or state sources.\n34  Had \nMinnesota Power and the Partners been interested in putting their own money towards benefiting ratepayers, they could have done so via a rate credit proposal, which is a common commitment for proceedings such as the Proposed Acquisition.\n35  And t he latter commitments do not amount to a \n \n31  Settlement Stipulation at 11 (see term 1.63).  \n32  Settlement Stipulation at 9 (see term 1.43).  \n33  Settlement Stipulation at 11 -12 (see term 1.43).  \n34  As the Commission is well -aware, the U.S. Department of Energy is working to disperse federal \nfunding for clean energy infrastructure, which the Minnesota Department of Commerce is working to \nimplement.  See  https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/clean-energy- infrastructure -funding-projects-and-\nprograms ; https://mn.gov/commerce/energy/industry- government/federal-funding-opportunities/ .  \n35  See, In the Matter of the Joint Application of Puget Holdings LLC and Puget Sound Energy, INC., \nFor an Order Authorizing Proposed Transaction, Docket U -072375, Order 08 Approving and Adopting \nSettlement Stipulation ; Authorizing Transaction Subject to Conditions at P 93 (December 30, 2008) \n(committing to rate credit totaling $100 million).  \n14 \n rate credit.  These commitments will not become effective until a final order has been issued by \nthe Commission, effectively capping the impacts of any perceived benefits to around 10 months.36   \nTaken together, the new commitments provided in the Settlement are insufficient to \noutweigh the tremendous potential harms that accompany the Proposed Acquisition.  Additionally, \nthe ALJ Findings noted the settlement did not assuage the ALJ’s  concerns about the Proposed \nAcquisition and did not change her ultimate recommendation: that the MPUC “disapprove the Acquisition.”\n37  The Settlement Stipulation provides only slight deviations to the commitments \nproposed throughout the proceeding, which time and time again have proven unsatisfactory to \noffset the potential harms of the Proposed Acquisition.  Therefore , LPI cannot support the \nSettlement.  \nC. Other Issues or Concerns – Settling Parties’ Refusal to Engage with LPI Discovery \nOnly Exacerbates Its Transparency Concerns . \nUpon receipt of the Settlement, LPI had reasonable and material questions related to the  \nSettlement’s terms, the Department’s analysis to substantiate ALLETE’s claimed need for a “$5 billion capital plan,” modeling around the estimated benefit to ratepayers from the Clean Firm Technology Fund, and other questions.\n38  Citing a discovery deadline contained in one of the ALJ’s \nprehearing orders, t he Settling Parties refused to engage and were not  willing to respond to basic \ndiscovery to ease concerns around how the procedural posture of the Settlement, or  what it offered \n \n36  Settlement Stipulation at 4 (see terms 1.14, 1.43) (estimating that a Commission final order will \nnot be produced until early 2026).  \n37  ALJ’s Findings  and Recommendations  at 73.  \n38  Appendix A contains the information requests issued by LPI. \n15 \n distinct from existing commitments that had been previously unacceptable to the Department.39    \nThe Department’s and Partner’s position is extremely disappointing.  The discovery deadline was \nset at the beginning of the contested case process, as a common practice to limit discovery and distraction during the evidentiary hearings.  None of the part ies anticipated the production of new \ninformation, let alone a proposed settlement on the eve of ALJ Findings, well after the conclusion of the evidentiary hearings.  Parties should not be precluded from asking questions related to a new, substantive document introduced after evidentiary hearings have concluded.  The Partners \nbear the burden of proof in this proceeding.  By not responding, the Partners are underscoring their \ninability to meet this burden.  Furthermore, the Partners’  refusal to engage with L PI regarding its \nquestions only perpetuates the litigious and untransparent practices the Partners exhibited during the proceeding and exacerbates LPI’s concerns around transparency and the willingness of the \nPartners to work with Minnesota Power customers moving forward.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons provided herein above, t he Settlement is procedurally and legally flawed \nand fails to rescue the Proposed Acquisition from being entirely inconsistent with the public \ninterest .  Absent the Partners coming forward with material ratepayer protections, LPI cannot \nsupport the Settlement.  As drafted, the Settlement does not comport with the public interest and \nshould be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n39  Included as Appendix B is the Department’s letter declining to respond to LPI’s information \nrequests.  Included as Appendix C is Minnesota Power’s letter declining to response to LPI’s information \nrequests.   \n16 \n Dated:  August 4, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \n \n STOEL RIVES LLP  \n /s/ Andrew P.

E -015/PA -24-198 \nDear Mr. Moratzka:  \nOn July 14, 2025, the Large Power Intervenors served the Department of Commerce with \ndiscovery requests 500 through 504 in connection with the above -referenced matter . These \nrequests, however, are untimely. The deadline for serving discovery was March 26, 2025. (First \nPrehearing Order ¶ 12.) Moreover, the Minnesota chapter 1400 rules that would otherwise permit \nLPI to engage in timely discovery are no longer applicable given that jurisdiction over the matter \nhas returned to the Public Utilities Commission. See Minn. R. 1400.8300 ; Minn. Admin. Proc. § \n7.4.1 (3rd ed.). Finally, even if LPI’s  discovery was timely and permitted by the applicable rules , \nseveral questions attempt to obtain privileged work -product or otherwise inadmissible settlement \ncommunications . \nAlthough the Department will not be responding to LPI’s untimely discovery, the \nDepartment appreciates that there is great interest in the stipulation and questions about how the \nSettling Parties intend for various provisions to be construed. LPI, for example, asked the \nDepartment which stipulation provisions are new,  and which were previously proposed by \nPetitioners. That information can be found in footnote three of the stipulation . In another instance, \nLPI asked the Department about the composition of the post -Acquisition board. To clarify, the  \nboard will have fourteen  directors. The Partners will select ten directors based on their respective \nownership  interests . The Partners will select three directors by agreement . The final director will \nbe ALLETE’s CEO. Of the thirteen non -CEO directors, six of them will meet the NYSE’s \ndefinition of independence and the Partners will appoint the remaining seven directors to represent \ntheir respective interests  consistent with their fiduciary obligations to ALLETE under Minnesota \nlaw.  \nIf LPI has  other questions about the meaning of stipulation provisions, please contact me \nby telephone  or e-mail.

Further, several of your questions appear to \nseek legal conclusions, which would not be appropriate to provide through a \ndiscovery/information request process. \nThe Petitioners recognize, however, that there is substantial interest in the settlement, \nand that several of your questions appear to seek information about what the settlement \nmeans or how it works. More generally, we are pleased to provide the information below \nin order to address and resolve your questions.  \nAs we first reviewed your questions, we identified that the language in the agreement \naddresses a number of the questions raised. For example, with respect to a comparison \nof the settlement terms to other commitments in this matter, that information is included \nin the settlement in Footnote 3, which highlights additional benefits from the settlement \nbeyond those previously offered by Petitioners, such as service quality commitments, a \nLPI Initial Comment on Proposed Settlement \nAppendix C \nPage 1\nMr. Moratzka \nJuly 24, 2025 \nPage 2 \n  \n  $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund, and enhancements to other commitments, \nsuch as enforceability, to name a few.  \n \nYou also asked for information regarding the state resident independent directors, which \nis described in Section 1.23 of the settlement. As explained there, ten directors will be \nappointed by the Partners with each Partner having the right to appoint one director to \nthe Board for every 10 percent ownership of ALLETE, Inc., three directors will be \nappointed by agreement among the Partners, and the last seat will be filled by the CEO. \nThe CEO’s board seat will not count as a director from the State of Minnesota or State \nof Wisconsin, so the non-CEO directors must include state resident directors to satisfy \nthe terms of the settlement.1  \n \nOther questions you have raised focus on the scope of the Commission’s regulation of \nMinnesota Power or related matters. The settlement includes a number of commitments \nthat recognize, and are consistent with, key regulatory principles, while building on \nthose principles to provide further benefits to customers.  For example, with respect to \nyour questions regarding the Company’s capital plans, as you are aware, the \nCommission does not approve capital plans. Rather, it is and will continue to be the \nobligation of the utility (as with other Minnesota utility companies) to develop, finance, \nand execute a capital plan, and the Commission reviews the prudence of any regulated \ninvestments the utility proposes to make via resource plans, certificates of need, rate \ncases, and other cost recovery proceedings. That said, the settlement provides an \nenforceable commitment to provide capital to support Minnesota Power’s 5-year capital \ninvestment plan, subject to such prospective reasonable and prudent plan adjustments.  \n \nIn addition, Commitment 1.12 in the settlement expressly addresses debt-related \nconcerns raised by parties to the proceeding.  Furthermore, it remains the case that the \nutility will have the burden to prove that its proposed cost of debt is reasonable and that \nits proposed cost of equity is appropriate, based upon market data and analysis \navailable at the time, in any future rate proceeding. This also means other parties will \nhave the opportunity to provide their own views on reasonable authorized levels of debt, \ncapital structure, and rates of return, and the Commission will ultimately make those \ndecisions for Minnesota Power. Commitments 1.12 and 1.41 build on these existing \nprinciples and require Minnesota Power to prove the absence of transaction-related cost \nof debt increases and other costs, respectively. These commitments are distinct from \nand in addition to the standard burden of proof.  \n \nWe also wanted to note that Commitment 1.33, related to access to books and records \nof Minnesota Power, expands on existing requirements for Minnesota Power by \n \n1 In addition, the New York Stock Exchange definition of “independent,” as set forth in NYSE Rule 303A.01, which \nwill apply to certain of the directors as set forth in the settlement, can be found on its website, located here: \nhttps://nyseguide.srorules.com/listed-company-manual/09013e2c8503fca9 .   \nLPI Initial Comment on Proposed Settlement \nAppendix C \nPage 2\nMr. Moratzka \nJuly 24, 2025 \nPage 3 \n  \n  increasing access to books and records of entities in the post-acquisition structure up to \nand including Alloy Parent.  \n \nYou also asked about the estimated date conditions will be met for Minnesota Power’s \nreturn on equity (“ROE”) to be reduced to 9.65 percent following close of the Acquisition \nand for the other settlement benefits to take effect. Commitment 1.14 in the Settlement \nprovides that the ROE adjustment will take effect “the first full month after both of the \nfollowing have occurred: (i) the close of the Acquisition and (ii) when the order of the \nCommission becomes final.” The timing of the Commission order will be established by \nthe Commission; as such, we cannot specifically provide dates.  Beyond that, the \nPetitioners hope to close the Acquisition as soon as practicable, which will allow the \nmany benefits of the settlement to begin accruing to customers and the State of \nMinnesota. \n \nIn addition, you asked some questions regarding the Company’s plans related to land \nsales and funding of the CARE program. Commitment 1.46 does not alter land sale \nproposals in Docket No. E015/PA-20-675, but rather seeks to accelerate the return of \nthese funds to customers and addresses the manner in which the funds are returned to \ncustomers (which was not previously determined).  LPI and other stakeholders will have \nthe opportunity to respond to the Company’s proposal under Commitment 1.46.  \nCommitments related to energy affordability provide binding commitments that benefit \nconsumers, including Commitment 1.47, which ensures the budget for CARE will not be \nreduced, regardless of circumstances in the future, and further demonstrates the \nalignment between the Company and the Partners to serve customers in the region.  \n \nLastly, the Partners’ willingness to finance a Clean Technology Fund, agree to a rate \ncase stay-out, finance customer arrearages, reduce the ROE, and remove other cost \nitems from rates means neither LPI customers nor any other customers will be asked to \npay for those items in the future, providing significant cost savings.  The Company has \nalso agreed to service quality commitments with penalties that the Company – not \ncustomers – would pay if not met. These binding, enforceable commitments are a \nmaterial benefit of the settlement.   \n \nThese commitments will benefit all customer classes, including industrial classes, but \ncannot take effect unless the acquisition is approved and until the settlement takes \neffect. Once the acquisition is approved, it will be consummated and, as set forth in \nCommitment 1.26 of the settlement, the definitive governance documentation regarding \nALLETE will be consistent with the settlement as approved by the Commission.  And, \nultimately, the Commission will determine what the Company’s rates and costs to \ncustomers will (or will not) be. \n \nLPI Initial Comment on Proposed Settlement \nAppendix C \nPage 3\nMr. Moratzka \nJuly 24, 2025 \nPage 4 \n  \n  The Petitioners would be happy to meet with you and discuss the settlement.

    "content": "Setting the Record  Straight:  The Case  for ALLETE's  Access  to Capital \nand Clean Energy Leadership  \nPolicy without  capital is  a plan without  power.  \n \nIntroduction  \nALLETE has long been a trusted provider of reliable energy and a committed partner in advancing \nclean energy initiatives. As the energy industry undergoes rapid transformation, driven by the \nimperative  to adopt  sustainable  practices, the  role of access to capital  becomes critical. This  position \npaper outlines why access  to new  capital is essential  for ALLETE's continued  progress toward  clean \nenergy, its connection to affordable rates and reliable service, and the  necessity of returns for capital \nproviders.  \nALJ  Concerns \nThe concerns raised by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) do not reflect the economic or \noperational  realities  of today’s  energy sector;  particularly  for a company  like ALLETE that is striving \nto balance a clean energy transition with reliable service and ratepayer affordability. Suggesting that the acquisition by Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) does not deliver clear benefits to the public overlooks a critical truth: without new capital and \nstrategic partners, ALLETE risks falling behind in the infrastructure race requ ired to meet both state \nmandates and regional expectations for energy resilience and decarbonization.  \nCriticism of the transaction’s impact on ratepayers also appears to misunderstand the direct \nconnection between capital access and rate stability. Delaying or denying access to long -term, patient \ncapital increases the likelihood that ALLETE will be forced to rely on shorter -term, higher -cost \nfinancing or defer  needed  investment  altogether. Both  scenarios ultimately  push  costs  onto \ncustomers, either through higher maintenance expenses from aging infrastructure or regulatory penalties for failing to meet clea n energy targets. The CPP and GIP investment, by contrast, enables \na forward - looking capital plan that supports efficiency, scale, and long- term rate moderation.  \nMoreover, as part of this agreement, Minnesota Power is locking in immediate financial relief for \ncustomers by freezing base electric rates for the next year —delivering rate certainty at a time when \nfamilies  and businesses  need  it most.  The company  is also lowering  its authorized  Return  on Equity \nfrom 9.78% to 9.65% post -close, a decision that directly reduces the cost burden on customers until \nthe next formal rate proceeding.  \n \nThese are not symbolic gestures. These are real, measurable outcomes that benefit customers right \nnow. This  approach  reflects  strong,  forward -looking  leadership:  securing the capital  needed  for long-  \nterm investment while ensuring affordability and predictability today. It is a clear example of how \nresponsible utility regulation and strategic private investment can work hand- in-hand to serve the \npublic interest.  \nFurther, the ALJ raises the issue of public benefit , yet this transaction squarely serves the public \ninterest. A better -capitalized ALLETE can invest more confidently and expeditiously in projects that \nreduce emissions, improve grid stability, and attract federal and state infrastructure funding. These \nare not theoretical gains. They are practical outcomes that will shape the energy landscape of \nnorthern Minnesota for decades. Moreover, CPP and GIP’s long- term orientation and infrastructure \nexpertise provid e oversight and accountability that is arguably more aligned with public interest than \nthe pressures of quarterly reporting and shareholder short -termism in the public markets.  \nFinally, it is worth underscoring that returns to investors like CPP and GIP are not antithetical to \ncommunity  benefit. They  are the mechanism  by which capital  flows into  regions  like ours  in the first \nplace. The alternative is not a better offer; it is no offer. Blocking transactions on philosophical grounds, without a clear economic alternative, risks eroding confidence in Minnesota as a place where essential infrastructure investments can succeed. That is not just a missed opportunity for ALLETE. This is  a step backward for the entire region.  \nLet’s  review  the full picture.  \nWhy  New  Access to Capital  is Critical for ALLETE's  Clean  Energy  Transition  \nTransitioning to clean  energy is  a capital -intensive  endeavor. The development  of renewable  energy \ninfrastructure, such as wind farms, solar arrays, and energy storage systems, requires significant \nupfront investments. Additionally, aging grid infrastructure must be modernized to support these \nclean energy sources and ensure reliability.  \nCanada  Pension Plan  (CPP)  Investment  Board  \nThe CPP Investment Board, established in 1997 by an Act of Parliament, manages Canada Pension \nPlan investments  with a focus  on maximizing  long- term returns without undue  risk of loss. The CPP \nis accountable to Parliament and to federal and provincial ministers, however, it operates \nindependently guided by an independent Board of Directors. The investment -only mandate helps \nensure the Fund’s long- term sustainability and financial security for Canadians.  \nGlobal  Infrastructure Partners  (GIP) \nGIP aims to deliver attractive returns by investing in infrastructure assets that empower economies and societies across  the globe.  Its strategy is  driven  by an extensive  global  network of  relationships, \na disciplined investment approach, and comprehensive operational expertise that focuses on \nimproving businesses for the long- term.  \nALLETE's ability to access new  capital  through its partnership with  the Canada Pension Plan \nInvestment  Board  (CPP) and  Global  Infrastructure  Partners (GIP) is vital for several  reasons:  \n• Scaling Renewable Energy Projects: To meet both regulatory mandates and community expectations  for cleaner  energy, ALLETE needs  the financial  capacity  to accelerate  \nlarge - scale renewable projects.  \n• Innovation in Technology:  Investment  in cutting -edge  technologies, such as energy  \nstorage and smart grids, is essential to maintain reliability as renewable energy sources are \nintegrated.  \n• Risk Management: New capital provides the financial buffer needed to manage risks \nassociated  with clean  energy development, such as project  delays,  fluctuating energy prices, \nand technological challenges.  \nThe Connection Between  Access  to Capital,  Affordable  Rates,  and Reliable  Service  \nEnergy providers like  ALLETE must balance  three  priorities: transitioning  to cleaner energy \nsources, maintaining reliable service, and keeping rates affordable for customers. Access to \ncapital is the critical link between these priorities:  \n• Economies  of Scale  Reduce  Costs:  With  access to substantial  capital,  ALLETE can build \nlarger, more efficient renewable projects, driving down the per -unit cost of energy \nproduction. This ultimately helps keep customer rates affordable.  \n• Preventing Costly Delays:  Without sufficient  capital,  projects  are delayed  or scaled  back, \nwhich can lead to higher costs over time as compliance with clean energy mandates \nbecomes more urgent.  \n• Maintaining  Reliability: Transitioning to renewable energy sources can present  \nchallenges to grid reliability, particularly during peak demand. Investment in grid  \nmodernization, energy storage, and backup systems  ensures that  reliability is  not \ncompromised as the energy mix evolves.  \nIn short, access to capital allows ALLETE to make the necessary investments now, avoiding higher costs and  reliability challenges in the future, while  protecting ratepayers from  the financial burdens  of \ninaction.  \nWhy  Providers  of Capital  Need  a Return  \nThe partnership with CPP and GIP brings more than just capital —it brings strategic expertise and \nlong- term alignment with ALLETE's  clean  energy goals.  However,  it is important  to recognize  that \nthese entities, as providers of capital, require a return on their investment. Here’s why:  \n• Capital Has a Cost:  Investors  like CPP and GIP  allocate resources to  projects  that generate \na return. Without the incentive of returns, these entities would direct their capital elsewhere, leaving ALLETE without the financial means to achieve its goals.  \n• Risk-Reward Balance: Transitioning to clean energy  carries risks, including market \nvolatility,  regulatory changes,  and technological  uncertainties.  The returns  investors \nreceive are compensation for assuming these risks.  \n• Alignment with ALLETE's Success: CPP and GIP are not short -term investors. Their \ncommitment to ALLETE is built on a shared vision of long- term growth and community \nimpact.  Their  returns are tied to ALLETE's success  in delivering reliable,  affordable,  and \nclean energy.  \nThe returns generated by CPP and GIP are not a detriment to ALLETE's customers —they are a \nnecessary component of ensuring ALLETE can secure the funding required to build a cleaner, more reliable energy future.  \nConclusion \nAccess to new capital is a pivotal cornerstone of ALLETE's ability to transition to clean energy \nwhile maintaining affordable rates and reliable service. Partnerships with experienced investors like \nCPP and  GIP provide  the financial  resources, strategic expertise,  and long- term alignment needed \nto meet these challenges. Furthermore, the return on investment required by capital providers is a \nreasonable and essential part of this equation, ensuring that ALLETE can continue to attract the \nfunding necessary to serve its customers and communities.  \nThis partnership represents an opportunity to advance ALLETE's leadership in clean energy, \nbenefiting  both  the environment and the  economic  well-being of  the communities  it serves.  Ensuring \naccess to capital today secures a sustainable and prosperous energy future for tomorrow.  \nPolicy without  capital  is a plan without  power.  \n \nAuthor  \nMatt Baumgartner, MBA,  CFA Candidate , President  & CEO , Duluth  Area  Chamber  of Commerce  \nCo-signe d \nApril Jesperson , President  & CEO , Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce  \nKimberly Parmeter, IOM , MBA, President & CEO , Hermantown Area Chamber of Commerce  \nPurva Watten, President & CEO , Little Falls Chamber of Commerce  \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

    "content": "1  Dear Commission,  The Private Equity Stakeholder Project is a nonprofit watchdog organization with a mission to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry and help empower impacted communities and investors. Our organization provided expert testimony in this case on behalf of the intervenor CURE, opposing the private equity acquisition of ALLETE and its subsidiary Minnesota Power. Our organization has reviewed the proposed settlement between the Department of Commerce and ALLETE and found that the proposal does not adequately resolve the concerns we raised about the private equity buyout of Minnesota Power by GIP and BlackRock. It also leaves room for financial engineering tactics outlined in the recently released ALJ Findings of Facts - “If the Partners employ financial engineering strategies to increase the returns they earn from their investments in Alloy, the likely result is extra debt that causes ALLETE’s cost of capital to rise, which would result in rates that are higher than they otherwise would have been absent the proposed acquisition.”1 Therefore, we do not find the settlement consistent with the public interest within the meaning of Minn. Stat. § 216B.50.  The capital commitments outlined in the settlement do not address concerns outlined in our testimony about the rate of return GlP anticipates receiving for this acquisition. In pitch materials to investors, GIP advertised that the fund being used to acquire Minnesota Power will target a 15-20% annual return (IRR) before fees.2 This is around double the return (8.36%) that publicly-traded US utilities have generated over the past decade.3  In addition, GIP seeks to collect a 5-7% annual cash yield (i.e., dividend) from portfolio companies it acquires. The settlement provides a modest return on equity (ROE) reduction of 9.78 to 9.65 percent until Minnesota Power’s next rate case.4 The settlement then proposes a roughly one-year rate freeze, until November 1, 2026, with no rate-protections for customers beyond that.5 As outlined in our testimony, there is a risk of bill hikes after private equity acquires a utility, even if there is a “freeze” for one year. In the UPPCO example, the company applied for a rate increase6 the year following an acquisition by a private equity firm, leading to unaffordable  1  State of Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings, “Findings Of Fact, Conclusions Of Law, And Recommendations”, Accessed July 29, 2025, https://www.edockets.state.mn.us/documents/%7B70F30F98-0000-CF5C-BB62-491162C889B0%7D/download?contentSequence=0&rowIndex=24  2 Erick Russell to Members of the Investment Advisory Council, February 3, 2023, p.194  3  Based on a 10-year annualized total return of 8.36%, Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index, accessed Jan 24, 2025. https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-us-utilities-index/?currency=USD&returntype=T-#overview  4  Settlement Stipulation Between The Minnesota Department Of Commerce, Allete, Inc.

As the ALJ Findings Of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations noted, “the Commission lacks authority to force the Partners to take actions such as providing capital to Minnesota Power, retaining employees, making community investments, or withholding dividends. It is also unlikely that the Commission has the vast resources that would be required to monitor compliance with all of the commitments – meaning a violation would likely only become clear after a violation and substantial harm had already occurred.”10   The stipulations outlined in this settlement regarding rates of return, debt, and rate increases are weak. There is still a threat that Minnesota Power’s captive customer base would bear the financial burden of fulfilling private equity’s promises to its investors regarding above-market returns.   Given these outstanding concerns about the cost of capital for ALLETE and risks to ratepayers, we urge the PUC to find this deal not in the public interest and vote not to approve the deal.

The HeatShare initiative is a needs -based heat assistance program offered at most Salvation Army operation centers in Minnesota. It is \navailable to low -income seniors,  those living with a disability that prevents them from maintaining a steady \nincome, and anyone experiencing an unexpected financial emergency. Furthermore, HeatShare is a safety net for \nMinnesotans who have been declined by other governmental assistance programs and is typically the last resort \nfor help with past due heat bills. As many as 4,000 households are helped annually through the HeatShare \nassistance program.  \nCurrently, financial support for the program comes from optional HeatShare donations by ratepayers, as well as \nlocal utility companies, other organizations, and individual donors. However, with a program budget of just $1.2 \nmillion, the need is substantial ly greater than what the current funding can cover.  \nSalvation Army Northern Division also helps people access resources through the Low -Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program (LIHEAP). However, that program’s funding is uncertain for Federal Fiscal Year 2026.  \nWe believe additional resources, like the contribution described in the proposed settlement agreement, would \nhelp low -income people in our communities pay for essential utility services and give some much -needed relief as \nthey try to balance limited budget s to meet their everyday needs. We submit these comments in support of the \nproposed financial contribution by the partners and would gladly assist with outreach to raise awareness about \nthis additional resource.         \n \nThank you,  \n \nAna Gonzalez, LSW  \nDivisional HeatShare  \nThe Salvation Army Northern Division  \nThis message may be from an external email source.\nDo not select links or open attachments unless verified.

The proceeding contains an extensive record covering numerous issues related \nto the details  and potential outcomes of the Acquisition, with significant attention being paid to \nthe interest of Minnesota Power ratepayers. CEE/CEEM  have reviewed much of the record and  \nrecognize th e concerns raised from parties  regarding potential ratepayer and other impacts \n \n1 CEE is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization whose mission is to discover and deploy the most effective energy \nsolutions that strengthen the economy and improve the environment , envisioning a health y, carbon -neutral \neconomy that works for all people. See mncee.org/mission -values .   \n2 CEEM is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide educational leadership, collaboration, and \npolicy analysis that accelerates clean energy market growth and smart energy policies , providing the business voice \nfor energy efficiency and clean energy in Minnesota. See cleanenergyeconomymn.org/about .  \n3 References to Minnesota Power in these comments relate to the utility as a regulated operating division of \nALLETE.  \n \n \n2 \n resulting from the Acqui sition . However, CEE/CEEM argue  the Acquisition , with the stipulations \ncontained  in the Settlement , is consistent with the public interest for four  reasons . \nFirst, t he efforts necessary  to meet the Carbon  Free Standard (CFS) provisions  set forth in Minn. \nStat. § 216B. 1691  will require  significant  and unprecedented  investment in the electric system  \nover the next 15 years. As stated by Minnesota Power and co-signers4 in Joint Reply Briefs filed \nMay 29, 2025,  “the Acquisition is essential to Minnesota Power’s plans to comply with the \nCarbon Free Standard”5 through investments “far beyond  [Minnesota Power’s] historic levels ”6 \nthat “include major transmission, generation, and distribution projects to meet increasing \ncustomer needs and replace retiring thermal generation, while also maintaining reliability of \nthe grid.”7 Although the exact investment levels  needed may be uncertain or disputed by \nparties , the scope of investment needed is clear , and the Acquisition makes that level of capital \navailable to Minnesota Power today . \nIn additio n, other Minnesota policies provide pathways for  electric and gas utilities to electrify  \nend uses typically served by natural gas  and other fuels , such as space heating .8 As the electric \nsystem decarbonizes under the CFS, electrifying significant portions of the economy is critical to \nmeeting the state’s greenhouse gas emission reduction goals under Minn. Stat. § 216H.02 . This \nunderscores the need to give electric utilities the tools necessary to invest in decarbonizing the \nelectric system while at the same time electrifying customer end use technologies.  \nSecond, if the Acqu isition is approved , Minnesota Power will still be regulated by the \nCommission under the authority provided by Minnesota Statute s and Minnesota Rules. While \ncertain aspects of the company will change, such as governance through the composition of the \nboard of directors and capital flowing from private owners instead of public equity markets, \nnone of those changes will affect the Commission’s authority, process, or obligation  to regulate \nMinnesota Power’s actions regarding infrastructure investments, resource procurements and \nretirements, capital structure, rates, programs , customer service , and reliability  in a manner \nconsistent with the public interest . \nFurthermore, generating or procuring electricity to meet 100 percent of retail customer needs \nfrom carbon -free energy technology by 2040 is the law,9 with explicit  authority given to the \n \n4 Signers included ALLETE d/b/a Minnesota  Power, CPPIB, GIP, LIUNA MN, IOUE Local 49, IBEW Local 31, and \nEnergy CENTS Coalition.  \n5 Joint Reply Brief  of Minnesota Power, Canada Pension Plan Inve stment Board, and Global Infrastruc ture Partners . \nFiled May 29, 2025, in Docket No. E015/PA -24-198.  Page 9.  \n6 Id. Page 9.  \n7 Id. Page 10.  \n8 See Minn. Stat. § 216B .241 ( Energy Conservation and Optimization ) and Minn. Stat. § 216B.2427 ( Natural Gas \nUtility Innovation Plan s). \n9 Minn Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 2(g).  \n \n \n3 \n Commission to enforce the law and impose financial penalties for noncompliance.10 The \nAcquisition does not change Minnesota Power ’s legal requirement to comply with Minn. Stat. § \n216B.1691 as regulated and implement ed by the Commission.  \nThird, the Settlement filed July 11, 2025, provides significant provisions focused on ratepayer \nprotections, workforce and labor stipulations , and commitments to low -income program \ninvestments, community  contributions, customer service and reliability metrics,  and clean \nenergy funds, that were not included in the initial petition .11 These provisions were negotiated \nand established  by the Department and other parties after thorough review and analysis of the \nAcquisition and subsequent discovery and testimony , and provide safeguards against many \nconcerns raised in the record.  \nFinally , the risk of not approving the Acquisition outweighs the remaining risks associated with \napproving the Acquisition. While no deal is perfect, the Acquisition with the Settlement \nprovides the necessary capital needed for Minnesota Power to continue its progress towards \nmeeting the CFS, while protecting ratepayers  and investing in clean energy jobs that di versi fy \nnortheast Minnesota’s economy, under the full regulatory authority of the Commission. If the \nCommission denies the Acquisition, Minnesota Power will have to seek alternative options to \nfund CFS -related investments that will take significant time and resource s to develop and \nassess, and that will undoubtedly carry their own risks to ratepayers.  \nFor the above reasons, CEE/CEEM find the Acquisition with the Settlement to be consistent \nwith the public interest. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions.  \n \nSincerely,  \n/s/ Chris Duffrin  \nPresident  \nCenter for Energy and Environment  \n \n/s/ Will Nissen  \nDirector of Policy  \nCenter for Energy and Environm ent \nwnissen@mncee.org   /s/ Greg g Mast  \nExecutive Director  \nClean Energy Economy Minnesota  \n \n/s/ George Damian  \nDirector of Government Affairs  \nClean Energy Economy Minnesota  \ngdamian@cleanenergyeconomymn.org\n \n \n10 Minn Stat. § 216B.1691, subd. 7.  \n11 Settlement Stipulation between the Minn esota Department of Commerce, A LLET E, Inc. d/b/a Minne sota Power, \nCanada Pension Plan Inve stment Board, and Global Infrastructure Partners .
