We expect capital spending for North America’s \nelectric, gas, and water utilities will grow by a compound annual growth rate  (CAGR) of about 10%. \nAccordingly, we expect 2025 capital spending to reflect about $240 billion  (see chart  9).

Over the past decade t he industry has invest ed billions on \nreducing its reliance on coal- fired generation  by about 50%  (see chart  10), and today, coal \nrepresents only about 15% of total electric generation. M ost of the coal was  replaced with natural \ngas, which has about half the carbon emissions. W e expect  the industry will replace most of its \nremaining coal -fired generation  by about 2030 with renewables and batteries , further reducing \nits carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The industry  has reduced its GHG emissions by \nnearly 30% over the past decade ( see chart 11 ), and we expect it will reduce them by another 30% \nby 2035.   \nChart 10 \nU.S. generation transformation  \n \nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The higher spending for data centers is \nmore likely to begin in  2026 . Accordingly , 2026 capex  could potentially increase by about another \n15%  above our current base case ( see chart  12). \nChart 12 \nData center growth will increase U.S. electric utility annual capital spending by about 15%  \n \nT&D —Transmission and distribution.

It raised only about $8 billion in 2024 , and we \nestimate that the full year will reflect only  about $10 billion. This is well below  the industry’s \naverage run rate of about $20 billion annually between 2018 -2020  (see chart  15). We expect 2025 \ncommon equity issu ance will again be relatively weak  and more reflective of 2024 levels. W ithout \nsignificantly more common equity issuance, we expect the industry's finan cial measures will \ncontinue to weaken, albeit gradually, supporting our negative outlook. \nChart 15 \nNorth America regulated utilities ’ common equity issuance \n \nYTD —Year- to-date as of Dec. 15, 2024.

We assess all North America's regulatory \njurisdictions as credit supportive or better, reflecting the industry's generally stable and \npredictable cash flows ( see chart  16). Over the past decade m uch of the industry has \nimplemented regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling, interim rates, capital trackers, formula \nrate plans, forward test years, muti -year rate case filings, and regulatory riders  to significantly \nimprove cash flow stability while minimizing regulatory lag ( that is,  the timing difference between \nwhen a utility incurs costs and when it's recovered from ratepayers) .  \nChart 16 \nRegulatory assessment by state  \nAs of November 2024  \n \nSource: S&P Global Ratings.  \nIn general, we expect utilities will  operate in a regulatory jurisdiction that is supportive of their \ncredit quality by allowing for the full recovery of all their operating and capital costs in a timely \nmanner. We also expect the regulatory jurisdiction will  provide a consistent and predictable \nregulatory framework that results in cash flow stability. Our view of the industry's regulatory \nconstructs supports the industry's mostly investment -grade ratings despite the industry \ncontinuing to operate with mate rial cash flow deficits. \nRecently , we revised downward our assessment of Connecticut’s regulatory construct  to credit  \nsupportive from more credit supportive. We now expect the state's regulated utilities will be \nincreasingly subject to below -average authorized ROEs, regulatory lag, and an inconsistent ability \nto earn their lower authorized ROEs. These developments will increase the utilities' cash flow \nvolatility, decrease the stability of their financial performances, and weaken their ability to \nconsistently manage regulatory risk. Other regulatory jurisdictions that we continue to carefully \nmonitor include Arizona, Colo rado, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico , \nTexas , and West Virginia . \n\nIndustry Credit Outlook 2025 : North America Regulated Utilities  \nspglobal.com/ratings   January 14, 2025  9 \n Regulatory rate case order  increases  have substantially risen  over the past four years, \nreflecting the industry’s r obust capital spending. R ate case increases for 2021 -2024  have \nincreased by more than 2.5x compared to 2017 -2020 (see chart 17 ), and there are more than 100 \nU.S. rate cases pending,  for which utilities are requesting over  $16 billion more in revenue . This is \nin line with our base case that this year’s rate case orders will again be robust and most likely in \nthe top three years for rate case order increases. \nChart 17 \nU.S. rate case orders  \n \nSource: S&P Global Commodity Insights . \nUtilities' exposure to physical risks are  increasing . According to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), on an inflation- adjusted basis, 2021 and 2022 represent two \nof the most destructive years for extreme weather events since 1980 ( see chart 18). We assume \nthese trends will persist, magnifying physical risks for the utility industry. \nChart 18 \nU.S. billion -dollar weather disaster year -to-date event cost (CPI -adjusted)  \n \nSource: National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration . 02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,000\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024(Mi. $)\n050100150200250300350400450\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec(Bil. $)Average (1980-2023)\n2005\n2012\n2017\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nIndustry Credit Outlook 2025 : North America Regulated Utilities  \nspglobal.com/ratings   January 14, 2025  10 \n Drier, hotter weather has increased  the acreage designated as high -fire-risk across the U.S . This  \nis already taking a toll on credit ratings. For example, in  2024 we downgraded parent Xcel Energy  \nInc. and subsidiary Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS) because of the scale and severity of \nthe wildfires in the Texas panhandle, which  highlight s their increasing wildfire exposure. Overall, \nbecause of climate change, we expect the industry’s wildfire risk will increase. \nSecuritization  increased , which we assess as supportive of credit quality  (see chart 19) . \nSecuritization allows for the issuance of debt secured by a non -bypassable charge to the \ncustomer's bill, allowing the utility to fully recover storm -related costs at a lower interest rate for \ncustomers. Because the debt is secured by the high likelihood of customers paying their bills, the \nassociated interest costs are typically lower. We often deconsolidate such debt, resulting in \nstronger credit measures.  \nChart 19 \nS&P Global Ratings -rated utility -related securitization issuance (2018- 2024)  \n  \nSource: S&P Global Ratings.  \nWe expect securitization will remain an effective tool that the industry will continue to use. Our \nbase case includes increasing severe natural disasters and weather events as well as continued \nefforts to decarbonize the energy sector, which sometimes requires securitization to fully \nrecover under -depreciated retiring fossil- fuel generating plants. \nCredit metrics and financial policy  \nWe expect rising capital spending and increasing cash flow deficits that are not sufficiently funded in a credit -supportive manner  will continue to pressure the industry's financial \nperformance. Its average funds from operations  (FFO)  to debt was about 15% in 2021 and has \ngradually fallen to about 1 3.5%, primarily reflecting rising leverage (see chart 20) . Given our \nexpectations for continued increasing capital spending over the next decade, we expect financial performance and credit quality will continue t o be pressured. \n \n \n \n \n \n  02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,00016,00018,000\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024(Mil. $)\nIndustry Credit Outlook 2025 : North America Regulated Utilities  \nspglobal.com/ratings   January 14, 2025  11 \n Chart 20 \nNorth American regulated utilities’ average FFO  to debt\n \na—Actual . Source: S&P Global Ratings . \nKey risks or opportunities around the baseline  \nWildfire risk has expanded.  Recent events  in the Northeast  U.S. lead us to  believe wildfire risk \nhas spread and now potentially affects nearly every utility across North America. ( About 15 years \nago, it was primarily limited to  just Southern California .)  \nWildfire risk is highly negative for credit quality.  The scale of potential liabilities, unpredictable \nnature of exposures, and frequency of events have  materially increased wildfire risk for many \nutility stakeholders. From a credit standpoint, litigation risk is more problematic than risk of \ndamage to infrastructure because it is difficult to predict or quantify and is so far without \nsufficient mitigation or containment. Also, w ildfire -related litigation  payments are typically not \nrecoverable in rates or through other regulatory mechanisms, making them more problematic \nthan physical risk.  \nAdditional  wildfire risks to credit quality include:  \n• Insurance is becoming more expensive and less available.  \n• It only requires a relatively small percentage of damaged or destroyed structures from a \nwildfire to have a material negative effect on a utility’s c redit quality.  0246810121416\n2021a 2022a 2023a(%)\n1. Wildfire mitigation efforts . \nWildfire risk mitigation, while clearly a credit positive, may not fully address the threats \nassociated with extreme weather events. \n2. Data centers and sales growth.  \nData center electricity demand will likely boost revenues at North America n investor -owned \nregulated utilities and provide modest support for the industry's credit quality.  \n3. Managing the customer bill . \nThe average electric customer bill is about 2% of U.S. median household income, which \nrepresents good value for customers relative to other typical household bills. Preserving this \nvalue  is critical for the industry to maintain credit quality.  \nIndustry Credit Outlook 2025 : North America Regulated Utilities  \nspglobal.com/ratings   January 14, 2025  12 \n • The utility industry’s relatively high leveraged balance sheets and modest authorized ROEs are \nnot a  backstop for wildfire risk.  \n• Utilities that are impacted by  a catastrophic wildfire and material third- party claims typically \ncannot  implement other strategic initiatives.  \nMitigation strategies.  We expect the industry will develop plans that reduce damages, minimize \nlitigation risk, and expand capabilities for cost recovery  from wildfires. We believe the industry  \nwill be able to implement much of these strategies over the nearer term because most  are not \npredicated on the develop ment of n ew technologies  or product s. That said, because the industry \noperates in many different service territories and topographies, we  expect each  utility ’s \nmitigation plan will be customized  to its unique exposure.  Chart 21 represents a n array  of wildfire \nmitigation strategies that either have or are being implemented by many utilities across North \nAmerica.  \nChart 21 \nNorth American regulated utilities’ wildfire mitigation efforts  \nSource: S&P Global Ratings.  \nData centers will likely deliver a return to electricity sales g rowth.  We expect electricity sales \nwill increase at a CAGR of about 1.1%. This  reflects our view that systematic and careful planning \nacross the investor -owned utility sector will likely limit its realistic capability to grow at a \nsubstantially faster pace. In general, t he expansion of utility infrastructure assets is a long -term \nplanning process that requires permitting, siting, and regulatory approvals.  \nHowever, even a 1% CAGR for electricity sales will likely prove transformative for the utility industry , which  has experienced flat sales growth over the past two decades. In particular , the \ngrowing number of data centers will allow the industry to spread its fixed costs over a wider base. We anticipate this will provide some cushion for the industry to effectively manage regulatory risk and maintain credit quality without necessarily requiring that every rate case order is highly supportive of credit quality.  \nWe also expect electric utilit ies' sales CAGR  will be maintained over the longer term  (see chart  \n22), which will support the industry's long- term credit quality . We expect growth in data center \nnumbers will support most of the industry's growth t hrough  2030 . In the following decade, \n\nIndustry Credit Outlook 2025 : North America Regulated Utilities  \nspglobal.com/ratings   January 14, 2025  13 \n increased onshoring of manufacturing and wider spread adoption of electric vehicles will also \nsupport growth .  \nChart 22 \nGrowth will be transformative for utilities used to stagnation \nElectricity demand: U.S. regulated electric utilities  \n \nData as of June 2024. CAGR —Compound annual growth rate. Sources: U.S. Energy Information Administration (historical and \n1.1% CAGR) and S&P Global Commodity Insights (1.7% CAGR).  \nData center credit risks.  The industry must structure rates and contracts to ensure that the new \ndata center customers are paying their share of electricity costs. Meeting the demands of \nrelatively few , but very large , data center customers will require significant capital spending and \ninfrastructure investments. If utilities assign a significant portion of data center -related \ninfrastructure costs to existing residential customers, customer bills would increase. This , in \nturn, pressures regulators to limit rate case increases, which  can negatively affect the industry's \nability to effectively manage regulatory risk.  \nTherefore, w e expect the increased capital spending needed to accommodate data center  \ngrowth will be primarily recovered from data center customers over decades. Such a plan comes \nwith risks. For example, a technological breakthrough that reduces or eliminates the need for \ndata centers could shift the recovery of these long- term infrastructure inv estments onto \nresidential customers.  \nCapacity prices.  Pennsylvania -New Jersey -Maryland ( PJM ) Interconnection  capacity prices \nmaterially increased during its latest capacity auction  (see chart  23). These higher prices are \ndirectly passed onto customers, significantly increasing the electric utility bill. If these higher \nprices persist, it will likely result in higher customer complaints, pressuring regulators to limit \nincreases to other areas of the customer  bill that could potentially pressur e a utility’s ability to \neffectively man age regulatory risk. \n \n \n   01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,000Net electricity generation (Bil. kilowatt -hours) CAGR at 0.3%\nCAGR at 1.1%\nCAGR at 1.7%\nIndustry Credit Outlook 2025 : North America Regulated Utilities  \nspglobal.com/ratings   January 14, 2025  14 \n Chart 23 \nPJM capacity auction results \n \nSource: PJM website.  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I n 2024 the EPA released final rules aimed at \nreducing pollution from fossil fuel- fired power plants , which  included carbon pollution standards \nand effluent limitation guidelines and standards for coal- fired power plants. These rules would \nhave increased costs for utilities, specifically regarding the requirement to install carbon capture \nand sequestration  or storage technology on coal- fired power plants intending to operate beyond \n2039.  \nHowever, we note that the incoming U.S. presidential administration and Republican majority in congress could modify or eliminate these rules. We will monitor executive, legislative, or legal \nactions that could impact the industry’s credit quality.  \nFull electrification.  We expect the longer -term credit quality for some natural gas local \ndistribution companies (LDC) will become increasingly challenging, especially for utilities that \noperate in warmer climates or whose cities or states have banned new gas connections, severely \nlimiting the growth of natural gas LDCs (see chart 2 4). We expect this trend will also gradually  \npersist through the passage of local city and town building codes that limit carbon and other \nemissions.  \nOffsetting some of this risk is that a majority of states have imposed a ban on the ban  of new gas \nconnections. Furthermore, gas LDCs are attempting to reduce their environmental risks by \ndecreasing their carbon footprint through investing in renewable natural gas, blending hydrogen, \nand initiating various hydrogen infrastructure projects.  \n \n    \n \n  050100150200250300\n2018/ 2019 2019/ 2020 2020/ 2021 2021/2022 2022/ 2023 2023/2024 2024/2025 2025/2026($/megawatt -day)Eastern MAAC\nMAAC\nPS North\nRTO\nComED\nSWMAAC\nAverage\nIndustry Credit Outlook 2025 : North America Regulated Utilities  \nspglobal.com/ratings   January 14, 2025  15 \n Chart 24 \nGas bans and electrification mandates  \n \nData as of April 26, 2024. *Municipalities shown on map are a subset of municipalities in the U.S. that have gas ban policies  or \nelectric reach codes in place. §Colorado and Burlington mandates target emissions requirements set out in respective laws \nor re gulations.

We briefly describe the asset class, its sub-categories \nand strategies, its risk and return profile, and implementation considerations. \nWe focus on private markets infrastructure in this paper.\nWhat is infrastructure?\nAs an investment asset class, infrastructure includes long-lived tangible assets that \nderive value from their intrinsic physical characteristics. Infrastructure is the foundation \nfor the production and delivery of goods and services critical to the global economy.\nInfrastructure assets often have some combination of the following characteristics: \nlong useful lives, high barriers to entry, monopolistic market positioning, and generally \nstable usage. Infrastructure investments also usually enjoy inelastic demand, \nrelatively stable cash flows, and low long-term exposure to commodity prices. These \nattributes are usually attached to assets that have an “essentiality” component, such \nas those associated with transportation, energy and other critical utilities, government \noperations, and mass communication networks. \nSectors\nThe private infrastructure asset class can be categorized both by the sectors it \ntargets as well as by its risk-return profiles. Figure 1 below depicts the various primary \nsectors that infrastructure invests in, as well as the key sub-sectors within each. \nfigure 1\nBreakdown of \nInfrastructure Sectors \nand Sub-Sectors\nSource: Meketa Investment Group, \n2023.Transportation Energy & Power Social Digital/Comms Utilities Sustainability\nSystems that \nmove people and \ngoods through \nthe country and \noverseas\nAIRPORTS\nSEAPORTS\nROADS\nRAILS\nTERMINALS\nMASS TRANSITFocused on power \ngeneration \nPOWER GENE RATION\n DISTRIBUTION\nPROCESSING\nTRANSPORTATION\nSTORAGEConstruction and \nmaintenance \nof public or \ncommunity \nfacilities\nCOURTHOUSES\nSCHOOLS\nMUNICIPAL \nBUILDINGSSystems and \ntechnology \nthat support \nexchanging \ninformation\nTOWERS\nFIBER\nSPECTRUM\nDATA CENTERS\nSATELLITESWater, waste \nmanagement, \nelectric and \nheating systems \nto residential \nconsumers, \nindustries, and \nmunicipals\nCENTRALIZED \nINFRASTRUCTURE\nSTORAGE\nTRANSPORT \nDISTRIBUTION \nTREATMENTDevelopment and \nexploitation of \nrenewables, as \nwell as explicitly \nimpact-oriented \nand ESG-focused \nstrategies\nSOLAR, WIND, & \nHYDRO\nGEOTHERMAL\nWASTE-TO-ENERGY\nBIOMASS\nPOWER DISTRIBUTION\nBATTERY STORAGE\nEFFICIENT UTILITIES\nLED LIGHTING\nMEKETA.COM   |  BOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP PAGE 2 OF 14figure 2\nGlobal Infrastructure \nDeals by Sector (by \naggregate deal value)\nSource: Preqin, as of November \n2023. Social includes the Defense, \nEducation Facilities, Government \nBuildings, and Healthcare/Medical \nFacilities sub-sectors. Transport \nincludes the Transportation and \nLogistics subsectors. Utilities \nincludes the Utilities and Waste \nManagement subsectors.Sustainability has more recently been considered its own sector by some investors and \nhas shown an increase in investor demand. While the “renewables” sector has been \naround since the infrastructure asset class became institutional, sustainability tends to \nbe broader, encompassing renewable energy as well as other sustainable sub-sectors.\nInfrastructure managers can be sector specialists targeting one sector or can aim to \ndiversify across multiple sectors (typically two to four). Figure 2 below shows a sector \nbreakdown by deal value. The energy and transportation sectors have comprised \nmore than half of total deal value since 2006. This is followed by utilities, though \ncommunications has increased substantially in recent years.11  Source: Preqin, as of November \n2023.\nInvestable universe\nThe investable private infrastructure universe first became a noteworthy part of the \nprivate market landscape around 2006, and it has grown more robust ever since. \nInfrastructure funds have raised approximately $1.3 trillion from 2000 through 2022 \n(see Figure 3). More recently, aggregate capital raised per year has grown to a record \n$176 billion in 2022.2 Since 2009, infrastructure fundraising has grown every year except \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The number of funds in the infrastructure \nmarket in any given year has also grown considerably, reaching almost 200 in 2021.2  Source: Preqin, as of September \n2023.\nfigure 3\nGlobal Private \nInfrastructure Aggregate \nCapital Raised and \nNumber of Funds\nSource: Preqin, as of September \n2023.\nMEKETA.COM   |  BOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP PAGE 3 OF 14Even with its high growth over the past decade, infrastructure has averaged roughly \n7% of the total annual assets under management (“AUM”) across all private asset \nclasses since 2006 (see Figure 4). This average has not changed significantly over \nthe last decade, holding fairly steady around 8.6%.3\nfigure 4\nGlobal Assets Under \nManagement by Private \nMarkets Asset Class\nSource: Preqin, as of November \n2023. Natural Resources includes \nNatural Resources and Timberland \nfund types only to avoid double \ncounting. To avoid double \ncounting of available capital and \nunrealized value, fund of funds and \nsecondaries are excluded.\nInfrastructure strategies and geography\nIn the section above, we detailed private infrastructure’s numerous sectors and \nthe sub-sectors within each. In this section, we describe the primary strategies \ninfrastructure targets, as categorized by their risk-return profiles. These various \ninfrastructure strategies often reflect different economic exposures and potential \nopportunities. We also provide a geographical breakdown of the asset class.\nStrategies\nInfrastructure strategies, differentiated by their risk and return profiles, are often \nthe first dimension established for diversification within an infrastructure program. \nBoth equity and debt strategies are available in infrastructure. Equity strategies \nmay be broadly characterized as core, core plus, value add, and opportunistic, on a \ncontinuum from lower risk and return to higher risk and return. The strategies are \nnot mutually exclusive. Additionally, the risk/return profile of any individual asset \nmay purposefully change over an owner’s hold period, as managers may enter an \ninvestment at a relatively higher risk-return profile, work to de-risk or otherwise \nimprove the asset, and exit by selling it to investors with a relatively lower risk-\nreturn target.3  Source: Preqin, as of November \n2023. Global private markets \ninclude Infrastructure, Private \nEquity, Real Estate, Natural \nResources, and Private Debt.\nMEKETA.COM   |  BOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP PAGE 4 OF 14Description Typical Investments Return Drivers\nOpportunistic Often involves new construction or \ndevelopment of an asset, which has \nmore risk than buying an existing \noperational asset, but also offers \nthe greatest potential return. These \ninvestments involve an elevated level \nof uncertainty, which may be related \nto revenue stability, future demand \nor usage, or significant exposure \nto commodity prices. This may \nalso include projects in developing \ncountries. Target deals may include \nbrownfield assets that \nare more complicated or \ninvolve more capex than \nvalue add strategies, and/\nor “greenfield” assets that \ndo not currently exist.In developed markets, \nreturns are mostly driven \nby capital appreciation. In \nother geographies, there \ncould be more of a yield \ncomponent, for example, \nif executing an otherwise \ncore or value add strategy.\nValue Add Assets that have many of the same \nqualities as core assets but offer \nthe opportunity for additional \nvalue creation through further \ndevelopment, new or extended \ncontracts, or increased capacity.Typically, “brownfield” \nsituations involving an \nexisting, operating asset \nneeding improvements, \nrepairs, or expansion. May \nalso involve renegotiating \nand extending contracts \nor repurposing existing \nassets.Returns are derived from \na combination of yield and \ncapital appreciation.\nCore Plus Exists between and often overlaps \nwith core and value add. It could \nalso reflect a “build to core” strategy, \nwhere the assets would have a \nhigher risk-return profile during the \ndevelopment, construction, and early \noperations stage, but will ultimately \nqualify as a core asset for a long-term \nhold period. Involves facility expansions \nwithout a complete retrofit \nor rehabilitation.Portions of total return from \nyield and appreciation \nbetween core and value \nadd. Also, may have lower \nyields than core early in \nthe term.\nCore Assets that are essential to the \neconomy and have a high certainty \nof revenue through long-term \ncontracts, significant cash yield, and a \nstrong link to inflation, often through \na pass-through mechanism. “Secondary stage” assets \nthat are fully operational \nand require no investment \nfor development. Returns are primarily \nattributable to current \nyield over a long-term, \neven perpetual hold.figure 5\nInfrastructure Strategy \nDescriptions & Risk-\nReturn Profiles\nSource: Meketa Investment Group, \n2023.\nMany institutional investors tilt their infrastructure portfolios toward lower risk, cash \nyielding strategies. Since 2006, core and core plus have represented 28% and 33% \nof global annual capital raised, respectively. Value add comprised the next largest \nsegment at 20%, followed by debt and opportunistic at 9% each of annual capital \nraised.4\nfigure 6\nAggregate Capital Raised \nGlobally by Infrastructure \nStrategy\nSource: Preqin, as of September \n2023.Return Potential / Riskiness\n4  Source: Preqin, as of September \n2023. Period is 2006 to 2022.\nMEKETA.COM\n  \n|\n  \nBOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP\nPAGE\n 5 \nOF\n 14\nInvestors may include infrastructure debt in either an infrastructure or private debt \nallocation. Infrastructure debt strategies typically offer higher yields than traditional \npublic credit. Infrastructure debt may also be used to diversify a predominantly \ninfrastructure equity portfolio, via lower volatility and better downside protection than \nequity strategies, and with stable returns like those of core strategies. Infrastructure \ndebt often comes with contracted revenues and strong counterparties, and may offer \nupside potential through warrants, options, convertible debt, and other instruments. \nA disadvantage of infrastructure debt is that it does not offer the same ownership \nopportunities and control/governance rights as equity stakes can.\nGeography\nNorth America-focused funds dominate the infrastructure universe, averaging \nhalf of global aggregate capital raised since 2000. Europe has the second largest \ninfrastructure market, at roughly one-third of global aggregate capital raised, followed \nby Asia at 13% of the market since 2000.\n5\n However, in the last five years or so, Asia’s \nmarket share has declined, as measured by aggregate capital raised.\nInfrastructure investments outside of the US can be segmented into two major \ngeographies, developed markets and developing markets. Developed countries tend to \noffer similar categories of risk and reward attributes as those in the US. This is largely \nbecause these regions possess similar political, regulatory, and legal frameworks as the \nUS. Developing markets include both emerging and frontier markets. These investments \nare generally characterized by economies with higher economic growth, but with less \nsecure and less predictable political, legal, economic, and financing frameworks. Comfort \nwith these risks can be more difficult to achieve and tends to require a higher level of \nexperience and insight by managers. In any investment not denominated in US dollars, \ncurrency risk is also a consideration, and managers’ hedging policies vary.\nHistorical performance\nPerformance data for private infrastructure is less robust than that for private equity \nand real estate. This is because fewer funds exist and the asset class did not gain \nsignificant traction in the US until the early-to-mid 2000’s.\n6\n In particular, there is \nno benchmark of core funds that is equivalent to those that are available for core\n5\n \n \nSource: Preqin, as of September \n2023. \n6\n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, 2008 is \nthe start date for infrastructure \nfigures and charts as it is the \nearliest year that has quarterly \nfund count of 8 or higher for each \ninfrastructure strategy. \nfigure 7\nGlobal Aggregate Capital \nRaised in Infrastructure \nby Region\nSource: Preqin, as of September \n2023.\nMEKETA.COM   |  BOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP PAGE 6 OF 14US real estate. Hence, throughout this paper, Cambridge Associates’ Infrastructure \ncomposites are used to represent private infrastructure returns. Due to the small set \nof available data, the value add and opportunistic strategies are grouped together \ninto one “Non-core” category.7\nFigure 8 below shows the annual returns of private infrastructure’s primary core/\ncore plus and non-core strategies. The annualized returns of these two composites \nhave been in line with expectations. Since 2008, the core/core plus composite has \nproduced a lower annualized return of 6.7%, while non-core has produced a higher \nannualized return of 7.8%.8\nfigure 8\nAnnual Returns by \nInfrastructure Strategy\nQuarterly returns sourced \nfrom Cambridge Associates \nvia IHS Markit as of July 2023. \nIndices: Cambridge Core & Core \nPlus Infrastructure Composite, \nCambridge Opportunistic \nInfrastructure Composite, \nCambridge Value Added \nInfrastructure Composite.\nVolatility\nThe historical observed volatility of the core/core plus and non-core categories has \nbeen counter to its targeted risk-return profiles. Despite having the lowest annualized \nreturn and being considered the most stable, core/core plus exhibited the highest \nannualized volatility of the infrastructure strategies at 8.8% since 2008. Over the \nsame period, non-core had an annualized volatility of 6.3%.9 It is also worth noting \nthat the nature of private infrastructure returns, like the rest of private markets, can \nartificially dampen volatility.10\nfigure 9\nAnnualized Rolling 1-Year \nVolatility by Strategy\nQuarterly returns sourced \nfrom Cambridge Associates \nvia IHS Markit as of July 2023. \nIndices: Cambridge Core & Core \nPlus Infrastructure Composite, \nCambridge Opportunistic \nInfrastructure Composite, \nCambridge Value Added \nInfrastructure Composite.7  Both value add and opportunistic \nrepresent 50% of the non-core \ncomposite.

Core and \ncore plus infrastructure typically invest in fully operational assets with minimal or \nno development needs, and these assets are typically valued on a quarterly basis \nbased on operational metrics and industry comps. Value add and opportunistic \ninfrastructure invest in “brownfield” and “greenfield”11 assets that can require some or \nextensive development and may be held at investment cost until a project has been \nde-risked (e.g., it has reached development milestones or become operational) or \nsold. Therefore, while value add and opportunistic assets may entail more risk from \nthe project’s start to its end, core and core plus projects may exhibit higher volatility \nof prices because of the difference in valuation methodology.\nManager alpha\nManager and fund selection in private infrastructure, like all private markets, is essential \nto achieving top quartile returns. Interquartile spreads can be interpreted as how much \npotential value lies in selecting superior funds or managers within each asset class. For \ninfrastructure funds with vintage years 2011 to 2020, the average quartile spread was \n9.0%. Compared to other private markets, infrastructure has a smaller interquartile \nspread than natural resources (12.9%), private equity (14.8%), and non-core real estate \n(10.8%), though it is still significantly larger than that for public US large cap equities \n(4.1%).12 The inclusion of core funds in the infrastructure composite may partly explain \nwhy the spread is lower than that for the other private market composites.\nfigure 10\nTrailing 10-Year \nInterquartile Spread\nSource: Data sourced from \nMorningstar and Cambridge \nAssociates via IHS Markit.

Another appealing \naspect of infrastructure is the potential for income generation, depending on the \nstrategy employed. The core and core plus strategies tend to offer meaningful income \npotential, whereas income is less targeted in value add and opportunistic strategies.\nDiversification from major asset classes\nInfrastructure’s correlation to both US bonds and equities has varied considerably \nsince 2008. On average, both core/core plus and non-core private infrastructure11  “Brownfield” assets are existing, \noperating assets needing \nimprovements, repairs, or \nexpansion. “Greenfield” assets do \nnot currently exist and need to \nbe built from scratch. \n12  Source: Data sourced from \nMorningstar and Cambridge \nAssociates via IHS Markit.

The extreme variability of the rolling 1-year correlation implies that there is no \nsignificant correlation between these asset classes. US equity also shows substantial \nvariability in its correlations with core/core plus and non-core infrastructure. However, \nthe average correlation is positive, at 0.55 and 0.63, respectively.13 This implies they are \nsomewhat correlated to equities, which seems intuitive as, in the long run, returns for \nboth sets of assets are likely to be driven by economic growth.\nfigure 11\nRolling 1-Year Correlation \nto US Bonds\nQuarterly returns sourced from \nBloomberg and Cambridge \nAssociates via IHS Markit as of \nJuly 2023.

Additionally, many infrastructure investments’ \nrevenue streams have explicit inflation links under contract or concession schemes.\nInfrastructure’s inflation protection benefit is evident in Figure 14 below. Both core/\ncore plus and non-core private infrastructure outperformed US equities in the \ninflationary scenarios, even generating positive returns. These inflationary scenarios \nare for the period Q2 2003 to Q4 2022, due to lack of data for earlier quarters. While \ninflation was low for the majority of this period, the spike in inflation near the end of \nthe period provided perhaps the first true test of infrastructure (and many other \nassets) as an inflation hedge. The analysis does not suggest that infrastructure will \nalways generate positive returns during future inflationary times. It implies that core/\ncore plus infrastructure is more responsive to inflation than non-core infrastructure, \nas would be expected since core/core plus tends to have a higher percentage of \ncontracted and otherwise inflation-linked revenues.\nfigure 14\nInflationary Scenarios\nThe inflationary scenarios analyzed \nwere over the period 4/1/2003 to \n12/31/2022 as this was the earliest \ndata available for core/core plus \nprivate infrastructure and gave \nthe largest time period to analyze \ninflationary periods over. Note that \nfund count from 4/1/2003 to 10/1/2007 \nis low, with less than 8 funds per \nstrategy.\nSource: Reflects average, annualized \nasset class returns. These figures \nare from Meketa’s scenario analysis \nbased on data from Cambridge \nAssociates via IHS Markit, Bloomberg, \nand FRED from 4/1/2003 to 12/31/2022. \nSee the appendix for more details on \nand descriptions of the inflationary \nperiods included in Meketa’s scenario \nanalysis. Implementation considerations\nThere are several implementation considerations that investors should be aware \nof when allocating to private infrastructure, including leverage, fund structure, \ninvestment vehicles, the J-curve, and fees.\nLeverage\nFor infrastructure, the amount of debt managers place on investments is typically \ndirectly related to the certainty and security of the revenue streams. As such, \ncore strategies will usually have the highest leverage (e.g., 40% to 50% at the fund \nlevel, and up to 80% or 90% for individual investments with solid cash flows). At \nthe opposite end of the risk spectrum, opportunistic strategies will typically use \nlittle to no long-term debt, but may, for example, use construction loans that are \ndrawn on, as needed, but not payable until completion. Value add strategies sit \nin between, typically having little to no leverage at entry, and using any loans for\nMEKETA.COM   |  BOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP PAGE 10 OF 14growth plans, facility expansions, and business optimization projects. As value add \ninvestments are de-risked and more cash is available for debt service, managers \nmay increase leverage commensurately. Infrastructure’s leverage profile across its \nrisk-return spectrum differs from that of real estate, with which investors may be \nmore familiar, where lower risk-return real estate assets have lower levels of leverage.\nFund structure and investment vehicles\nMost of the current universe of infrastructure funds are structured similarly to other \ntypes of private market partnerships (i.e., with a General Partner who is responsible \nfor investing and managing the fund and multiple limited partners who provide the \ncapital to be invested). They are closed-end private funds, generally with terms \nbetween 10 and 15 years, with the potential for several one-year extensions. They are \nstructured with an investment period of three to five years and will usually invest in \nfive to 15 assets or portfolio companies. Some funds have even longer terms of up to \n20 or 25 years and longer investment periods where the General Partner believes the \nstrategy requires more time to execute and/or if investors want longer hold periods \nin keeping with the underlying asset lives.\nThe infrastructure fund universe includes open-end vehicles with no specified term \nend that allows the manager indefinite hold periods and eliminates the imperative to \nexit investments, similar to the real estate asset class. Most open-end infrastructure \nfunds focus on core and core plus strategies, investing in assets that generate most \nof their return from cash yield. However, some open-end core funds do have a small \nallocation to development projects that reflect build-to-core strategies and other \ntypes of value add investments.\nSeparately managed accounts may be a potentially appealing investment vehicle for \nlarger investors who wish to have a more customizable strategy, often with lower fees. \nCo-investments or direct joint ventures can provide selective exposure to individual \nopportunities, typically with low or even no fees, but can increase concentration risks if \nnot sized appropriately relative to an investor’s overall infrastructure portfolio. These \nalternatives to commingled funds are primarily accessible to larger investors with \nsufficient in-house or outside resources and specialization to support the extra due \ndiligence and legal analysis these vehicles can involve. Still, more managers are offering \ncommingled co-investment vehicles that smaller investors can more readily access.\nJ-curve\nA characteristic that many infrastructure funds share with private equity partnerships \nis the J-curve. The J-curve is characterized by small negative returns early in an \ninvestment vehicle’s life that should turn positive with successful investments, thus \nmaking the graph of returns J-shaped. The J-curve occurs in situations where \nmanagement fees, and perhaps other expenses, are funded early in an investment’s \nhold period and not offset by revenues, profits, and/or capital appreciation until later \nin the fund’s life. This curve can be mitigated by strategies that generate income \nstreams from infrastructure assets upon or shortly after their acquisition. Hence, \nthe J-curve is generally less pronounced for infrastructure than for private equity \nMEKETA.COM   |  BOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP PAGE 11 OF 14strategies. Additionally, investors in open-end funds with existing investments will \ntypically face no J-curve, and investors in closed-end funds with seeded portfolios \nmay face a less steep J-curve relative to a blind pool offering.\nVintage year diversification\nVintage year diversification is just as important for infrastructure portfolios as for other \nasset classes. Different vintage years may experience varying economic conditions, \nmarket cycles, or performance trends. There is the potential for poor vintage year \ntiming when structuring an infrastructure program, just as in other areas of private \nmarkets. Missing out on a particularly good year, or overcommitting to a particularly \nbad one, will harm performance.\nBy diversifying across vintage years, investors can reduce the impact of poor performance \nin a particular year or economic environment. This helps to mitigate risk and minimize \nthe potential negative effects of a single vintage year’s underperformance. Therefore, \nvintage year diversification is important for a well-rounded infrastructure allocation. \nUsing pacing plans, following them, and regularly updating them, is considered a “best \npractice” for maintaining vintage year diversification.\nCapital deployment\nClosed-end infrastructure funds will typically call most of an investor’s commitment \nover a three- to five-year investment period, similar to other private market strategies. \nWhile most managers will be able to give investors periodic estimates of the pace of \nfuture capital calls, there will be some lack of predictability in the short term given the \nrate of deal flow, deal execution and closing, and forward activities.\nFurthermore, it is not uncommon to see the pace of deployment slow during economic \ndownturns or periods of uncertainty and accelerate during bull markets. The converse \ncan also be true where some deal flow picks up during times of distress and slows down \nwhen prices are richer. These dynamics can create challenges for investors in managing \nliquidity to fund capital calls as they are received, perhaps even on short notice.\nFees\nThe fees and additional expenses on private infrastructure funds are typically higher \nthan public market options, and generally include both a management fee and a \nperformance-based fee (a.k.a. “carry”) that kicks in above a pre-specified preferred return \n(a.k.a. “hurdle”), as with many private market investment vehicles. In comparison to other \nprivate markets asset classes, infrastructure is closer to the lower end of management \nfees (see Figure 15). Across infrastructure funds, the management fee and carry tend \nto be lower for core funds and higher for value add and opportunistic strategies. For \nexample, base management fees can range from 75 basis points up to 200 basis points, \ncarry from 0% to 20%, and hurdles from 0% to 9%, with a 50% to 100% catch up. Investors \nmaking large commitments often receive lower fee rates at one or more break levels.\nMEKETA.COM   |  BOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP PAGE 12 OF 14figure 15\nMean Management Fee \n(average 2005-2022)\nSource: Preqin, “2022 Private \nCapital Fund Terms Advisor,” as of \nSeptember 2022. Average annual \nmean management fee for the \nperiod 2005 to 2022.\nSummary\nAn allocation to private infrastructure may provide several benefits to institutional \nportfolios, from diversification and downside protection to serving as a hedge against \nasset depreciation during high inflationary periods.\nInfrastructure’s underlying assets have long useful lives and derive value from their \nintrinsic physical qualities. Since the asset class became more prominent in the early-\nto-mid 2000’s, the number of funds in the market each year has roughly tripled since \nthe Global Financial Crisis. However, infrastructure is still only a small piece of the \noverall private markets space, at an average of 9% of total AUM in the last ten years.\nInfrastructure encompasses a wide variety of strategies with respect to their level \nand type of risk, as well as their return potential. Core and core plus strategies target \nthe lowest risk-return level. Value add strategies target the middle of the risk-return \nspectrum, while opportunistic strategies target the highest risk-return. There are also \na multitude of sectors that infrastructure funds invest in, with many funds investing in \nmore than one sector. Both core/core plus and non-core private infrastructure have \nhistorically provided protection during inflationary periods where many traditional \nfinancial assets have depreciated in value. Both core/core plus and non-core private \ninfrastructure have also generated better returns than public equities during times \nof historical market downturns.\nFinally, the infrastructure asset class is accessible to institutional investors of all sizes, \nfrom the typical approach of investing via commingled partnerships, to the largest \ninvestors that can commit to separate accounts, co-investment vehicles, and direct \ninvestments. Investing in private infrastructure involves taking on risk as well as \nnavigating some challenges that are particular to most private markets. These challenges \ninclude, but are not limited to, the use of leverage, illiquidity, dispersion in fund returns \nby manager and vintage year, some lack of predictability around capital deployment, \nand fees that may create a meaningful gap between gross and net returns to investors.\nAs always, investors should conduct careful due diligence to make sure that \ninvestments match their objectives and constraints.\nMEKETA.COM   |  BOSTON  CHICAGO  LONDON  MIAMI  NEW YORK  PORTLAND  SAN DIEGO\n©2023 MEKETA INVESTMENT GROUP PAGE 13 OF 14Appendix\nMeketa’s inflation scenario analysis\n →Meketa’s Inflation Scenario Analysis is for the period April 2003 - December 2022.\n →The Scenario Analysis is based on a generalized linear regression (“GLS”) model \nthat estimates the effects of realized and surprise inflation on monthly asset \nreturns, controlling for the economic environment.

For the reasons set forth below, the \nDepartment’s Motion should be denied.  \nI. INTRODUCTION  \nThe Partners have produced for the Department and the other parties some of the most \nsensitive documents related to this transaction. One is a preliminary agreement between the \nPartners about  their plans for  joint ownership of  ALLETE , Inc. (“ALLETE”) , referred to in this \nResponse as Attachment 11.01 .1 The Department and other parties have access to this entire \ndocument , but the Department now argues  that the document should  be disclosed to the public. \n \n1 The Department refers to this document as “DOC IR SUPP 0011.01 Attach” and “ Ex. DOC -___, SLV -D-6” in their \nMotion.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 2 The Department’s request  would expose sensitive commercial information to competitors and \ncould result in material harm to the Partners , and  is legally incorrect. Public disclosure  of \nAttachment 11.01 i s not permitted because it  is both trade secret information pursuant to the \nMinnesota Government Data Practices Act (“MGDPA”), and Highly Confidential Trade Secret \nInformation (“HCTS information”) pursuant to the protective orders issued in this case.  \nThe other  dispute relates to  highly sensitive documents that each of  the Partners prepared \nto advise high -level decision -makers about whether to invest in ALLETE , known as Investment \nCommittee Memos (“IC Memos”) .2 The Department and other parties have access to the entire  IC \nMemos , except  for select  portions of the  IC Memos that are redacted to  protect  the Partners’  \nattorney -client privilege and attorney work product  information .3 Contrary to the Department ’s \narguments , the Partners made targeted  redactions in the IC Memos to protect information, and the \nPartners produced a comprehensive  privilege log to allow the Department to assess the \napplicability of the se privilege s. The Partners’ redactions were necessary to protect attorney work \nproduct and attorney -client privileged information and to avoid triggering a broader privilege \nwaiver.  \nFor these reasons, the Motion should be denied.  \nII. BACKGROUND  \nA. The Transaction  \n This case involves the proposed acquisition of ALLETE , owner of Minnesota Power, by \nCPP Investments and GIP. On May 5, 2024, ALLETE and the Partners entered an agreement by \n \n2 The Department refers to the IC Memos as the responses to Department Request Nos. 13 and 60  which include  DOC \nIR 13.02  Supp 3 HCTS, DOC IR 0060.01 Attach Supp HCTS, DOC IR 0060.02 Attach Supp HCTS, DOC IR 0060.03 \nSupp HCTS.  \n3 The Partners’ privilege log references three redactions made to comply with Canada’s  Personal Information \nProtection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA ”). See Barlow Decl ., Ex. D at  3-4, 8, 12. As explained in Kathryn \nEsaw’s Declaration, Canadian law requires these  redactions  in the absence of a legal or regulatory requirement to \ndisclose such personal information . See Esaw Decl . ¶ 14, n.1.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 3 which Partners would acquire ALLETE , including its Minnesota Power operating division and \nother  subsidiaries  (the “Acquisition”) . On July 19, 2024, Minnesota Power filed a petition  with the \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission (“Commission”)  seeking approval for the Acquisition . The \nCommission referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for a contested \ncase proceeding to further develop the factual record .4 The Partners have provided Attachment \n11.01 and the IC Memos to the parties pursuant to the Department’s  discovery requests.  \nB. Not Public Documents in Commission Proceedings  \n The protection of data in Commission proceedings is primarily controlled by the MGDPA , \nMinn. Stat. Chapter 13 . Once information is given to the Commission, OAH, or the Department, \nit is government data. Government data is treated as public unless it is classified as not public.5 \nOne type of not public data is “trade secret information,” which is defined as :  \n[G]overnment data . . . (1) that was supplied by the affected . . . organization, (2) \nthat is the subject of efforts by the . . . organization that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy, and (3) that derives independent economic \nvalue , actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily \nascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value \nfrom its disclosure or use.6 \n \nTrade secret information that is provided to the State is protected from public disclosure by law.  \n Given the large volumes of trade secret information involved in Commission matters, the \nCommission has a Rule about how protected data should be handled. Minn. Rule 7829.0500, subp. \n3 provides : \nWhen a person classifies an entire document, or a substantial part of a document, \nas protected data, the person shall file a description of the excised material that \n \n4 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment \nBoard and Global Infrastructure Partners , OAH Docket 25 -2500 -40339, MPUC Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198, \nORDER REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND GRANTING INTERVENTION , AND NOTICE OF AND ORDER FOR \nHEARING  (Oct. 7 2024), eDocket No. 202410 -210754 -01. \n5 Minn. Stat. §13.03, subd. 1 . \n6 Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b).  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 4 includes at least the following information: the nature of the material, its authors, \nits general import, and the date on which it was prepared.  \nMinn. Rule 7829.0500, subp. 5 provides that when protected data is filed with the Commission, it \nmust be accompanied by a “statement justifying the state agencies treating the data as protected \ndata,” including “an explanation of how the data is classified under the [MGDPA] or is privileged \nunder a rule of privilege recognized by law.”   \nCommission Rules do not require the submission of supplementary evidence to support the \n“statement” required to justify the classification of a document.  The Commission receives \nhundreds of protected filings each year,7 and they are generally  include “an accompanying \nstatement justifying” the treatment  that is  equivalent to what the Partners provided for Attachment \n11.01 and the IC Memos .”8  The statements justifying these filings , which the Commission \nroutinely accepts,  are equivalent to what the Partners provided in this proceeding s \nC. The Protective Orders  \n The parties to this proceeding , including the Partners and the Department, collectively  \nnegotiated and agreed to two protective orders  with different levels of protection . The two draft \n \n7 For example, during January 2025, the Commission received 96 filings in the eDockets system marked as protected. \nA search was conducted on www.edockest.state.mn.us  on the date range 1/1/25 to 1/31/25, and the results were sorted \nby “Class” to determine which were marked as trade secret.  \n8 See, e.g.,  CenterPoint Energy Purchased  Gas Adjustment Report – January 2025, MPUC Docket No. 25 -62 (Dec. \n30, 2024), eDocket No. 20412 -213375 -01 (restating  the text of Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b)) ; MPUC Docket No. \nPL-9/PPL -15-137, Line 3 Replacement Project Permit Compliance Filing (Jan. 29, 2025), eDocket No. 20251 -\n214608 -02 (restating the text of Minn.

Those orders were \nsubsequently issued without modification on December 5, 2024  and December 16, 2024 . \nThe Protective Order  (“Protective Order”)9 governs the disclosure of Protected Data, \nincluding  Trade Secret Information  as defined under the MGDPA . The Protective Order for Highly \nConfidential Trade Secret (“HCTS Protective Order”)10 governs the disclosure of Highly \nConfidential Trade Secret (“HCTS”) Information. The HCTS designation was created by \nagreement among the parties , following extensive negotiation,  to establish additional protections \nfor a small subset of documents that would cause a “serious business risk” if disclosed.   This use \nof multiple levels of protection is common in Commission cases.11 \nD. Produced Documents  \n1. Attachment 11.01  \nDOC I nformation Request  No. 11 (“IR 11”)  include d an extremely broad request for “all \ncontracts, agreements, etc.” between or among GIP Fund V and Tower Bridge that “govern the \nrelationship between the entities and/or define the rights of each party.”12 On November 26, 2024,  \nthe Partners provided  Attachment 11.01 to the Department and the OAG .13 While  the protective \norders had not yet been issued, in the interest of transparency and responsiveness, the Partners \nprovided Attachment 11.01 based on the definition of Highly Confidential Trade Secret  that the \n \n9 Protective Order (Dec. 5, 2024), eDocket No. 202412 -212750 -01. \n10 Protective Order for Highly Confidential Trade Secret Data (Dec. 16, 2024), eDocket No. 202412 -212992 -01. \n11 See, e.g., In the Matter of the Application of Xcel Energy for Authority to Increase Rates for Electric Service in \nMinnesota , OAH Docket No. 28 -2500 -40515, MPUC Docket No.  E-002/GR -24-320, Protective Order and Protective \nOrder for Highly Confidential Trade Secret Data (Jan. 27, 2025), eDocket No. 20251 -214424 -01; In the Matter of \nXcel Energy’s Competitive Resource Acquisition Process for up to 800 Megawatts of Firm Dispatchable Generation , \nOAH Docket No. 71 -2500 -39923, MPUC Docket  No. E-002/CN -23-212, Protective  Order  (May 8, 2024 ), eDocket \nNo. 20245 -206513 -01. \n12 Barlow Decl., Ex.

A.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 6 Department and the other parties  had agreed to in the proposed HCTS Protective Order .14 \nAttachment 11.01 is a preliminary agreement between the Partners [HCTS INFORMATION \nNOT FOR ALLETE BEGINS . . .]   \n  \n  [… HCTS INFORMATION NOT \nFOR ALLETE ENDS] In th eir supplemental response , the Partners  described the content of \nAttachment 11.01 , and explained that it met the factors to be treated as both Trade Secret under \nthe MGDPA and H CTS Information under the proposed  HCTS Protective Order .  \nAttachment 11.01 is a commercially sensitive document. As described in the Declaration s \nof Kathryn Esaw15 and Julie Ashworth16, the terms in the document were heavily negotiated \nbetween the Partners.  Its circulation within the Partners is very limited , and it has never been \ndisclosed publicly.17 Given the sensitivity of this document , its access has been limited to the \nexecutive leadership of ALLETE.18  \nFollowing the production on November 26, 2024, t he Partners did not hear any concerns \nfrom the Department about Attachment 11.01 , until the Department’s letter on February 7 \ndemanding that Attachment 11.01  be produced as a public document.19 The Partners declined .20 \n \n14 The Partners may have had valid grounds to withhold the production of Attachment 11.01 until the Protective Orders \nwere issued , but did not do so in order to be transparent and assist review of the Acquisition . Attachment 11.01 was \nproduced to other parties at the time they properly executed the HCTS NDAs required by the HCTS Protective Order.  \n15 Esaw Dec l. ¶ 3 \n16 Ashworth Dec. ¶ 3.  \n17 Esaw Decl, ¶ 8; Ashworth  Dec, ¶ 8. \n18 Attachment 11.01 is marked as HCTS NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO ALLETE in order to ensure appropriate \ncontrols over access to the data  during this proceeding . The executive  management team at ALLETE  with access to \nthis document is limited to  CEO, Vice President of Regulatory  & Legislative Affairs , Chief Legal Officer, Chief \nFinancial Officer,  and Vice President and Treasurer . \n19 Arnold Decl. , Ex. K. \n20 Arnold Decl. , Ex. L.   \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 7 2. IC Memos  \nIn response to the DOC Informati on Request s Nos. 13 (“IR 13”)  and 60 (“IR 60”) , the \nPartners have produced the IC Memos  to the Department  with a few narrowly tailored redactions \nto protect  attorney -client  privilege legal advice and attorney work product .21 IC Memos are \ncommercially sensitive documents in which investors present analysis, figures, calculations, \nprojections, and legal advice to investment committees regarding particular investments.22 While \nthe Department acknowledges some of the discussions regarding these documents, it does not \nexplain how, over the last several months, the Partners repeatedly sought to reach a compromise \nwith the Department, repeatedly asked the Department what infor mation it needed related to \nprivilege, and repeatedly attempted to provide the Department with that information —only to be \nmet with an additional demand for more information.  \nThe initial version of the IC Memos produced by the Partners on December 26 and 31, \n2024 included two categories of redactions : redactions to protect against disclosure of irrelevant \ninformation that could cause prejudice to the Partners or ALLETE and redactions to protect \nprivileged legal advice and confidential attorney work product. The Partners maintain that \nredaction of irrelevant information was justified .23 However, in the interest of transparency and \ncooperation, the Partners produced new versions of the IC Memos on January 18, 2025 containing \n \n21 Arnold Decl. , Ex. F, G, H, and I.  \n22 See Decs.  of Esaw and Gauss . The IC Memos are also commercially sensitive documents. Based upon the agreement \nand understanding of the Partners and ALLETE, the GIP IC Memo should not be shared with CPP Investments or \nALLETE; and the CPP Investments IC Memo should not be shared with G IP or ALLETE.  \n23 See, e.g., Kaiser Aluminum Warrick, LLC v. US Magnesium LLC, 2023 WL 2482933  (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2023) \n(“[I]f a party does not want to produce irrelevant and confidential information to an adversary and redactions can \navoid this result, a party should not necessarily be denied the opportunity to redact if redacting would not otherwise \nprejudice the other side or delay the case.”).   Redactions  of information that 1) is not relevant to the proceeding at \nhand and 2) could be prejudicial, is particular reasonable when the information is being disclosed to a regulatory \nagency and other parties who could seek to use the information in future proceed ings.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 8 only redactions related to privileged legal advice and attorney work product. These versions of the \nIC Memos are the subject of this dispute.  \nOn December 31, 2024, the Partners produced a log explaining the reason for each \nredaction.  In an email exchange from January 3 to January 7,24 the Department asserted that the \nlog provided on December 31 was insufficient and requested a meet and confer. The Department \ndid not identify any specific information that was lacking related to any particular privilege \nclaim.25 To understand what the Department was looking for, on January 6,  2025, the Partners \nrequested confirmation that the Department was requesting  “the identity of the preparer, the \nidentity of the recipients, and whether it is attorney -client privilege, work product, or another \nprivilege.” On January 7, Department counsel confirmed that the list “generally describe[d] the \ninformation [the Departmen t] believe[s] is necessary for us to evaluate the privilege.”26 \nThe Partners met with the Department on January 8, 2025 to discuss these concerns. During \na meeting on  January 10, 2024, the Partners shared an updated draft privilege log with the \nDepartment and requested feedback on whether the log would be sufficient or what information \nwould be required. The Department indicated that it wanted a “traditional privilege log.”27  \nOn January 15, 2025, the Department sent a letter to the Partners which  referred to a \n“traditional privilege log” but did not identify any specific information that the Department was \nrequesting.28 On January 21, 2025, the Partners provided an updated draft privilege log to the \nDepartment to see if it would be satisfactory, but did not hear back. On January 23, 2025, the \nPartners produced the updated privilege log to all parties .29 \n \n24 Arnold Decl. , Ex. D.  \n25 Id. \n26 Id. \n27 Arnold Decl. ¶ 10. The Department’s Declaration incorrectly states  that this meeting took place on January 9, 2025, \nbut this typographical error has no bearing  on the matters in dispute . \n28 Arnold Decl. , Ex. E.  \n29 Arnold Decl. , Ex. J.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 9  Several weeks later, on February 7, 2025, the Department sent the Partners a letter \ndemanding that the Partners abandon their privilege claims.30 In order to avoid waiving their right \nto protect privileged information, the Partners declined to do so.31 \nIII. ARGUMENT  \nA. Standard of Review  \nThe categorization of Attachment 11.01  as trade secret  information and HCTS Information \nis controlled by the Protective Orders issued in this case, and by the MGDPA. Attachment 11.01 \nis properly categorized based on both these sources of authority, and the Department’s request  \nwould result in a violation of both the Protective Orders and the MGDPA.  \nAs it relates to the privileges in the IC Memos, the  Motion is subject to Rule 1400.6700, \nwhich provides that any means of discovery available in the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure \nare allowed. Rule 1400.6700 further provides, however, that in order to prevail on a motion to \ncompel the Department must “s how[] that the discovery is needed for the proper presentation of \nthe [Department’s] case, is not for purposes of delay, and that the issues or amounts in controversy \nare significant enough to warrant th e discovery. In ruling on a discovery motion, the judge shall \nrecognize all privileges recognized at law.” The  Motion does not meet this standard.  \nB. HCTS Designation of Attachment 11.01  \n1. Attachment 11.01 is Protected from Public Disclosure by the Protective \nOrder and by Minnesota Law  \nThe Department argues that Attachment 11.01 should not be treated as protected data and \nshould be disclosed to the public.  The Department’s argument is extreme.  The Department and \nother parties already have access to this document and can make use of it in their testimony and \n \n30 Arnold Decl. , Ex. K.  \n31 Arnold Decl. , Ex. L.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 10 throughout the case. Despite its unfettered access to the document, and despite  being told that \npublic disclosure of this document would result in significant business harm to the Partners, the \nDepartment now demands that the Partners disclose their trade secrets to the public . The \nDepartment’s request could have a chilling effect on the willingness of businesses to engage with \nregulated utilities in the state. This chilling effect can be avoided because there is no basis in law \nor fact for the Department’s  request, as Attachment 11.01 is trade secret —and thus protected from \npublic disclosure —under both the Protective Order32 and the MGDPA.33 \nThere is no doubt that Attachment 11.01 is trade secret information. Data provided to the \nstate is trade secret information when three factors are satisfied: 1) it was supplied by the affected \norganization; 2) it was the subject of efforts by the organizat ion that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy; and 3) it derives independent economic value, actual or \npotential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means \nby, other persons who can obt ain economic value from its disclosure or use .34 Attachment 11.10 \nsatisfies each of these factors.  \nThe Partners supplied Attachment 11.01 to the Department in response to IR 11.35  \nThe Partners have taken extensive efforts to maintain the secrecy of this document. The \nPartners explained that Attachment 11.01 is maintained as a trade secret at the time it was produced \nto the Department .36 Its circulation is limited within the Partner entities, available only to the \nexecutive leadership team of ALLETE, and it has never  been released publicly to anyone.37 \n \n32 The Protective Order defines Protected Data as including “trade secret information” within the meaning of Minn. \nStat. 13.37, subd. 1(b).  \n33 Minn. Stat. §§ 13.01 -13.991.  \n34 Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 1(b).  \n35 Motion at 2.  \n36 Dec. of Barlow, Ex. A. \n37 Decl. Ashworth  ¶ 8; Decl.  of Esaw ¶ 14. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 11 Attachment 11.01 derives independent economic value because  of its secrecy and because \ncompetitors do not have access to the information in the document. Contrary to the arguments of \nthe Department, this is not a standard corporate document. As explained in the Declaration s of \nEsaw and Gauss , Attachment 11.01 spells out how the Partners seek to structure their transactions, \ntheir competitive sensitivities, and what the Partners view as critical terms.  Public  disclosure of  \nAttachment 11.01 would give competi tors a roadmap and an unfair competitive advantage  for \nnegotiating against the Partners in future transactions. Attachment 11.01 also explains rights that \nPartners have negotiated and agreed to related to their ownership . For that reason, public disclosure \ncould have negative impacts on future negotiations relating  to this transaction  by exposing critical \ndetails and timing provisions that the Partners have negotiated in confidence.  Releasing the \ndocument publicly would materially harm the Partners and impair their ability to effectively \nnegotiate transactions in the future. Attachment 11.01 derives economic value primarily because \nof its confidential nature, and public disclosure would destroy that value and materially harm the \nPartners.   \nAs such, Attachment 11.01 falls squarely within the definition of trade secret information \nunder MGDPA  and the Protective Order.  Because Attachment 11.01 is trade secret, its public \ndisclosure is prohibited.38 \nThe Department suggest s that the Partners have failed some evidentiary burden required to \ndemonstrate that documents are trade secret, but the Department does not cite to any provision of \nthe MGDPA or the protective orders that requires  supplemental evidence to mark information as \nprotected data.  As noted above, the information provided with the initial production of Attachment \n11.01 reflects  what is normally provided in MPUC proceedings, and which the Department \n \n38 Protective Order ¶ 5; Minn. Stat. § 13.37, subd. 2(a) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 12 routinely accepts.39 It is also consistent with what is required by the Commission’s Rules, which \nrequire only an “accompanying statement justifying the state agencies treating the data as protected  \ndata” and “an explanation of how the data is classified under the MGDPA.”40 Where an entire \ndocument is protected, the Commission’s Rules require identification of only the nature of the \nmaterial, its general important, and the date on which it was prepared.41 The Commission’s Rules, \nand general practice before the Commission, do not contemplate an evidentiary requirement at the \ntime protected data is produced or filed.  To the extent that additional information is required, the \ninformation in the Declaration s of Esaw and Ashworth  are sufficient to demonstrate that \nAttachment 11.01 is trade secret information.  \nThe Motion also suggests  that the public holds a common -law right to inspect Attachment \n11.01. This contention is incorrect . Even if there were a right for public inspections in \nadministrative proceedings, it would not apply to documents that are properly sealed pursuant to a \nprotective order, or where disclosure is prohibited by the MGDPA.  In fact, the MGDPA includes \na specific remedy when circulation of not public data is required as a result for administrative \ndiscovery. Minn. Stat. § 13.03,  subd. 6 prov ides that the presiding officer may issue a protective \norder to “assure proper handling of the data by the parties,” exactly as has been done here. In short, \nto the extent that an administrative proceeding requires the production of not public data, the proper \nstep is for the presiding officer to issue a protective order to allow its use during the proceeding \nbut protect it from further disclosure —precisely as has occurred in this case.  \n \n39 See infra  note 8. \n40 Minn. R. 7829. 0500 , subp 5.  Commission Rules  further clarify that “nothing in [the Commission’s Rules of Practice \nand Procedure] require[] public disclosure of protected data or any disclosure of privileged data.” Minn. R. 7824.0500, \nsubp. 1. \n41 Minn. R. 7829. 0500 , subp. 3. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 13 Attachment 11.01 is trade secret, and the Department’s Motion to require public disclosure \nmust be denied because it is prohibited by the Protective Orders and the MGDPA.  \n2. Attachment 11.01  is Highly Confidential Trade Secret Information in its \nEntirety  \nIn addition to being trade secret information under the MGDPA, Attachment  11.01 is also \nHCTS Information under the HCTS Protective Order. The HCTS Protective Order , which the \nDepartment negotiated and agreed to,  defines  HCTS Information as “all information related to  … \ncommercial arrangements or agreements that may affect future negotiations or transactions of the \ndisclosing party .”42 HCTS Information must not be disclosed to any person who has not executed \nthe appropriate Non -Disclosure Agreement, and certainly must not be made public.  \nPursuant to the HCTS Protective Order, HCTS Information includes, among other things, \n“all information, related to: a) commercial arrangements or agreements that may affect future \nnegotiations or transactions of the disclosing party.”43 Attachment 11.01 squarely meets this \nprovision.   \nAttachment 11.01 is clearly a commercial agreement and there is no reasonable dispute \nabout that fact.  \nAttachment 11.01  “may affect future negotiations or transactions ,” both between the \nPartners , and in potential future transactions . As the Partners explained in writing when producing \nAttachment 11.01 (a document that the Department did not provide to the Court but that is attached \nhere) ,44 Attachment 11.01  [HCTS INFORMATION NOT FOR ALLETE BEGINS …]  \n  \n  \n \n42 HCTS Protective Order ¶ 3.  \n43 HCTS Protective  Order ¶ 3. \n44 Barlow Dec l., Ex. B . \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 14  \n  \n  \n  [… \nHCTS INFORMTION NOT FOR ALLETE ENDS]  These facts are explained in more detail in \nthe Declaration s of Esaw and Ashworth . As joint owners of ALLETE, the Partners will need to \ncontinuously cooperate regarding management of their investment. The content of their \npreliminary agreement about how to do so  could affect the future negotiations between the Partners \nrelated to this transaction.  \nAttachment 11.01 could also affect future transactions entirely unrelated to ALLETE or \nMinnesota  for each of the Partners.45 As the Partners  have repeatedly explained to the Department, \nAttachment 11.0 1 identifies sensitive provisions that would be heavily negotiated in any \ntransactions of this nature . Information about  which terms were acceptable to each of  the Partners, \nor even which terms the Partners felt the need to negotiate , is relevant to how the Partners would \nconduct negotiations for future transactions, either together or separately. Publicly disclosing this \ninformation to competitors would place the Partners at a significant disadvantage in this highly \ncompetitive field. Most recently, in our February 11 letter, Partners  even identified specific critical \nterms in Attachment 11.01 the disclosure of which could  disadvantage the Partners.46  Disclosure \nof the specific terms that the Partners negotiated, what positions they were willing to agree to, and \nthe specific structure of how the preliminary agreement was reached, could negatively impact the \nability of either Partner to negotiate similar deals in the future.  Given the magnitude of the \n \n45 See Decl s. of Esaw and Ashworth . \n46 Arnold Decl. , Ex. L.  \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 15 transactions the Partners engage in, competitors eagerly seek any advantages and being placed at \na disadvantage could materially impact the Partners.  \nTo the extent there is any doubt as to whether Attachment 11.01 is properly marked as \nHCTS Information, it is also “related to . . . commercially sensitive . . . forward -looking business \nplans.”47 As explained, [HCTS INFORMATION NOT FOR ALLETE BEGINS …] \n  \n  \n  \n  [… HCTS INFORMATION NOT FOR ALLETE \nENDS]  \nThe Partners did not casually mark this document as HCTS Information. The Partners have \nproduced over 137 documents as attachments in this proceeding, and only 25 of them are marked \nas HCTS. As required by the HCTS Protective Order, the Partners “scrutinize[d] carefully” \ndocuments responsive to the Department’s requests and have limited their designation of HCTS \nInformation to information that “truly might impose a serious business risk” if disseminated \nwithout heightened protections.48 The nature of this business risk is described in the Declarations \nof Esaw and Ashworth .49  \nAttachment 11.01 is properly marked as HCTS Information based on the HCTS Protective \nOrder, which the Department agreed to.   \n \n47 HCTS Protective Order ¶ 3.  \n48 HCTS Protective Order ¶ 6.  \n49 Decl. of Esaw ¶¶ 2–8; Decl. of Ashworth ¶¶ 5 –7. \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 16 3. The Partners Will Provide More Public Information about Future \nGovernance of ALLETE  \nWhile the Department’s legal argument for public disclosure of Attachment 11.01 should \nbe rejected, the Partners understand that the Department has requested, in its Direct Testimony, \nmore information about how ALLETE will be governed in the future. The Pa rtners intend to  \nprovide this information in Rebuttal Testimony —the proper venue for responding to requests \nraised in intervenor direct , and one that can be pursued without forcing the public disclosure of \ncritically sensitive commercial documents.  \n4. Request for Stay in the Event of an Adverse Decision  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Department’s Motion related to Attachment 11.01 should be \ndenied. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, the Partners request that the ALJ stay the effect \nof the ruling so that the Partners can seek judicial review.50 \nC. The Partners Properly Asserted Privilege  for Information Redacted from \nRequest Nos. 13 and 60   \nThe Department claims  that the  Partners failed to establish that redacted portions of the IC \nMemos  are privileged . The Department  alleges  that the Partners rely on unrecognized privileges , \nor in  the alternative, that the Partners did not  “sufficiently detail the nature of the withheld \nmaterials ” to evaluate whether a privilege applied.51 Neither one of these criticisms is accurate. \nContrary  to the Department’s claims,  the Partners redact ed select  portions of the IC Memos  that \nthe Partners produced in response  to Document Request No s. 13 and 60  based on the work -product \nand attorney -client privileges . The Partners ’ privilege log properly identified  these redactions  and \n \n50 See Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 108.02, subd. 1 (requiring a party to request a stay from the trial court before seeking a \nstay on appeal) ; see also  Protective Order ¶ 13 ( “Protected data for which a designation is removed shall not be made \npublic until five (5) days after the determination, or another time as determined by the Administrative Law Judge, to \nprovide an opportunity to seek further review of the determination.”) . \n51 Motion at  5. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 17 included information required to assess the applicability of the privilege pursuant to Minn. R. Civ. \nP. 26 .02(f)(1) . For these reasons, the Motion fails.   \n1. The Redact ions are Narrowly Targeted to  Protect Privileged Information  \nThe IC Memos are sensitive commercial documents. They represent the best analysis of \nthe Partners about whether to invest in ALLETE. Their structure and content is competitively \nsensitive and has not been shared even with the other Partner , including the non -redacted portions . \nDespite these sensitivities, the Partners provided these documents to the Department and other \nparties with narrowly tailored redactions to protect privileged information. The Department and \nother parties have access to the vast majority of the content of the IC Memos , and t he redactions \nare limited to a few pages and pro visions throughout lengthy and complex documents.   \n2. The Redacted Information Was Properly Withheld  as Privileged  \nThe Department first contends that the Partners  withheld  redacted materials  responsive to \nDocument Re quest Nos. 13 and 60 based on  “unrecognized privileges.”52 In support of this \nargument, the Department cites  In re Polaris, Inc. , 967 N.W.2d 397 (Minn. 2021)53 to argue that  \nthe Partners  cannot  assert the attorney -client privilege to protect “business advice. ”54 Because the \nDepartment mischaracterizes the privileges underlying the Partners’ redactions and the legal \nstandard from  In re Polaris , the Motion fails.  \nThe Partners’  redactions in the IC Memos  do not rely on “unrecognized privilege s.”55 Each \nentry  in the  privilege log under the “Legal Basis” column states that the redactions are based on \nthe attorney work product and  attorney -client privilege .56 The Department  ignores these entries  \n \n52 Motion at  5. \n53 While the Acquisition is sometimes referred to as the Polaris project in documents produced in discovery, In re \nPolaris, Inc.  is not in any way related to the Acquisition.  \n54 Motion at 5. \n55 Motion at 5. \n56 See Arnold Decl. Ex. J-1, J-3, J-6, and J -7. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 18 and argues that  the Partners  “broadly assert  that the redacted materials relate  to future regulatory \ncompliance [.]”57 The Department has not cited to any legal authority that stands for the proposition \nthat the attorney -client privilege does not protect legal advice concerning future regulatory \ncompliance . The only case they did cite,  In re Polaris , does not stand for this proposition either.  \nIn re Polaris addressed whether Polaris could assert the  attorney -client pr ivilege as a basis \nto withhold producing an entire safety -related audit report that Polaris had commissioned a law \nfirm to prepare  in August of 2016 .58 In August of 2017, the respondent had filed a lawsuit against \nPolaris for burns he had suffered when his Polaris RZR vehicle started on fire , and during \ndiscovery, Polaris inadvertently produced a copy of this report.59 The special master assigned to \nthe case denied Polaris’s attempt to claw back the report in its entirety but —most applicable to the \ndispute at hand —acknowledged that it was appropriate to redact limited sections of the report \ncontaining  legal opinions that interpreted  federal  Consumer Product Safety Commission \nregulations.60 The district court  affirmed the special master’s decision, and the Minnesota Court \nof Appeals denied Polaris’ writ of prohibition.61 \nThe Minnesota Supreme Court granted  Polaris’s petition for review  to determine “w hether \na corporate report that contains both legal advice and business advice is protected in its entirety by \nthe attorney -client privilege. ”62 At the outset, the Court acknowledged that the report contained \nboth legal and business advice.63 The Court then adopted the “predominant purpose test” which \nonly permits the attorney -client privilege to justify withholding an  entire document if “the \n \n57 Motion at 5. \n58 In re Polaris, Inc. , 967 N.W.2d at 403.  \n59 Id. \n60 Id. at 404.  \n61 Id.  \n62 Id. at 407.  \n63 Id.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 19 predominant purpose of the communication is to render or solicit legal advice.”64 With this \nholding, the Court recognized that portions of legal advice within a document could still be \nprotected: “ We stress, however, that even when the predominant purpose of the communication is \nbusiness advice, the attorney -client privilege will protect any portions of the document that contain \nlegal advice. ”65 \nThat is exactly what the Partners have done here. The Partners did not  withhold an entire \ndocument . Instead , the Partners produced the IC Memos  with targeted  redactions of work product \nand attorney -client privilege information , align ing with the holding from  In re Polaris  that permits  \nredactions for legal advice .66 The Department ignore s this holding  from In re Polaris and cites to \none line where the Court noted that “[t]he attorney -client privilege  ‘does not apply if the client \nseeks regulatory advice for a business pur pose.’”67 But t he information redacted from the IC \nMemos  is not “regulatory advice for a business purpose.” The redactions focus on legal advice and \nwork -product related the decision to invest,  regulatory approvals required to close on the \nAcquisition , and future regulatory filings  or approvals following  the closing . This treatment is \nentirely consistent with In re Polaris , in which the Supreme Court confirmed that legal advice \nrelated to regulatory issues should be treated as privileged even when it is contained in a document \nthat is primarily for a different p urpose.68 While this is a “regulatory” proceeding, the Partners \nobtained  legal advice from attorneys when  deciding whether to move forward with the Acquisition , \nwhich  should not be surprising given the gravity of the Acquisition and the finances  involved . \n \n64 Id.  \n65 Id. at 408.  \n66 Id.  \n67 Id. at 411 (citing Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Abbvie, Inc. , No. 14 -5151, 2015 WL 8623076, at *9 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 14, \n2015) ). \n68 Id. at 408.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 20 These redactions protect that advice, and , if necessary,  an in camera review of the IC Memos  will \nconfirm that the Partners ’ redactions align with  In re Polaris . \nBecause the Partners’ redactions constitute legal advice that is properly redacted under the \nconfines of In re Polaris , the Department has no legal basis to  compel the Partners to produce the \nIC Memos  without redactions.  \n3. The Privilege Log Is Detailed , Provides Enough Information for the Parties \nto Assess the Applicability of the Privilege  Claim , and  the Updated \nPrivilege Log  Submitted Concurrent with this Response Further Support s \nthe Partners ’ Privilege Claim  \nThe Department claims that the Partners did not provide a privilege log sufficient ly detail ed \nto evaluate the privilege designation of documents.69 The Department is incorrect: the Partners \ndisclosures are consistent with the Minnesota and federal rules of civil procedure  and provide  more \nthan enough  detail for the Department to verify that the Partners’  redactions were  appropriate .  \nThe Partners maintain that the previously provided privilege log is sufficient. However, t o \naddress one of the Department’s main  concerns regarding these redactions , the Partners provide \nwith this Response an updated log providing additional information  regarding the attorneys that \nprepared the legal advice and the individuals  at CPP Investments  and GIP that received the \ndocuments in question.70 This additional information conclusively establishes  that the Partners \nappropriately redacted attorney work product and attorney -client privileged information from the \nIC Memos.  \nAt the outset , there is no rule requiring the creation of privilege logs in MPUC proceedings, \nand they are not commonly requested or provided. There is no body of law or standard practice for \nwhen they should be required or what they should include.  They are largely impractical in settings \n \n69 Motion at 6. \n70 Barlow Decl., Ex. D. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 21 where, as here, the quantity of discovery is unlimited and the discovery response timeline is 8 or \n10 days , procedures which are very different from civil litigation.  Despite the novelty of the \nDepartment’s request for a log, the Partners attempted in good faith to provide the information \nnecessary to assess the appropriateness of the privilege redactions.  \nMore substantively, even in civil proceedings “[t]here is no ‘privilege log’ rule” and “the \nprivilege log is a convention of modern legal practice designed to conform with the requirements \nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5).” Bartholomew v. Avalon Capital Group , Inc., 278 \nF.R.D. 441, 447 (D. Minn. 2011). While some form of privilege log or index generally  is required  \nin civil court , “the degree of specificity required with respect  to the preparation of a log or index \nis dictated by the needs  of eac h case.” See Glover v. Standard Federal Bank , No. 97 -CV-2068, \n2001 WL 629631, at *2 (D. Minn. June 5, 2001).  Like the federal rules ,71 Minn. R. Civ. P. \n26.02(f) (1) requires a party asserting privilege to describe the nature of the documents “in a manner \nthat, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess \nthe applicability of the privilege or protection.” Here, t he Partners met and exceeded  the disclosure \nrequirements from both the Minnesota and federal rules of civil procedure .  \nFor each redaction in the IC Memos , the Partners ’ January  23, 2025 privilege log identifies \nthe redacted information as legal advice, not business advice; identifies the general topic of the \nlegal advice; identifies the legal counsel that provided the advice; and identifies that the advice \nwas received by the relevant Partner and not disclosed to an yone else.72 Furthermore, t he January \n23, 2025  privilege log states that the identified work product was prepared in anticipation of \n \n71 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(A) (“When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable by claiming that the \ninformation is privileged or subject to protection as trial -preparation material, the party must: (i) expressly make the \nclaim; and (ii) describe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed —\nand do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to \nassess the claim.”)  \n72 See generally Arnold Decl. Ex. J.  \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 22 litigation, which includes this regulatory proceeding.73 The ALJ can verify the veracity of these \nrepresentations through an in camera  review  if necessary . \nWithout citation to any legal authority, the Department contends that the Partners’ privilege \nlog must  identify the specific author and recipient of the redacted information.74 Under  the \nMinnesota and federal rules of civil procedure , a party is only required to describe the nature of \nthe documents in a manner that helps the other party assess whether the privilege  applies .75 \nImposing such a stringent requirement has no place in the rules of civil procedure and is not needed \nhere to assess whether the privilege applies.  See Oxygenator Water Technologies, Inc. v. Tennant \nCompany , No. 20 -cv-0358 (KMM/HB), 2022 WL 22886713, at *4 (D. Minn. Ma r. 31, 2022) \n(finding that “if the information is not reasonably available, the log is not deficient simply because \nan attorney was not identified”) . In this case, the IC Memos are not emails or simple memos with \nfew senders and recipients. Man y attorneys from multiple firms collaborated to produce the advice \nin question , and identifying them specifically by name does not provide any benefit in assessing \nwhether the information is legal advice.  \nEven though n either rule requires  the Partners  to disclose  the specific names of attorneys \nwho provided legal advice or specifically name the individuals who received the advice , the \nPartners  provide this information in the updated privilege log attached to this Response.  As \ndemonstrated by this updated privilege log and the Declarations of Esaw and Ashworth, there is \nmore than enough information to confirm that the work product and attorney -client privilege \napplies to the Partners’ redactions.  \n \n73 See, e.g. , Arnold Decl. Ex. J -1, J-3, J-6, and J -7 (“The redacted information reflects confidential legal advice and  \ncommunications related to the acquisition and ongoing and future regulatory or litigation matters.”).  \n74 Id. at 6 (“Here, the Partners’ privilege log fails to identify with any specificity the author of redacted information or \na complete list of recipients of the redacted information.”).  \n75 See Minn. R. Civ. P. 26.02(f)(1) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5) (A); see also See Oxygenator Water Technologies, Inc. v. \nTennant Company , No. 20 -cv-0358 (KMM/HB), 2022 WL 22886713, at *4 (D. Minn. Ma r. 31, 2022) (finding that \n“if the information is not reasonably available, the log is not deficient simply because an attorney was not identified”) . \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 23 The Department  also claim s that the Partners’ privilege log should have provided “the \nmetadata [that] would be necessary to verify the claimed authors or recipients.”76 The \nDepartment’s written discovery never  request ed metadata , and the Department never once \nrequested metadata for these specific IC Memos  during the parties’ multiple meet -and-confer \nconferences on this issue .77 \nWhile metadata is discoverable, courts have generally only ordered “the production of \nmetadata when it is sought in the initial document request and the producing party has not yet \nproduced the documents in any form.” Aguilar v. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Div., U.S. \nDep't of Homeland Sec ., 255 F.R.D. 350, 357 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) . Because the Department never \nrequested metadata before bringing this Motion, it is not entitled to do so here. See also, e.g., In re \nProsche Cars N. Am., Inc., Plastic Coolant P rods. Litig ., 279 F.R.D. 447, 449 n.5 (S.D. Ohio \n2012) (“If the requesting party does not specify a form, therefore, the producing party is within its \nright to produce the ESI in static image form (TIFF or PDF) with no metadata.”); Mr. Mudbug, \nInc. v. Bloomin’ Brands, Inc ., No.15 -CV-5265, 2017 WL 111268, at *3 (E.D. La. Jan. 11, 2017) \n(disagreeing with the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff should have to produce metadata as \nthe defendant did not make a request for metadata in its request for productio n of documents); \nWyeth v. Impax Labs., Inc ., 248 F.R.D. 169, 170 -72 (D. Del. 2006) (“Ordinarily, courts will not \ncompel the production of metadata when a party did not make that a part of its request.”).   \nThe Department’s  argument on this point  also misconstrues what metadata would reveal. \nTeams of attorneys worked on and provided input for these IC Memos .78 Metadata would not \nidentify all the other individuals who worked on and helped provide input for these presentations. \n \n76 Motion at  6. \n77 Barlow Decl. ¶ 11. \n78 See Arnold Decl. Ex. J -1, J-3, J-6, and J -7. \nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 24 Metadata only capture s the identity of the original author or anyone who added tracked changes to \nthe document.  \nFinally, the Department suggests that the Partners have attempted to hide business advice \nbehind claims of legal privilege. That is not the case. [HCTS INFORMATION  NOT FOR \nALLETE OR GIP  BEGINS …]  \n  \n \n  \n  \n   [… HCTS \nINFORMATION NOT FOR ALLETE OR GIP ENDS]  As identified on the privilege log, that \npage of the CPP Investments IC Memo includes legal advice, prepared by attorneys for CPP \nInvestments, “reflect[ing] near -term action items to address legal and compliance issues and risks, \nidentified by internal and external counsel during the diligence process.” While the Partners are \npurchasing ALLETE together, their operations and practices are different and their IC Memos are \nconstructed differently.  If necessary, a n in camera review of this document will confirm that the \nPartners made appropriate reactions for information protected by the work product and attorney -\nclient privilege.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n The Partners request that the ALJ deny the Department’s Motion. Attachment 11.01 is \nproperly classified as HCTS and trade secret and must not be disclosed to the public. The limited \nredactions to the IC Memos are narrowly targeted to protect privileged legal advice and attorney \nwork product, and the Declarations and updated  privilege log  are sufficient  to confirm that the \nwork production and attorney -client privilege applies . \n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS  – NOT PUBLIC DATA HAS BEEN EXCISED  \n 25  In addition, if the ALJ orders the public disclosure of Attachment 11.01, the Partners \nfurther request that the ALJ pre -emptively stay the effect of the decision so that disclosure does \nnot take place before the Partners have an opportunity to request a stay.  \n \nDated: February 28, 2025   Respectfully submitted,  \n \n  By:  /s/ Ryan P.

Attachment 11.01, as defined in the Respons e, is a bespoke term sheet between \nCPP Investments and its partner- investor, GIP (together , the “Partners”) regarding the Partners’ \nacquisition of ALLETE.  The Part ners negotiated the terms of Attachment 11.01 extensively and \nat arms-length.  Among other thi ngs, these terms, which are subj ect to further negotiation and \nadjustment, concern how the Partners intend to  organize their relati onship as co-owners of \nALLETE, how that relationship woul d be carried through  during their co-own ership, and certain \nrights of the Partners. \n4. CPP Investments executed Attachment 11.01 w ith the expectation and on the basis \nthat its contents would remain strictly confidential. \n5. CPP Investments has a robust pipeline of  transaction opportunities and commonly \nnegotiates governance and other st ructuring terms with buyers, se llers and co-investors on those \ntransactions.  Maintaining the c onfidentiality of Att achment 11.01 and its terms is critical to CPP \nInvestments’ ability to compete with other investors in those s ituations.  Making this strategic \ninformation available publicly would materially harm CPP Investments as it negotiates or pursues \nother transactions, as potential acquisition targets and other part ner-investors would have highly-\nsensitive competitive information about how CPP Investments seeks to structure its transactions \nand partnerships, and what CPP Investments may be willing to agree to for certain critical \ncommercial terms (including, among other things, with respect to govern ance, consent rights, \ntransfers/liquidity, registration ri ghts, public offerings, tax struct uring and information rights).  \nThis would place CPP Investments at  a significant competitive disadva ntage in future transactions, \nand would inure to the benefit of  CPP Investments’ competitors. \n6. The secrecy of certain negotiated rights of  the Partners, includi ng with respect to \nconsent rights, transfers/liquidity, registration ri ghts and public offerings is  important because the \n \n \n \nUS-DOCS\\157666135.5 Term Sheet describes the mechanics for how an i nvestor may transfer their ownership stake and \nunder what conditions (and/or with what approvals as applicable).  Public disclosure of these \nrights, terms and arrangements ri sks significantly disadvantaging Pa rtners when interacting with \ncompetitors seeking a material  advantage in negotiations.  \n7. The Term Sheet also describes funding me chanics for CPP Inve stments, including \nadditions of new capital, distributions, and the manner in which these mechanics may alter the \nrelative investor ownership in ALLETE.  Unders tanding how investor ownership may change over \ntime provides compet itors, opportunistic invest ors, and lenders (among others) a picture of the \nrelative arrangements that may impact the fina ncial position, now and in  the future, of CPP \nInvestments. \n8. Because of Attachment 11.01’s signifi cant commercial sensitivity, CPP \nInvestments has not disclosed the document outside  of this proceeding to anyone not employed at \nor representing the Partners, aside from CFIUS.   I am not aware of any means by which an \nunauthorized third party, including any of CPP Investments’ compet itors, could obta in Attachment \n11.01.  Privileges and DOC Information Request 60  \n9. As part of my role at CPP Investments, I participated in the preparation of the CPP \nInvestments Investment Committee memo (“ IC Memo”) produced as Project Alloy Final \nInvestment Recommendation . CPP Investment’s IC Memo wa s produced in response to DOC \nInformation Request 60. \n10. An IC Memo is a critical and sensitive document. It is typically prepared to provide \na recommendation to the investment committee of  CPP Investments as to whether to pursue a \n \n \n \nUS-DOCS\\157666135.5 particular investment and to seek approval for an investment team to enter into documentation to \neffect the associated transacti on. The IC Memo includes technical analysis, projectio ns, estimates, \nand other considerations regarding the potential transaction, including rele vant legal advice and \nwork product. \n11. In preparing the IC Memo, CPP Investme nts requested and received legal advice \nand work product related to the potential transac tion from in-house counse l and outside counsel. \nCPP Investments requested legal advice and work product from its counsel on issues involving: \nfederal and state regulatory re quirements, future federal a nd state regulatory proceedings \n(including this proceeding), federal and state re gulatory risks, analysis of compliance with \napplicable laws, and regarding ce rtain aspects of the transaction.  CPP Investments’ counsel also \ndirected non-legal personnel at CPP Investments to do work relati ng to legal matters, which was \nalso used to form legal advice and recommendations. \n12. In-house and outside counsel , including attorneys fro m Latham & Watkins LLP \n(“Latham”), Torys LLP, Freshfields, Squire Patton Boggs, Dorsey & Whitney LLP, and Moss & \nBarnett provided the requested legal advice and work product, wh ich CPP Investments ultimately \nincorporated in the IC Memo. \n13. CPP Investments’ outside counsel, Latham , redacted this advice and work product \nbefore producing the IC Memo to the Department. \n14. To my knowledge, CPP Investments has not disclosed any of the privileged \ninformation in the IC Memo to anyone other th an members of CPP Inve stments’ investment \ncommittee, members of the CPP Investments board of  directors, outside lega l counsel, and certain \nCPP Investments employees.  Access to this in formation for CPP Invest ments’ employees was \ngranted on a “need to know” basis, which included  members of the inves tment team engaged on \n \n \n \nUS-DOCS\\157666135.5 this transaction, employees whose access to the memo was necessary for the origination, \nexecution, management and/or executive manageme nt of the tran saction, and employees whose \naccess was necessary to discharge their responsibi lities or accountabilities in relation to the \ntransaction.1  \n \n  \nI declare under penalty of perjury that everything I have stated in this document is true and \ncorrect to the best  of my knowledge.  \n Dated:  February 28, 2025                                                                                                                                              s/ Kathryn Esaw                  \n                                                                                                Kathryn Esaw \n  \n \n \n1 Canadian counsel has advised that under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act \n(“PIPEDA”), in the absence of a legal or regulatory requirement to disclose personal information, CPP Investments \nmay not disclose such information without consent, which consent is not included in the CPP Investments internal \nprivacy policy or standard employee consents.  This approach is consistent with our treatment of requests for personally identifiable information about CPP Investments employees during this process.  Accordingly, in lieu of \nnaming specific individuals who received the IC Memo, CPP Investments is providing in the updated redaction log \nprovided as Barlow Decl., Ex. D the titles for these individuals. \nSTATE OF MINNESOTA  \nOFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS  \n \nFOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION  \n \n \n \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota \nPower for the Acquisition of ALLETE by \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board and \nGlobal Infrastructure Partners  \n \n  OAH Docket No. 25 -2500 -40399  \nMPUC Docket E015/PA -24-198 \nMPUC Docket No. E -015/M -24-383 \n \n \nDECLARATION OF  RD GAUSS  IN SUPPORT OF CANADA PENSION PLAN \nINVESTMENT BOARD AND GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS’ \nRESPONSE  \n \n \nSTATE O F  ) \n    ) ss \nCOUNTY OF  ) \n I, RD G auss, declare under penalty of perjury as follows:  \n1.

McKenzie  \nAdministrative Law Judge  \nOffice of Administrative Hearings  \nState of Minnesota  \n \n      Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 \n      OAH Docket No. 25 -2500- 40339 \n \nDear Judge McKenzie,  \n \nI understand that you have received in this docket one or more submissions relating to my \nhandling of highly confidential material.  I write this letter not to contest those submissions —\nwhich I have not read—but only to summarize the facts in one place, to acknowledge my role in the situation, and to make clear that I accept the consequences that you or the Commission establish.  I have filed this letter consistent with your law clerk ’s instructions  received today .   \n \nThe confidential version of my testimony included quotes from HCTS materials. This \nletter describes events relating to that testimony, as best as I can remember them.  I have disclosed all these facts to GIP ’s counsel . \n \nMy client filed my testimony with the Commission on February 4, 2025.  My client  then \nemailed me both the public version and the HCTS version—the latter, it turned out, having a filename in which the client had inadvertently included the word PUBLIC.  On February 5, I \nposted the document whose filename included “ PUBLIC ” to my professional website.  On the \nevening of February 6, I posted on LinkedIn a link to that file on my website.  About 15 minutes later, I learned from my counsel that this file labeled PUBLIC was in fact the HCTS file.  I learned of that fact so soon af ter my LinkedIn posting because, coincidentally, my counsel saw \nmy LinkedIn post just after I made it and immediately contacted me about the labeling error.  I immediately had my assistant take the LinkedIn post down; she then removed the file  from my \nwebs ite.  I also then posted a message on LinkedIn stating that anyone who had accessed the file \nshould delete it and contact me immediately.  I have heard from no one.   \n \nMy counsel notified GIP ’s counsel of these facts the next day.  According to LinkedIn, \nmy second post  (the post saying to take the file down) had about 350 “impressions.”   I don’ t \nknow how many impressions the original post (the one with the link to the file  on my website ) \nbecause I deleted that post —as indicated, as soon as I learned of the problem and only 15 \nminutes after I ’d posted it —and didn’ t think at that time to look for the number of impressions.  \n \nWWW .SCOTTHEMPLINGLAW .COM \n \n \n2 \n (I believe that an “ impression ” means that someone saw the second post, not that someone \ndownloaded the document.)  At the request of GIP’s counsel, relayed to me by my counsel, I \nremoved the  second post ; i.e., the one that  that had alerted LinkedIn visitors to delete the file and \nto contact me.  \n \nOn February 5 around 1.40pm, I had sent the same mislabeled file to two colleagues who \nshare an interest in the subject.  When I learned of labeling error, I instructed them by email to \ndelete the document.  Both confirmed, by email February 7, that they had deleted the file and that \nthey had not opened the file.   \nThe day after I learned of the error, I instructed my assistant, at GIP counsel ’s request, to \ncontact GoDaddy, the company that hosts my website.  The purpose was to see if they could tell us about any downloads of the file from my website.  GoDaddy told my assistant that they do not have that capability.  GoDaddy recommended software for us to try.  My assistant tried the \nsoftware but determined that it tracked downloads only prospectively.  I informed my counsel of this fact, which he then transmitted to GIP ’s counsel. \n \nThe above discussion addresses my actions concerning the mislabeled file.  \n \nFor this 140- page document I had three assistants.  Two were proofreaders and one was a \nformatting expert.  They had access to the HCTS version of my testimony for a few days before I sent it to my client for filing on February 4, 2025.  They had no access to any HCTS material other than what was in my testimony.  I myself never downloaded any  HCTS material but rather \nread it from the source website.  \n \nOne of my proofreaders lacked a personal printe r—a fact that I did not know when I sent \nher the file for proofing.  When I informed her of the labeling error, I learned that to carry out the proofing task, she had emailed it to a nearby Federal Express office to have it printed there.  \n \nI have disclosed all the above facts to GIP ’s counsel.  \n \nThough my client informed GIP of the posting error the day after we discovered it, I \ndidn’ t inform my client and GIP of my internal helpers ’ access until later.  I was focused on the \npotential disclosure to the publ ic via my website and LinkedIn; that was the concern as it was \ninitially related to me from GIP.  It hadn ’t occurred to me at the time that there would be a \nconcern with my having my clerical assistants see the document , because it is my regular \npractice, and I assume the practice of other professionals, to use assistants to proof and format \nmy work, subject to my internal office requirement to maintain the confidentiality of that work.  Therefore I did not think to tell GIP that my assistants had had acces s to the document.  It was \nwhen GIP asked me about others ’ access that I explained my assistants ’ access.   \n \nThere was then a followup questionnaire from GIP, forwarded by my counsel late \nafternoon on Friday February 14, asking me more specifics.  I wrote answers early the next morning (Saturday, February 15) and then emailed them to my counsel for him to forward to GIP.  Because of t he three- day weekend, my counsel and I did not connect until late afternoon of \nTuesday, February 18.  At that time we agreed that he would send my February 15 summary to \n \nWWW .SCOTTHEMPLINGLAW .COM \n \n \n3 \n GIP’s counsel.  Early on February 19, I decided it was better to do so myself, and I so informed \nmy counsel.  I then reviewed my February 15 summary, added some details that I had not \nremembered when I wrote the February 15 draft, and emailed it to GIP ’s counsel.  On February \n20, I added one more fact to the document and emailed it GIP ’s counsel.  That additional fact \nwas that I  had forgotten, until the evening of February 19, to instruct one of my proofers to delete \nthe document . \n \nThe foregoing is my best memory of how I handled my assistants ’ access to the \ndocument.  \nHere are additional facts, presented here for completeness.    \n \n• My counsel informed me February 18 that in one of my emails to him to which I attached a confidential version of my testimony, I had cc -ed his Executive Director, \nwho had not signed the NDA.  My understanding is that the Executive Director did not open the document.  \n \n• I have deleted from my computer all confidential testimony in the proceeding, including my own confidential testimony.  I have not opened any of the confidential testimony submitted by others. \n \n• The only conversations in which I discusse d the confidential material were \nconversations with my client.  \n  \nIn summary:  I appreciate this opportunity to present the facts as I remember them.  I will of course accept the consequences.  \n  Sincerely,  \n \n \n Scott Hempling"

Sullivan  Vice C hair \nHwikwon Ham  Commissioner  \nAudrey Partridge  Commissioner  \nJohn Tuma  Commissioner  \n \n \nIn the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota  \nPower for Acquisition of ALLETE by  \nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board \nand Global Infrastructure Partners  OAH File No. 25 -2500 -40339  \nMPUC Docket No . E-015/PA -24-198 \n \nRESPONSE OF THE OFFICE  OF  \nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL — \nRESIDENTIAL UTILITIES DIVISION   \nTO THE DEPARTMENT’S  MOTION TO \nCOMPEL  DISCOVERY AND LIFT \nHIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL TRADE \nSECRET  DESIGNATIONS  \n \nThe Office of the Attorney General —Residential Utilities Division (OAG) submits this \nresponse to the Minnesota Department of Commerce’s m otion to compel discovery from Global \nInfrastructure Management LLC  (GIP)  and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) \n(collectively, “Partners”)  and to lift highly confidential trade secret (HCTS) designations from a \ndocument produced by the Partners .  \nAs the Department demonstrates  in its memorandum and declaration supporting its motion, \nthe Partners have withheld information that the parties to this proceeding are entitled to review by \nredact ing information , based on unsupported claims of privilege , within documents  that are \nalready  designated as HCTS .  They have also designated as HCTS  certain information that does \nnot meet the standard set out in the Administrative Law Judge’s HCTS Protective Order.   \n2 \n The information that the Department seeks to compel  is also relevant to the testimony of \nOAG witness Brian Lebens ,1 and the OAG therefore has an interest in its disclosure.  The OAG \nalso has an interest in transparency and believes the public should have access to the type of \ninformation in Ex. DOC -___, SLV -D-6 that can show the risks and benefits of the proposed \ntransaction.  By designating this entire document as HCTS, Partners have attempted to prevent the \npublic from understanding the full implications of the transaction.  \nRegarding the Partners’ claims of privilege, a s the Department’s motion, declaration, and \nattachments describe in detail, the context of many of the redactions show that the claimed legal advice appears to simply be future business plans.\n2  Notably, the redactions provided on the basis \nof privilege are internally inconsistent , where some pages are marked privileged and others are \nnot.3  Yet the Partners claim privilege applies to all.4  This lack of consistency draws into question \nthe validity of the privilege claims.  \nThe OAG also supports the Department’s request to remove the HCTS designation from \nEx. DOC -___, SLV -D-6 and make the document public. In this proceeding, the Commission is \ntasked with determining whether the transaction is in the public interest.5  The extensive and \nunsupported designations of information as HCTS  unjustifiably withholds information from the \npublic about items that concern their interests.  \nThe Partners ’ unjustifiable withholding of information from the Department, OAG , \nintervening parties, and the Commission based on unsupported claims of privilege prevents the \npublic -interest advocates and Commission from determining  whether the transaction’s benefits \n \n1 See Direct Testimony of Brian Lebens at Schedule 8.  \n2 See Memorandum Supporting Motion to Compel at 6- 7.  \n3 Compare  Decl. of Katherine Arnold, Ex. G -38–G-39 to  id., Ex. G -40–G -44.  \n4 See Decl. of Katherine Arnold, Ex. J -4.  \n5 Minn. Stat. § 216B.50, subd. 1.  \n3 \n will outweigh its costs.  And the vast amount of trade secret and HCTS designations by the Partners \nclouds the public’s view into the Commission’s public- interest determination.  What the Partners’  \nextensive redactions and refusal to turn over information does achieve is provide a foretaste of the \nlikely future regulatory battles that public -interest advocates may face if the transaction is \napproved.  \nThe OAG requests that Your Honor grant the Department’s request to allow the parties and \nCommission to review all relevant, non -privileged information to determine whether the \ntransaction is in the public interest and allow the public to review relevant information about the \nPartner s’ future plans for Minnesota Power and the impact of those plans on Minnesotans.   \n \nDated:   February 28, 2025 Respectfully submitted,  \n \nKEITH ELLISON  \nState of Minnesota Attorney General  \n \n/s/Katherine Hinderlie   \nKATHERINE HINDERLIE  \nAssistant Attorney General Atty.

INTRODUCTION  \nPursuant to Minn. R. 1400.6600, the Large Power Intervenors1 (“LPI”) hereby file this \nresponse in support of the Minnesota Department of Commerce’s (“Department”) Notice of and \nMotion to Compel Discovery and Lift HCTS Designations  (“Motion”) , filed in the above -\ncaption ed docket on February 13, 2025.2  LPI supports the Department’s Motion because (1) the \nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission  (“Commission”)  has directed development of a full record \nregarding “potential harms to the public interest from the proposed transaction, including in \n \n1 LPI is an ad hoc consortium of Large Power and Large Light and Power customers of Minnesota Power consisting \nfor purposes of this filing of Blandin Paper Company; Boise Paper, a Packaging Corporation of America company, \nformerly known as Boise, Inc.; Cleveland- Cliffs Minorca Mine Inc.; Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership; Gerdau \nAmeristeel US Inc.; Hibbing Taconite Company; Sappi Cl oquet, LLC; USG Interiors, Inc.; United States Steel \nCorporation (Keetac and Minntac Mines); and United Taconite, LLC.  \n2 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment \nBoard and Global Infrastructure Partners , MPUC Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 and OAH File No. 25- 2500 -40339, \nNotice of and Motion to Compel Discovery (February 13, 2025) (eDocket No. 20252 -215370- 01). \n2  relation to cost or risk,”3 and (2) the continued efforts of Global Infrastructure Management LLC \nand Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (collectively, “Partners”) at redaction, combined with \nan unwillingness to produce standard privilege logs, underscore the significant risk that the \nPartners will not be transparent and will rebuff each attempt to make reasonable disclosures.  For \nthese reasons, LPI supports the Department’s contention that the Partners have inappropriately \nimposed “Highly Confidential Trade Secret” (“HCTS”) restrictions on multiple discovery \nresponses, where such designations are not supported, and its request that the Administrative Law Judge order  the Partners to (1) make Ex. DOC -___, SLV -D-6 (“DOC IR SUPP 0011.01 \nAttach”)  public, and (2) provide unredacted copies of documents responsive to DOC IR Nos. \n13 and 60.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nMinn. R. 1400.6600 directs that for any motion made to the judge for an order shall \nadvise that other parties should “file a written response with the judge and service cop ies on \nall parties, within ten working days after it is received.”\n4  \nIII. ANALYSIS\nA) The Commission Has Directed, Not Recommended, Record Development on Cost\nand Risk.\nIn its October 7, 2024, Order Requiring Additional Information and Granting\nIntervention, and Notice of and Order for Hearing (“October Order”), the Commission stated \nits expectation for development of a full record to address certain issues, first and foremost  \ncovering “any potential harms to the public interest from the proposed transaction, including \nin relation to cost or risk.”5  In an effort to comply with the Commission’s directi ve, parties \nsubmitted discovery requests to the Partners aimed  to better understand how the financial  \ninformation and investment plans compiled by the Partners , which form core cost -related \ncomponents of the Acquisition impact ing ratepayers, will impact costs ultimately passed on \n3 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment \nBoard and Global Infrastructure Partners , Order Requiring Additional Information and Granting Intervention, and \nNotice of and Order for Hearing at 8 (October 7, 2024)  (“October Order”) . \n4 Minn. R. 1400.6600.   Although the timeframe appears limited to those parties contesting a motion, LPI submits this \nresponse in support of the Motion within the same referenced timeframe.   \n5 October Order at 8.  \n3  to consumers in the form of increased rates (i.e., DOC IRs 11, 13, and 60).6  Despite  parties’ \nattempts to gain insight into this critical information, the Partners have taken an overzealous \napproach to redacting  responses to DOC IRs 11, 13, and 60, effectively  hiding pertinent \ninformation related to the Partners’ valuation of ALLETE and Minnesota Power, which \npresumably impacts the Partners’ investment decision .  Such redaction eliminate s parties’ \nability to  effectively  discuss that financial and investment  information during either \nevidentiary hearings before the Administrative Law Judge or oral argument  and deliberations \nbefore the Commission .  Such arbitrary redaction contravenes the Commission’s explicit \ndirection to conduct transparent and open record development on cost and risk and represents \nimproper application of HCTS redaction on the part of the Partners.   The record development \nrequired by the Commission simply cannot coexist with  the overzealous redaction advanced \nby the Partners.   As such, LPI supports the Department’s request that the Administrative Law \nJudge direct the Partners to make DOC IR SUPP 0011.01 Attach public and provide \nunredacted copies of documents responsive to DOC IR Nos. 13 and 60. \nB) Partners ’ Inappropriate Redactions Underscore Significant Concerns About\nTransparency  and Their  Willingness to  Make Reasonable Disclosures.\nProceeding from the Partners’ continued efforts to inappropriately redact  non- HCTS\nfinancial and investment information, combined with their unwillingness to produce standard \nprivilege logs, LPI harbors significant concerns regarding the veracity of the Partners’ claims \nregarding transparency.  The Partners unwillingness to make reasonable disclosures at this stage \nof the proceeding indicates a pattern of behavior that contravenes the rules of discovery7 and the \nspirit of the regulatory compact.  LPI is also troubled by the Partners’ aggressive behavior in \nseeking to strike portions of testimony from the Citizens Utility Board (“CUB”) that should not \n6 DOC IR 11 requests all contracts, agreements, etc. between all entities involved or related to GIP Fund V and Tower \nBridge .  DOC IR 13 requests complete copies of any analyses GIP has conducted to value ALLETE or Minnesota \nPower.  DOC IR 60 requests copies of analyses CPP Investments has conducted related to the value of ALLETE or \nMinnesota Power, as well as any reports and/or presentations related to its valuation and decision to invest in ALLETE.  \n7 See Minn. R. Civ. P. 26.  \n4  only be public but are also presumably axiomatic , while simultaneously seeking to limit witness \naccess to testimony.8    \nWithout accountability at this stage of the proceeding, it is reasonable to assume that the \nPartners will continue to undermine statutorily -directed rules of discovery  and the directi ves of the \nCommission , while hiding  the true cost impacts of the Acquisition, to the detriment of ratepayers . \nFurther, ma ny ratepayer benefits that the Partners argue will be realized as a result of the \nAcquisition (not that LPI believes any exist) hinge on levels of transparency and trust that the \nPartners appear unwilling and unable to uphold.  When the Partners shun the opportunity to be \ntransparent and make reasonable disclosures at the earliest stages of the proceeding, LPI and other ratepayer representatives have no choice but to interpret that behavior as an indication of how the \nPartners wi ll act in the future and  as foreshadowing of the Partners’ intent to fight disclosure at \nevery opportunity.  In short, the Partners’ actions speak much louder than the words from their \ncounsel.  LPI urges action now to compel production of the public infor mation in DOC IR SUPP \n0011.01 Attach, as well as the provision of unredacted copies of documents responsive to DOC IR Nos. 13 and 60, so that parties may conduct the Commission- direct ed record \ndevelopment. \nIII. CONCLUSION\nLPI respectfully submits th is response in support of the Department’s Motion to ensure \nthat the Partners are held accountable to the levels of transparency and reasonable disclosure required to proceed through this docket, and to comport with the requirements of the Commission’s \nOctober Order.  \n8 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment \nBoard and Global Infrastructure Partners , MPUC Docket No. E- 015/PA -24-198 and OAH File No. 25- 2500 -40339 , \nNotice of Motion and Motion to Revoke Access and strike Direct Testimony of Scott Hempling (February 14, 2025) \n(eDocket No. 20252- 215428- 02).

Pursuant to Minnesota Rule 1400.6600 , the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota (“CUB”) \nhereby responds  to the Partners’ Motion.  For the reasons discussed below, CUB does not oppose \nPartners’ Motion ; however, CUB wishes to respond and add context to certain a spects of it.  \n \n1.) CUB no longer intends to oﬀer Mr. Hempling’s pre -ﬁled testimony into the evidentiary \nrecord.  \n \nCUB entered into a consulting agreement with Scott  Hempling , eﬀective as of September 25, \n2024  (“Consulting Agreement”) , so that Mr. Hempling could assist us in reviewing  the Petition ﬁled in \nthis proceeding .1 On February 18, 2025, CUB  and Mr. Hempling mutually agreed to terminate the \n \n1 See attached Declaration of Brian Edstrom at ¶ 3.  \n   \n \n 2  \n Consulting Agreement, with such termination eﬀective as of 5:00pm CST that day .2 For this reason, \nCUB no longer intends to oﬀer Mr. Hempling’s pre -ﬁled direct testimony into the evidentiary record \nin this matter. We  a l s o  d o  n o t  i n t e n d  f o r  M r .  H e m p l i n g  t o  p r e p a r e ,  o r  f o r  C U B  t o  ﬁ l e ,  rebuttal or  \nsurrebuttal testimony from Mr. Hempling.   \nPursuant to Paragraph 23 of Your Honor’s First Prehearing Order, “pre -ﬁled testimony that is \nnot oﬀered into the record [. . .] shall be considered withdrawn and no witness shall be cross-\nexamined concerning the withdrawn testimony.”3 CUB will respect and comply with whatever  other  \nactions Your Honor ﬁnds are warranted to resolve this matter.  \n \n2) We disagree the public version of Mr. Hempling’s Direct Testimony originally ﬁled on February \n4, 2025 breaches the HCTS Protective Order.  \n \nThe Partner’s suggest “Hempling’s Direct Testimony contains a substantial amount of [Highly \nConﬁdential Trade Secret (“ HCTS ”)] Information”  and implies that CUB/Mr. Hempling breached the \nHCTS Protective Order  when ﬁling the public version of Mr. Hempling’s Direct Testimony on February \n4, 2025.4 We disagree with this characterization of CUB’s February 4, 2025 ﬁling.  \nOn February 4, 2025, CUB ﬁled a public version of Mr. Hempling’s direct testimony in Docket \n24-198 and a not -public HCTS version of Mr. Hempling’s direct testimony in HCTS Docket No. M -24-\n383. The public version of Mr. Hempling’s direct testimony redacted certain information that one or more of the Petitioners had identiﬁed as HCTS. Such redactions appeared on 2 out of 146 pages and \n7 out of 176 footnotes of Mr. Hempling’s Direct Testimony.\n5  \nA memorandum of law ﬁled with  Partner’s Motion  states  that “the Partners determined that \nboth footnote 8 and 9, on page, 6 [of Mr. Hempling’s Direct Testimony] included public references to \n \n \n2 Id. at ¶ 27.  \n \n3 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global \nInfrastructure Partners, First Prehearing Order, OAH 25- 2500- 40339; MPUC Docket E -015/PA -24-198 (Oct. 28, 2024),  ¶ 23, Doc. \nId. 202410- 211370- 01. \n \n4 In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global  \nInfrastructure Partners, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Revoke Access and Strike Direct Testimony of Scott \nHempling, Docket No. E -015/PA -24-198 (Feb. 14, 2025)  (“Partners’ Memorandum”) , p. 6.  \n \n5 See generally, In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment B oard \nand Global Infrastructure Partners , Direct Testimony of Scott Hempling, Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 (Feb. 4, 2025, erratum ﬁled \nFeb. 6, 2025) (“Hempling Direct”), Doc.

Nevertheless, CUB honored the Partners’ request to re -ﬁle the public version of Mr. \nHempling’s direct testimony with minor changes to what was redacted in the original version. A full \ndescription of th ese minor changes, along with an explanation of CUB’s decision to not redact certain \ninformation from the original public version of Mr. Hempling’s testimony, is included in the attached HCTS Declaration  of Brian Edstrom.  \n \n3) CUB acted in g ood faith to disclose and address the disclosure of HCTS information .  \n \nThe memorandum attached to Partners’ Motion includes a description of facts the Partners \n“believe to be true”  based on information provided by CUB.8 CUB has, indeed, provided information \nto the Partners based on knowledge available to us at the time such information was provided. \nAttached here is a HCTS Declaration of Brian Edstrom, CUB’s Senior Regulatory Advocate, reporting  \nour understanding of what led to the disclosure of HCTS information on February 6, 2025 and the actions  CUB took following that disclosure to provide information to the Partners.  CUB has acted in \ngood faith to comply with both protective orders  issued  in this proceeding to address the unfortunate \nincident described in the Partners’ Motion.  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n6 Partners’ Memorandum at 6.  \n7 See generally, In the Matter of the Petition of Minnesota Power for Acquisition of ALLETE by Canada Pension Plan Investment B oard \nand Global Infrastructure Partners , CUB Letter, Docket No. E015/PA -24-198 (Feb. 6, 2025), Doc. Id. 20252- 215065- 01 \n \n8 Partners’ Memorandum at 7. \n   \n \n 4  \n As noted above, CUB does not oppose the Partners’ Motin to Strike and Revoke Access, and \nwe intend to not oﬀer Mr. Hempling ’s pre -ﬁled direct testimony into the evidentiary record. We will \nrespect and comply with whatever  further  actions Your Honor ﬁnds are warranted to resolve this \nmatter.  \n \nSincerely,         February 25, 2025  \n /s/ Brian Edstrom      \nBrian Edstrom  \nSenior Regulatory Advocate  \nCitizens Utility Board of Minnesota  \n651-300-4701, ext. 6  \nbriane@cubminnesota.org   \n \n \n \ncc: Service List"
